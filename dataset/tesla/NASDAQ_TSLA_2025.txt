class action litigation has been filed against us. While we defend such actions vigorously, any judgment against us or any future stockholder litigation
could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.
Our financial results may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in our operating costs and other factors.
We expect our period-to-period financial results to vary based on our operating costs, which we anticipate will fluctuate as the pace at which we
continue to design, develop and manufacture new products and increase production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facilities and
adding future facilities, may not be consistent or linear between periods. Additionally, our revenues from period to period may fluctuate as we introduce
existing products to new markets for the first time and as we develop and introduce new products. As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-
quarter comparisons of our financial results, especially in the short term, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied
upon as indicators of future performance. Moreover, our financial results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts, ratings agencies or
investors, who may be focused only on short-term quarterly financial results. If any of this occurs, the trading price of our stock could fall substantially,
either suddenly or over time.
We may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectations about our business, which could cause our stock price
to decline.
We provide from time to time guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance. Correctly identifying key factors affecting
business conditions and predicting future events is inherently an uncertain process, and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate and has in the past
been inaccurate in certain respects, such as the timing of new product manufacturing ramps. Our guidance is based on certain assumptions such as those
relating to anticipated production and sales volumes (which generally are not linear throughout a given period), average sales prices, supplier and
commodity costs and planned cost reductions. If our guidance varies from actual results, such as due to our assumptions not being met or the impact on
our financial performance that could occur as a result of various risks and uncertainties, the market value of our common stock could decline significantly.
If Elon Musk were forced to sell shares of our common stock, either that he has pledged to secure certain personal loan obligations,
or in satisfaction of other obligations, such sales could cause our stock price to decline.
Certain banking institutions have made extensions of credit to Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, a portion of which was used to purchase
shares of common stock in certain of our public offerings and private placements at the same prices offered to third-party participants in such offerings
and placements. We are not a party to these loans, which are partially secured by pledges of a portion of the Tesla common stock currently owned by Mr.
Musk. If the price of our common stock were to decline substantially, Mr. Musk may be forced by one or more of the banking institutions to sell shares of
Tesla common stock to satisfy his loan obligations if he could not do so through other means. Any such sales could cause the price of our common stock
to decline further. Further, Mr. Musk from time to time may commit to investing in significant business or other ventures, and as a result, be required to
sell shares of our common stock in satisfaction of such commitments.
Anti-takeover provisions contained in our governing documents, applicable laws and certain of our debt facilities could impair a
takeover attempt.
Our certificate of formation and bylaws afford certain rights and powers to our board of directors that may facilitate the delay or prevention of an
acquisition that it deems undesirable. We are also subject to Section 21.606 of the Texas Business Organizations Code and other provisions of Texas law
that limit the ability of stockholders in certain situations to effect certain business combinations. In addition, a change in control may cause the
acceleration of certain of our debt facilities. Any of the foregoing provisions and terms that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control
could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some
investors are willing to pay for our common stock.

ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY
Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy
We recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in
Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K. These risks include, among other things: operational risks, intellectual property theft, fraud, extortion, harm to employees
or customers and violation of data privacy or security laws.
Identifying and assessing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes. Cybersecurity risks related to our
business, technical operations, privacy and compliance issues are identified and addressed through a multi-faceted approach including third party
assessments, internal IT Audit, IT security, governance, risk and compliance reviews. To defend, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, we,
among other things: conduct proactive privacy and cybersecurity reviews of systems and applications, audit applicable data policies, perform penetration
testing using external third-party tools and techniques to test security controls, operate a bug bounty program to encourage proactive vulnerability
reporting, conduct employee training, monitor emerging laws and regulations related to data protection and information security (including our consumer
products) and implement appropriate changes.
We have implemented incident response and breach management processes which have four overarching and interconnected stages: 1)
preparation for a cybersecurity incident, 2) detection and analysis of a security incident, 3) containment, eradication and recovery, and 4) post-incident
analysis. Such incident responses are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding
matters of cybersecurity.
Security events and data incidents are evaluated, ranked by severity and prioritized for response and remediation. Incidents are evaluated to
determine materiality as well as operational and business impact, and reviewed for privacy impact.
We also conduct tabletop exercises to simulate responses to cybersecurity incidents. Our team of cybersecurity professionals then collaborate with
technical and business stakeholders across our business units to further analyze the risk to the company, and form detection, mitigation and remediation
strategies.
As part of the above processes, we regularly engage external auditors and consultants to assess our internal cybersecurity programs and
compliance with applicable practices and standards. As of 2024, our Information Security Management System has been certified to conform to the
requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2013.
Our risk management program also assesses third party risks, and we perform third-party risk management to identify and mitigate risks from third
parties such as vendors, suppliers, and other business partners associated with our use of third-party service providers. Cybersecurity risks are evaluated
when determining the selection and oversight of applicable third-party service providers and potential fourth-party risks when handling and/or processing
our employee, business or customer data. In addition to new vendor onboarding, we perform risk management during third-party cybersecurity
compromise incidents to identify and mitigate risks to us from third-party incidents.
We describe whether and how risks from identified cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have
materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, under the
heading “Our information technology systems or data, or those of our service providers or customers or users could be subject to cyber-attacks or other
security incidents, which could result in data breaches, intellectual property theft, claims, litigation, regulatory investigations, significant liability,
reputational damage and other adverse consequences” included as part of our risk factor disclosures at Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Cybersecurity Governance
Cybersecurity is an important part of our risk management processes and an area of focus for our Board and management. Our Audit Committee is
responsible for the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats.Members of the Audit Committee receive updates on a quarterly basis from senior
management, including leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance and Legal teams regarding matters of cybersecurity. This
includes existing and new cybersecurity risks, status on how management is addressing and/or mitigating those risks, cybersecurity and data privacy
incidents (if any) and status on key information security initiatives. Our Board members also engage in ad hoc conversations with management on
cybersecurity-related news events and discuss any updates to our cybersecurity risk management and strategy programs.
28

--- Page 32 ---

Our cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes are overseen by leaders from our Information Security, Product Security, Compliance
and Legal teams. Such individuals have an average of over 15 years of prior work experience in various roles involving information technology, including
security, auditing, compliance, systems and programming. These individuals are informed about, and monitor the prevention, mitigation, detection and
remediation of cybersecurity incidents through their management of, and participation in, the cybersecurity risk management and strategy processes
described above, including the operation of our incident response plan, and report to the Audit Committee on any appropriate items.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included
elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For further discussion of our products and services, technology and competitive strengths, refer to Item 1-
Business. For discussion related to changes in financial condition and the results of operations for fiscal year 2023-related items, refer to Part II, Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2023, which was
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 29, 2024.
Overview and 2024 Highlights
Our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell high-performance fully
electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance, installation, operation, charging, insurance,
financial and other services related to our products. Additionally, we are increasingly focused on products and services based on AI, robotics and
automation.
In 2024, we produced approximately 1,773,000 consumer vehicles and delivered approximately 1,789,000 consumer vehicles. We are focused on
profitable growth, including by leveraging existing factories and production lines to introduce new and more affordable products, further improving and
deploying our FSD (Supervised) capabilities, including future autonomous capabilities through our purpose-built Robotaxi product, Cybercab, reducing
costs, increasing vehicle production, utilized capacity and delivery capabilities, improving and developing our vehicles and battery technologies, vertically
integrating and localizing our supply chain, and expanding our global infrastructure, including our service and charging infrastructure.
In 2024, we deployed 31.4 GWh of energy storage products. We are focused on ramping the production and increasing the market penetration of
our energy storage products.
In 2024, we recognized total revenues of $97.69 billion, representing an increase of $917 million compared to the prior year. In 2024, our net
income attributable to common stockholders was $7.09 billion, representing a decrease of $7.91 billion compared to the prior year, primarily due to the
impact of releasing $6.54 billion of our valuation allowance associated with U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of 2023.We
continue to ramp production and build and optimize our manufacturing capacity, expand our operations while focusing on further cost reductions and
operational efficiencies to enable increased deliveries and deployments of our products, and invest in research and development to accelerate our AI,
software, and fleet-based profits for further revenue growth.
We ended 2024 with $36.56 billion in cash and cash equivalents and investments, representing an increase of $7.47 billion from the end of 2023.
Our cash flows provided by operating activities were $14.92 billion in 2024 compared to $13.26 billion in 2023, representing an increase of $1.67 billion.
Capital expenditures amounted to $11.34 billion in 2024 compared to $8.90 billion in 2023, representing an increase of $2.44 billion. Overall growth has
allowed our business to generally fund itself, and we will continue investing in a number of capital-intensive projects and research and development in
upcoming periods.

Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2025 Outlook
Automotive—Production
The following is a summary of the status of production of each of our announced vehicle models in production and under development, as of the
date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:
Region Vehicle Model(s) Production Status
California Model S / Model X Active
Model 3 / Model Y Active
Shanghai Model 3 / Model Y Active
Berlin Model Y Active
Texas Model Y Active
Cybertruck Active
Cybercab In development
Nevada Tesla Semi Pilot production
TBD Roadster In development
We are focused on growing our manufacturing capacity, which includes capacity for manufacturing newer vehicle models such as our Cybertruck,
Tesla Semi and future vehicles utilizing aspects of our next generation platform, and ramping the production at our Gigafactories to their installed
production capacities as well as increasing production rate and efficiency at our current factories. The next phase of production growth will depend on the
continued ramp at our factories and be initiated by advances in autonomy and the introduction of new products, including those built on our next
generation vehicle platform, as well as our ability to add to our available sources of battery cell supply by manufacturing our own cells that we are
developing to have high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. Our goals are to improve vehicle performance, decrease
production costs and increase affordability and customer awareness.
These plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by new product
and manufacturing technologies we introduce, the number of concurrent international projects, any industry-wide component constraints, labor shortages
and any future impact from events outside of our control. For example, during the first quarter of 2024, we experienced a sequential decline in production
volumes partially caused by the early phase of the production ramp of the updated Model 3 at our Fremont factory, and factory shutdowns at Gigafactory
Berlin-Brandenburg resulting from shipping diversions caused by the Red Sea conflict and an arson attack. In the first quarter of 2025, as we launch our
New Model Y worldwide, we may similarly experience delays or declines in production volumes due to simultaneous manufacturing ramps in facilities on
three continents. Moreover, we have set ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and design
improvements for our vehicles with each new factory.
Automotive—Demand, Sales, Deliveries and Infrastructure
Our cost reduction efforts, cost innovation strategies, and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles’ affordability
and have allowed us to competitively price our vehicles. We will also continue to generate demand by improving our vehicles’ performance and
functionality, including through product offerings and features based on artificial intelligence such as Autopilot, FSD (Supervised), and other software, and
delivering new vehicles and vehicle options, such as our launch of the updated Model 3 in 2024, and the New Model Y in the first quarter of 2025. In
addition, we have been increasing awareness, and expanding our vehicle financing programs, including attractive leasing terms for our customers.

However, we operate in a cyclical industry that is sensitive to shifting consumer trends, political and regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to
trade and the environment, all of which can be compounded by inflationary pressures, rising energy prices, interest rate fluctuations and the liquidity of
enterprise customers. For example, as inflationary pressures increased across the markets in which we operate, central banks in developed countries
raised interest rates rapidly and substantially, which impacted the affordability of vehicle lease and finance arrangements. Further, sales of vehicles in the
automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose us to increased volatility as we expand and adjust our operations.
Moreover, as additional competitors enter the marketplace and help bring the world closer to sustainable transportation, we will have to adjust and
continue to execute well to maintain our momentum. Additionally, our suppliers’ liquidity and allocation plans may be affected by current challenges in
the North American automotive industry, which could reduce our access to components or result in unfavorable changes to cost. These macroeconomic
and industry trends have had, and will likely continue to have, an impact on the pricing of, and order rate for our vehicles, and in turn our operating
margin. Changes in government and economic policies, incentives or tariffs may also impact our production, sales, cost structure and the competitive
landscape. We will continue to adjust accordingly to such developments, and we believe our ongoing cost reduction, including improved production
innovation and efficiency at our newest factories and lower logistics costs, and focus on operating leverage will continue to benefit us in relation to our
competitors, while our new products will help enable future growth.
As our production increases, we must work constantly to similarly increase vehicle delivery capability so that it does not become a bottleneck on our
total deliveries. We are also committed to reducing the percentage of vehicles delivered in the third month of each quarter, which will help to reduce the
cost per vehicle. As we expand our manufacturing operations globally, we will also have to continue to increase and staff our delivery, servicing and
charging infrastructure accordingly, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost effectiveness and customer
satisfaction. In particular, as other automotive manufacturers have announced their adoption of the North American Charging Standard (“NACS”) and
agreements with us to utilize our Superchargers, we must correspondingly expand our network in order to ensure adequate availability to meet customer
demands. We also remain focused on continued enhancements of the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations.
Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment
The long-term success of this business is dependent upon incremental volume growth. We continue to increase the production and capabilities of
our energy storage products to meet high levels of demand, including the introduction of Powerwall 3 in 2024, and the ramps of our Megafactories in
Shanghai and Lathrop, California. For Megapack, energy storage deployments can vary meaningfully quarter to quarter depending on the timing of
specific project milestones and logistics. As these product lines grow, we will have to maintain adequate battery cell supply for our energy storage
products. At the same time, changes in government and economic incentives or tariffs may also impact our sales, cost structure and the competitive
landscape.
Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends
Our capital expenditures are typically difficult to project beyond the short-term given the number and breadth of our core projects at any given time,
and may further be impacted by uncertainties in future global market conditions. We are simultaneously developing and ramping new products, building
or ramping manufacturing facilities on three continents, piloting the development and manufacture of new battery cell technologies, expanding our
Supercharger network and investing in autonomy and other artificial intelligence enabled training and products, and the pace of our capital spend may
vary depending on overall priority among projects, the pace at which we meet milestones, production adjustments to and among our various products,
increased capital efficiencies and the addition of new projects. Owing and subject to the foregoing as well as the pipeline of announced projects under
development, all other continuing infrastructure growth and varying levels of inflation, we currently expect our capital expenditures to exceed $11.00
billion in 2025 and in each of the following two fiscal years.
Our business has generally been consistently generating cash flow from operations in excess of our level of capital spend, and with better working
capital management resulting in shorter days sales outstanding than days payable outstanding, our sales growth is also generally facilitating positive
cash generation. We have and will continue to utilize such cash flows, among other things, to invest in autonomy, do more vertical integration, expand
our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers. At the same time, we are likely to see heightened levels of capital expenditures
during certain periods depending on the specific pace of our capital-intensive projects and other potential variables such as rising material prices and
increases in supply chain and labor expenses resulting from changes in global trade conditions and labor availability. Overall, we expect our ability to be
self-funding to continue as long as macroeconomic factors support current trends in our sales.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”). The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period.
Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an
ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.
The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return
reserves, resale value guarantee liabilities, income tax, the collectability of accounts and finance receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of
long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject
to leases could be impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our
estimates and assumptions or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-
K. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions.
Revenue Recognition
Automotive Sales
Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that
meet the definition of a performance obligation under Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”),
including access to our FSD (Supervised) features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air
software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments
are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which
payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for
expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our
internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized
over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging
incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other features and services
over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD (Supervised) features is recognized
when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales,
we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other
information that may be available.
Inventory Valuation
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which
approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about
current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.
We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory.
This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product.
Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result
in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.
Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small
change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.
35

--- Page 39 ---

Warranties
We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation
and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our
best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims
incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our
historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include
projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs,
as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12
months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated
amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-
current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.
Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.
Stock-Based Compensation
We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees and for our employee
stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock
option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are
subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our
common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards,
usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is
recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.
For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual
performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.
As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may
calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based
compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and
development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for
income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets that are not more likely
than not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In
completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted
for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in
recent prior years, and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. We also rely on our assessment of the Company’s projected
future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to historical results, volatility in the market price of our
common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in
business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of
future results considering all available information.
36

--- Page 40 ---

Furthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and
calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes or taxes
payable based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are
supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that some of those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are
required to file income tax returns in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in
effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to
our tax positions. We believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past
experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax
audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations,
such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.

Automotive & Services and Other Segment
Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, including access to our FSD (Supervised)
features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates. These deliveries are
vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.
Automotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from automotive regulatory
credits is directly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We monetize them proactively as new vehicles
are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or
changes in regulation impacting the credits.
Automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements. Additionally, automotive
leasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the
customer.
Services and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision, part sales, paid Supercharging,
insurance services revenue and retail merchandise sales.
2024 compared to 2023
Automotive sales revenue decreased $6.03 billion, or 8%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31,
2023, primarily due to lower average selling price on our vehicles driven by overall price reductions and attractive financing options provided in 2024 as
well as mix. Additionally, there was a decrease of approximately 22,000 combined Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries. The decreases were partially
offset by an increase of approximately 19,000 deliveries of other models primarily due to our production ramp of Cybertruck. Additionally, we recognized
$596 million of FSD (Supervised) revenue due to release of certain features in 2024.

Automotive regulatory credits revenue increased $973 million, or 54%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2023, driven by demand for credits in North America as other automobile manufacturers scale back on their battery electric vehicle plans.
Automotive leasing revenue decreased $293 million, or 14%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31,
2023, primarily due to lower direct sales-type leasing deliveries as we have shifted towards providing leasing options through commercial banking partner
programs that allow for us to recognize upfront revenue in automotive sales and a decrease in lease buyouts.
Services and other revenue increased $2.22 billion, or 27%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31,
2023, primarily due to increases in sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision revenue, paid Supercharging revenue,
insurance services revenue and part sales revenue.
Energy Generation and Storage Segment
Energy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products, financing of solar energy
generation products, services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives.
2024 compared to 2023
Energy generation and storage revenue increased $4.05 billion, or 67%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2023, primarily due to a 16.7 GWh increase in Megapack and Powerwall deployments compared to the prior year.

and machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, FSD (Supervised) ongoing maintenance costs, allocations of electricity and
infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes
adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to
provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of automotive sales revenue benefits from manufacturing
credits earned.
Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases
and warranty expense related to leased vehicles.
Costs of services and other revenue includes cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs associated with providing non-warranty
after-sales services, costs associated with our body shops and part sales, costs of paid Supercharging, costs to provide vehicle insurance and costs of
retail merchandise sales.
2024 compared to 2023
Cost of automotive sales revenue decreased $3.25 billion, or 5%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2023 due to a decrease in the average combined cost per unit of our vehicles primarily from lower raw material costs, freight and duties as
well as mix, in addition to the volume changes in deliveries year over year as discussed above. The decreases were partially offset by higher costs for
Cybertruck.
Cost of automotive leasing revenue decreased $265 million, or 21%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in direct sales-type leasing cost of revenue driven by lower deliveries and a decrease in our direct
operating lease cost of revenue driven by lower lease buyouts compared to the prior periods.
Cost of services and other revenue increased $2.09 billion, or 27%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2023, primarily due to volume increases in used vehicle sales at lower average vehicle acquisition cost, insurance services, paid
Supercharging, part sales and non-warranty maintenance services and collision.
Gross margin for total automotive decreased from 19.4% to 18.4% in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2023 due to lower average selling price on our vehicles and Cybertruck ramp, partially offset by lower average combined cost per unit of
our vehicles and increases in regulatory credit and FSD (Supervised) revenue, as discussed above.
Gross margin for total automotive & services and other segment decreased from 18.2% to 16.9% in the year ended December 31, 2024 as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The changes in gross margin are primarily due to the automotive gross margin factors discussed above.
Energy Generation and Storage Segment
Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including
depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, freight, warranty expense, and cost of servicing. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also
includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-
hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of energy generation and storage revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned.
In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased
solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.
2024 compared to 2023
Cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased $2.55 billion, or 52%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year
ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to increases in Megapack and Powerwall deployments, partially offset by increases in IRA manufacturing credits
recognized as compared to the prior year.

--- Page 43 ---

Gross margin for energy generation and storage increased from 18.9% to 26.2% in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year
ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to margin improvements for our energy storage products driven by cost reductions, including benefits from IRA
manufacturing credits, and a higher proportion of our storage business, which operated at a higher gross margin, within the segment as compared to the
prior periods.
Research and Development Expense

As a percentage of revenues 5 % 4 % 4 %
Research and development (“R&D”) expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research, manufacturing
engineering and manufacturing test organizations, prototyping expense, contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense.
R&D expenses increased $571 million, or 14%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The
overall increases were primarily driven by additional costs year over year related to AI programs. R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue increased
from 4% to 5% in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 as we continue to expand our product roadmap

In the second quarter of 2024, we initiated and substantially completed certain restructuring actions to reduce costs and improve efficiency. As a
result, we recognized $583 million of employee termination expenses in Restructuring and other in our consolidated income statement. These expenses
were substantially paid with an immaterial accrual remaining in Accrued liabilities and other in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.

Other income (expense), net $ 695 $ 172 $ (43) $ 523 304% $ 215 Not meaningful
Other income (expense), net, consists of foreign exchange gains and losses related to our foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and
liabilities and fair value remeasurements of our digital assets following the adoption of ASU 2023-08 effective January 1, 2024. See Note 2, Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.
Other income (expense), net, changed favorably by $523 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2023 primarily due to remeasurement of our bitcoin digital assets to fair value in 2024 (see above), partially offset by unfavorable
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our intercompany balances. As our intercompany balances are significant in nature and we do not
typically hedge foreign currency risk, we can experience significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses from period to period.

Effective tax rate 20 % (50)% 8 %
Our provision for (benefit from) income taxes changed by $6.84 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended
December 31, 2023. Our effective tax rate changed to an expense of 20% in the year ended December 31, 2024 from a benefit of 50% in the year ended
December 31, 2023. These changes are primarily due to the impact of releasing the valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets in the fourth
quarter of 2023.
We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In the fourth quarter of 2023,
based on the relevant weight of positive and negative evidence, including the amount of our taxable income in recent years which was objective and
verifiable, and consideration of our expected future taxable earnings, we concluded that it is more likely than not that most of our U.S. federal and certain
state deferred tax assets are realizable and released $6.54 billion of our valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2024, we continue to conclude that it is
more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are realizable, except for our California deferred tax assets, U.S. foreign tax credits and certain foreign
operating losses.
See Note 13, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We expect to continue to generate net positive operating cash flow. The cash we generate from our core operations enables us to fund ongoing
operations and production, our research and development projects for new products and technologies including our proprietary battery cells, additional
manufacturing ramps at existing manufacturing facilities, the construction of future factories, and the continued expansion of our retail and service
locations, body shops, Mobile Service fleet, Supercharger, including to support NACS, energy product installation capabilities and autonomy and other
artificial intelligence enabled products.
In addition, because a large portion of our future expenditures will be to fund our growth, we expect that if needed we will be able to adjust our
capital and operating expenditures by operating segment. For example, if our near-term manufacturing operations decrease in scale or ramp more slowly
than expected, including due to global economic or business conditions, we may choose to correspondingly slow the pace of our capital expenditures.
Finally, we continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid
growth of our business, including through drawdowns on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds. Conversely, we may also from time to time
determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily repay certain indebtedness early.

Accordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following December 31,
2024, as well as in the long-term.
See the sections below for more details regarding the material requirements for cash in our business and our sources of liquidity to meet such
needs.
Material Cash Requirements
From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements with vendors for the purchase of components and raw materials to
be used in the manufacture of our products. However, due to contractual terms, variability in the precise growth curves of our development and
production ramps, and opportunities to renegotiate pricing, we generally do not have binding and enforceable purchase orders under such contracts
beyond the short-term, and the timing and magnitude of purchase orders beyond such period is difficult to accurately project.
As discussed in and subject to the considerations referenced in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations—Management Opportunities, Challenges and Uncertainties and 2025 Outlook—Cash Flow and Capital Expenditure Trends in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, we currently expect our capital expenditures to support our projects globally to exceed $11.00 billion in 2025 and in each of
the following two fiscal years.
As of December 31, 2024, we and our subsidiaries had outstanding $7.91 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness, of which $2.35
billion is current. As of December 31, 2024, our total minimum lease payments was $7.05 billion, of which $1.19 billion is due in the succeeding 12
months. For details regarding our indebtedness and lease obligations, refer to Note 10, Debt, and Note 11, Leases, to the consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Sources and Conditions of Liquidity
Our sources to fund our material cash requirements are predominantly from our deliveries and servicing of new and used vehicles, sales and
installations of our energy storage products, interest income, and proceeds from debt facilities and equity offerings, when applicable.
As of December 31, 2024, we had $16.14 billion and $20.42 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively. Balances
held in foreign currencies had a U.S. dollar equivalent of $2.90 billion and consisted primarily of euros and Chinese yuan. We had $5.00 billion of unused
committed credit amounts as of December 31, 2024. For details regarding our indebtedness, refer to Note 10, Debt, to the consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We continue adapting our strategy to meet our liquidity and risk objectives, such as investing in U.S. government securities and other investments,
invest in autonomy, do more vertical integration, expand our product roadmap and provide financing options to our customers.
Summary of Cash Flows
Year Ended December 31,
(Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2022
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 14,923 $ 13,256 $ 14,724
Net cash used in investing activities $ (18,787) $ (15,584) $ (11,973)
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 3,853 $ 2,589 $ (3,527)
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as
research and development and selling, general and administrative and working capital. Our operating cash inflows include cash from vehicle sales and
related servicing, customer lease and financing payments, customer deposits, cash from sales of regulatory credits and energy generation and storage
products, and interest income on our cash and investments portfolio. These cash inflows are offset by our payments to suppliers for production materials
and parts used in our manufacturing process, operating expenses, operating lease payments and interest payments on our financings.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $1.67 billion to $14.92 billion during the year ended December 31, 2024 from $13.26 billion
during the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to favorable changes in net operating assets and liabilities of $2.29 billion,
partially offset by a decrease in net income excluding non-cash expenses, gains and losses of $623 million.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Net cash flows from investing activities and their variability across each period related primarily to capital expenditures, which were $11.34 billion
and $8.90 billion for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, mainly for AI-related capital expenditures, global factory expansion and
machinery and equipment as we expand and enhance our product roadmap. We also purchased $7.45 billion and $6.62 billion of investments, net of
proceeds from maturities and sales, for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Net cash flows from financing activities increased by $1.26 billion to $3.85 billion during the year ended December 31, 2024 from $2.59 billion
during the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $1.81 billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt, partially offset
by a $1.15 billion increase in repayments of debt. See Note 10, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for further details regarding our debt obligations. Additionally, there was an increase of $541 million in proceeds from exercises of stock
options and other stock issuances compared to the prior year.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Foreign Currency Risk
We transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, costs of revenue and operating
expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar (primarily the Chinese yuan and euro in relation to our current year operations). In general,
we are a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar for our foreign subsidiaries. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our operating
results as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk.
We have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re-
measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and
cash and cash equivalents balances).
We considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign
currency exchange rates of 10% for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on
our net income before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in a gain or loss of $1.15 billion at December 31, 2024 and $1.01 billion at
December 31, 2023, assuming no foreign currency hedging.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Tesla, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tesla, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023,
and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of redeemable noncontrolling interests and equity and of cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial
statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for digital assets in 2024.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and
the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a
test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated
financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not
alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,
providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Automotive Warranty Reserve
As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, total accrued warranty, which primarily relates to the automotive segment, was $6,716
million as of December 31, 2024. The Company provides a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles. A warranty reserve is accrued for
these products sold, which includes management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty and recalls if identified.
These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the automotive warranty reserve is a critical audit matter are (i)
the significant judgment by management in determining the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models; (ii) a high degree of auditor
judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to the nature, frequency and
costs of future claims for certain Tesla vehicle models; and, (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s estimate of the automotive warranty
reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models, including controls over management’s significant assumptions related to the nature, frequency and costs of
future claims as well as the completeness and accuracy of actual claims incurred to date. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing the
completeness and accuracy of historical vehicle claims processed and testing that such claims were appropriately used by management in the estimation
of future claims and (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of management’s
estimate by (a) developing an independent estimate of the automotive warranty reserve for certain Tesla vehicle models and (b) comparing the
independent estimate to management’s estimate. Developing the independent estimate involved evaluating the appropriateness of certain aspects of
management’s significant assumptions related to the nature and frequency of future claims.

Tesla, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 – Overview
Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003 and converted to a Texas
corporation on June 13, 2024. We design, develop, manufacture, sell and lease high-performance fully electric vehicles and energy generation and
storage systems, and offer services related to our products.
Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP and reflect our accounts and operations and
those of our subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation (“ASC 810”), we
consolidate any variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We have formed VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary
course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our
direct vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity;
however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC
810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the
VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits
from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not
considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs (see Note 15, Variable Interest Entity
Arrangements). We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the accompanying notes. The estimates used for, but not limited to,
determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, resale value guarantee liabilities, income
taxes, the collectability of accounts and finance receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of financial
instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed
the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the
carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur
and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Reclassifications
Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the
accompanying notes.

Revenue Recognition
Revenue by source
The following table disaggregates our revenue by major source (in millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2024 2023 2022
Automotive sales $ 72,480 $ 78,509 $ 67,210
Automotive regulatory credits 2,763 1,790 1,776
Energy generation and storage sales 9,564 5,515 3,376
Services and other 10,534 8,319 6,091

Automotive leasing 1,827 2,120 2,476
Energy generation and storage leasing 522 520 533
Total revenues $ 97,690 $ 96,773 $ 81,462
Automotive Segment
Automotive Sales
Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that
meet the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our FSD(Supervised) features and their ongoing maintenance, internet
connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer,
which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms
customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return
reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback
terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are
provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such
services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We
recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle.
Revenue related to FSD (Supervised) features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their ongoing maintenance is recognized
over time. For our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the
service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.
Any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized upfront as an offset against
automotive sales revenue. Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs related to automotive
sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and
handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts
or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a
customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.
We offer resale value guarantees to our commercial banking partners in connection with certain vehicle leasing programs. Under these programs,
we originate the lease with our end customer and immediately transfer the lease and the underlying vehicle to our commercial banking partner, with the
transaction being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606.

We receive upfront payment for the vehicle, do not bear casualty and credit risks during the lease term, and we provide a guarantee capped to a
limit if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle’s contractual or determined residual value at the end of the lease term. We estimate a
guarantee liability in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees and record it within other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. On a quarterly basis,
we assess the estimated market value of vehicles sold under these programs to determine whether there have been changes to the amount of expected
resale value guarantee liabilities. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be
material changes to their estimated values. The total recorded guarantee liabilities on vehicles sold under these programs were immaterial as of
December 31, 2024 and 2023. Our maximum exposure on the guarantees we provide if they are unable to sell the vehicle at or above the vehicle’s
contractual residual value at the end of the lease term was $1.45 billion and $166 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Deferred revenue related to the access to our FSD (Supervised) features and their ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging
programs and over-the-air software updates primarily on automotive sales consisted of the following (in millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2024 2023
Deferred revenue — beginning of period $ 3,536 $ 2,913
Additions 1,343 1,201
Net changes in liability for pre-existing contracts,
including foreign exchange impact (92) 17
Revenue recognized (1,188) (595)
Deferred revenue — end of period $ 3,599 $ 3,536
Deferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as
of the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $872 million and $469 million
for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of the total deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2024, we expect to recognize
$840 million of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be recognized at the time of transfer of control of the product or over the
performance period as discussed above in Automotive Sales.
We have financing receivables on our consolidated balance sheets related to loans we provide for financing our automotive deliveries. As of
December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had current net financing receivables of $247 million and $242 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net, and
$821 million and $1.04 billion, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion.
Automotive Regulatory Credits
We earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under various regulations related to ZEVs, greenhouse gas, fuel economy and
clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements.
Payments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment
terms customary to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits, which have negligible incremental costs associated
with them, at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party. Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory
credits was immaterial as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022
was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we had also recognized $288 million in
revenue due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration for credits sold previously. We have elected the practical expedient to
omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected contract
length of one year or less. As of December 31, 2024, total transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially
unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $4.68 billion. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $863 million in
the next 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period. Additionally, changes in regulations on automotive regulatory credits
may significantly impact our remaining performance obligations and revenue to be recognized under these contracts.

Automotive Leasing Revenue
Direct Vehicle Operating Leasing Program
We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs in the U.S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe. Qualifying
customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers may opt to return the vehicles
to us or purchase the vehicles when contractually permitted. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues
to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive
leasing revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $1.78 billion, $1.86 billion and $1.75 billion of direct vehicle
leasing revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had deferred $394 million and $458 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront
payments, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases.
Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.
Direct Sales-Type Leasing Program
We have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842, Leases
(“ASC 842”), in certain countries in Asia and Europe. Our arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months. We recognize all
revenue and costs associated with the sales-type lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon
delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as
customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $12 million, $215 million and $683
million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue and $7 million, $164 million and $427 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue.
Services and Other Revenue
Services and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and collision, part sales, paid Supercharging,
insurance services revenue and retail merchandise sales.
Revenues related to repair, maintenance and vehicle insurance services are recognized over time as services are provided and extended service
plans are recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell
used vehicles, services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue
allocation to the extent that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for used vehicles, services, vehicle
components, and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms customary
to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within Accrued
liabilities and other on the consolidated balance sheets. We record in Deferred revenue any non-refundable prepayment amounts that are collected from
customers and unearned insurance premiums, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. Deferred revenue
excluding unearned insurance premiums was not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Energy Generation and Storage Segment
Energy Generation and Storage Sales
Energy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential, small
commercial, large commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small-scale commercial customers consist of
the engineering, design and installation of the system. Residential and small-scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy
system upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system
and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small-scale
commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the
product has been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon
invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.
56

--- Page 61 ---

For certain large commercial and utility grade energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system,
customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time
using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales.
In instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the
contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by using
market data for comparable products. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of energy
storage systems. As our contract costs related to energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are
expensed as incurred.
As part of certain energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying
system will meet or exceed the minimum energy performance requirements specified in the contract. If an energy storage system does not meet the
performance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large
commercial and utility grade energy storage system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market
participation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract
inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates
are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.
We record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are primarily related to prepayments from customers, which is recognized as
revenue as or when the performance obligations are satisfied. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, deferred revenue related to such customer payments
amounted to $1.77 billion and $1.60 billion, respectively, mainly due to contractual payment terms. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue
balance as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $1.27 billion and $571 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We have
elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy
generation and storage sales with an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to invoice when that
amount corresponds directly with the value of the performance to date. As of December 31, 2024, total transaction price allocated to performance
obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $7.18 billion. Of this
amount, we expect to recognize $4.51 billion in the next 12 months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period.
We have financing receivables on our consolidated balance sheets related to loans we provide for financing our energy products. As of
December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had current net financing receivables of $34 million and $31 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net, and
$658 million and $578 million, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion.
Energy Generation and Storage Leasing
For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease agreements for energy generation and storage products, we record lease
revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the
lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference between the payments received and the revenue recognized is
recorded as deferred revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet.
For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs prior to January 1, 2019, we have determined that these
agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840, Leases. Revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity
delivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.
We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized,
which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, deferred revenue related to such
customer payments amounted to $164 million and $181 million, respectively. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and incentives
received from utility companies and various local and state government agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. As of
December 31, 2024 and 2023, deferred revenue from rebates and incentives was immaterial.
57

--- Page 62 ---

We capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs, which include the referral fees and sales
commissions, as an element of solar energy systems, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related agreements.
Cost of Revenues
Automotive Segment
Automotive Sales
Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct and indirect materials, labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling
and machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, FSD (Supervised) ongoing maintenance costs, electricity costs for our free
Supercharging programs and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes adjustments to warranty
expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and
on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of automotive sales revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned, amounting
to $625 million and $359 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Automotive Leasing
Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases
and warranty expense related to leased vehicles.
Services and Other
Costs of services and other revenue includes cost of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs associated with providing non-warranty
after-sales services, costs associated with our body shops and part sales, costs of paid Supercharging, costs to provide vehicle insurance and costs of
retail merchandise sales.
Energy Generation and Storage Segment
Energy Generation and Storage
Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including
depreciation costs of tooling and machinery, freight, warranty expense, and cost of servicing. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also
includes charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-
hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally, cost of energy generation and storage revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned,
amounting to $756 million and $115 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In agreements for solar energy systems and
PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs
associated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under
which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities
using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
58

--- Page 63 ---

Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance
recorded against our net deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking
into account all relevant factors at each reporting period. In completing our assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history
of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings,
excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. We
also rely on our assessment of the Company’s projected future results of business operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to
historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our
ability to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation
allowance assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all available information.
We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is
more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense.
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries.
Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such
amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and
liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income is comprised of net income and other comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign
currency translation adjustments and unrealized net gains and losses on investments that have been excluded from the determination of net income.
Stock-Based Compensation
We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and RSUs granted to employees and for our ESPP to measure the cost of employee
services received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is
estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the
risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment. The fair value of
RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during
which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is generally four years for stock options
and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of actual forfeitures in the period.
For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual
performance milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable.
As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may
calculate significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based
compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and
development expense and Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests
Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding
arrangements, or funds, that we have entered into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and vehicles under operating leases. We have determined
that the contractual provisions of the funds represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements. We have further determined that the methodology for
calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the substantive profit-sharing arrangements is a
balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. We, therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling
interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the HLBV method, which is presented on
the consolidated balance sheet as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV
method, the amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet represent the
amounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets
of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date and
distributed to the third parties. The third parties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling
interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after
taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least
equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the
consolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets.
Net Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders
Basic net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common
stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-
average shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method or
the if-converted method, as applicable, are included when calculating diluted net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders
when their effect is dilutive.
The following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to net income used in computing basic and
diluted net income per share of common stock (in millions):

Cash and Cash Equivalents
All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents.
Restricted Cash
We maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use. Our restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash held to service certain
payments under various secured debt facilities, cash held as collateral for sales to lease partners with a resale value guarantee and deposits held for our
insurance services. We record restricted cash as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and determine current or non-current classification
based on the expected duration of the restriction.
Our total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows, was as follows (in millions):
December 31, December 31, December 31,
2024 2023 2022
Cash and cash equivalents $ 16,139 $ 16,398 $ 16,253

Total as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows $ 17,037 $ 17,189 $ 16,924
Investments
Our investments are all designated as available-for-sale and reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive loss which is included within stockholders’ equity. Available-for-sale marketable securities with maturities greater than
three months at the date of purchase are included in short-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets. Interest, dividends, amortization and
accretion of purchase premiums and discounts on these investments are included within Interest income in our consolidated statements of operations.
Interest income on our short-term investments for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $763 million, $388 million and an immaterial
amount, respectively.

The cost of available-for-sale investments sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-
sale investments are recorded in Other income (expense), net.
We regularly review all of our investments for declines in fair value. The review includes but is not limited to (i) the consideration of the cause of the
decline, (ii) any currently recorded expected credit losses and (iii) the creditworthiness of the respective security issuers. The amortized cost basis of our
investments approximates its fair value.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing
products to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and
government rebates already passed through to customers. We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the amount we expect to be
uncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.
Depending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for
certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to
approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with sales of energy
storage products are dependent on billing milestones and payment terms negotiated for each contract, and our accounts receivable balances associated
with our sales of regulatory credits are dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be
collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact
on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, government rebates receivable was $315 million and $378
million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net for the current portion and an immaterial amount and $207 million, respectively, in Other non-current
assets for the long-term portion in our consolidated balance sheets.
Financing Receivables
We provide financing options to our customers for our automotive and energy products. Financing receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of
allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels
considered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the financing receivables. In determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level
of credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows. Interest income
on financing receivables is recognized over the loan term as revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.
When originating consumer receivables, we review the credit application, the proposed contract terms, credit bureau information (e.g., FICO score)
and other information. Our evaluation emphasizes the applicant’s ability to pay and creditworthiness focusing on payment, affordability, and applicant
credit history as key considerations. Generally, all customers in this portfolio have strong creditworthiness at loan origination.
After origination, we review the credit quality of retail financing based on customer payment activity and aging analysis. For all financing
receivables, we define “past due” as any payment, including principal and interest, which is at least 31 days past the contractual due date. As of
December 31, 2024 and 2023, the vast majority of our financing receivables were at current status with an immaterial balance being past due. As of
December 31, 2024 and 2023, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2023 and 2022.
We have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which provided residential customers with the option to finance the
purchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan and were all originated prior to year 2018. The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for
expected credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current
portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total outstanding balance of MyPower
customer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $248 million and $266 million, respectively, of which $4 million and $5 million
were due in the next 12 months as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for expected credit
losses was $33 million and $36 million, respectively.

Concentration of Risk
Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash,
accounts receivable and other finance receivables. Our cash and investments balances are primarily on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions
or invested in highly rated, investment-grade securities. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, no
entity represented 10% or more of our total receivables balance.
Supply Risk
We are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our
products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these
suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
Inventory Valuation
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which
approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about
current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.
We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory.
This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product.
Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result
in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.
Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small
change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.
Operating Lease Vehicles
Vehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less accumulated
depreciation. We generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the straight-line-method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the
contractual period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $7.03 billion and $7.36 billion, respectively.
Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $1.45 billion and $1.38 billion as of
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Digital Assets, Net
We account for all digital assets held as crypto assets, a subset of indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350-60, Intangibles -
Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets. We have ownership of and control over our digital assets and we may use third-party custodial services to secure it.
The digital assets are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently remeasured on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. Periods prior to January
1, 2024 include digital assets at cost, net of impairment losses incurred since their acquisition.
We determine and record the fair value of our digital assets in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (“ASC 820”), based on quoted
prices on the active exchange(s) that we have determined is the principal market for such assets (Level I inputs). We determine the cost basis of our
digital assets using the specific identification of each unit received. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are now recorded to Other income
(expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations.
63

--- Page 68 ---

For periods prior to January 1, 2024, impairment losses were recognized within Restructuring and other in the consolidated statements of operations
in the period in which the impairment was identified. Also for periods prior to January 1, 2024, gains were not recorded until realized upon sale(s), at
which point they were presented net of any impairment losses for the same digital assets held within Restructuring and other. In determining the gain to
be recognized upon sale, we calculate the difference between the sales price and carrying value of the digital assets sold immediately prior to sale.
See Note 3, Digital Assets, Net, for further information regarding digital assets.
Solar Energy Systems, Net
We are the lessor of solar energy systems, which are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of solar energy systems is
calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of 30 to 35 years. The gross cost of solar energy systems as of December 31,
2024 and 2023 was $6.79 billion and $6.87 billion, respectively. Solar energy systems on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of
accumulated depreciation of $1.86 billion and $1.64 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Property, Plant and Equipment, Net
Property, plant and equipment, net, including leasehold improvements, are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is
generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:
Machinery, equipment, vehicles and office furniture 3 to 15 years
Tooling 4 to 7 years
Building and building improvements 15 to 30 years
Computer equipment and software 3 to 6 years
AI infrastructure 5 to 30 years
Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. AI infrastructure includes our owned data centers.
Upon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the
consolidated balance sheet, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operations. Maintenance and repair expenditures
are expensed as incurred while major improvements that increase the functionality, output or expected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated
ratably over the identified useful life.
Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets
We review our property, plant and equipment, solar energy systems, long-term prepayments and intangible assets for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability by
comparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If the asset is not recoverable, its carrying
amount would be adjusted down to its fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we have recognized no material impairments
of our long-lived assets.
Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from seven to thirty years.
Goodwill
We assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be
impaired, by comparing its carrying value to the reporting unit’s fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we did not
recognize any impairment of goodwill.

Capitalization of Software Costs
We capitalize costs incurred in the development of internal use software, during the application development stage to Property, plant and
equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as
incurred. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of three to five years.
Software development costs incurred in development of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed, incurred subsequent to the
establishment of technological feasibility and prior to the general availability of the software are capitalized when they are expected to become
significant. Such costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable software once it is made generally available to our customers.
We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis, and we test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur
that could impact the recoverability of these assets. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we have recognized no impairments of
capitalized software costs.
Foreign Currency
We determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary
currency in which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by
the different rates we apply to current period income or loss and the balance sheet. For each subsidiary, we apply the monthly average functional
exchange rate to its monthly income or loss and the month-end functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other
than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in Other income (expense), net, in the consolidated
statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded a net foreign currency transaction gain of $57 million,
gain of $122 million and loss of $89 million, respectively.
Warranties
We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation
and storage systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our
best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims
incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our
historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include
projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs,
as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12
months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets. For liabilities that we are entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables for the contractually obligated
amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-
current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.
Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment.Accrued warranty activity
consisted of the following (in millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2024 2023 2022
Accrued warranty—beginning of period $ 5,152 $ 3,505 $ 2,101

Customer Deposits
Customer deposits primarily consist of refundable cash payments from customers at the time they place an order or reservation for a vehicle or an
energy product and any additional payments up to the point of delivery or the completion of installation. Customer deposits also include prepayments on
contracts that can be cancelled without significant penalties, such as vehicle maintenance plans. Customer deposits are included in Accrued liabilities and
other on the consolidated balance sheets until refunded, forfeited or applied towards the customer’s purchase balance.
Government Assistance Programs and Incentives
Globally, the operation of our business is impacted by various government programs, incentives, and other arrangements. Government incentives
are recorded in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with their purpose as a reduction of expense, or an offset to the related capital asset.
The benefit is generally recorded when all conditions attached to the incentive have been met or are expected to be met and there is reasonable
assurance of their receipt.
The IRA Incentives
On August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted into law and is effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA includes multiple
incentives to promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture or purchase, in addition to a new corporate alternative
minimum tax of 15% on adjusted financial statement income of corporations with profits greater than $1 billion. Some of these measures are expected to
materially affect our consolidated financial statements. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the impact from our IRA incentive was
primarily a reduction of our costs of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.
Gigafactory New York—New York State Investment and Lease
We have a lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related
research and development agreement, we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the facility. We are required to comply with certain covenants,
including hiring and cumulative investment targets. Under the terms of the arrangement, the SUNY Foundation paid for a majority of the construction
costs related to the manufacturing facility and the acquisition and commissioning of certain manufacturing equipment; and we are responsible for any
construction or equipment costs in excess of such amount (refer to Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies). This incentive reduces the related lease
costs of the facility within the Energy generation and storage cost of revenues and operating expense line items in our consolidated statements of
operations and was not material for any period presented.
Gigafactory Shanghai—Land Use Rights and Economic Benefits
We have an agreement with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights at Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we
are required to meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target starting at the end of 2023. In addition, the Shanghai
government has granted to our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary certain incentives to be used in connection with eligible capital investments at
Gigafactory Shanghai (refer to Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies). Incentives that offset costs of our facilities are recorded as a reduction of the
cost of the capital investment within the Property, plant and equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets and incentives related to our
manufacturing operations are recorded as an offset to cost of revenues in our consolidated statements of operations. For the years ended December 31,
2024 and 2023, the amounts received were immaterial.
Nevada Tax Incentives
In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we entered into agreements in 2014 with the State of Nevada and Storey County in
Nevada that provide abatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits of up to $195 million in
consideration of capital investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada.

Gigafactory Texas Tax Incentives
In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas, we entered into a 20-year agreement in 2020 with Travis County in Texas pursuant to
which we would receive grant funding equal to 70-80% of property taxes paid by us to Travis County and a separate 10-year agreement in 2020 with the
Del Valle Independent School District in Texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our property would be capped at a specified amount, in
each case subject to our meeting certain minimum economic development metrics through our construction and operations at Gigafactory Texas. This
incentive is recorded as a reduction of the related expenses within the Cost of automotive revenues and operating expense line items of our consolidated
statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the grant funding related to property taxes paid were immaterial.
Defined Contribution Plan
We have a 401(k) savings plan in the U.S. that is intended to qualify as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue
Code and a number of savings plans internationally. Under the 401(k) savings plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 90% of their
eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. Beginning in January 2022, we began to match 50% of each employee’s contributions up to a
maximum of 6% (capped at $3,000) of the employee’s eligible compensation, vested upon one year of service. During the years ended December 31,
2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $107 million, $99 million and $91 million, respectively, of expenses related to employer contributions for the 401(k)
savings plan.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-09, Improvements to
Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as
additional information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early
adoption is also permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. This ASU will likely result in the
required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements, once adopted.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (Subtopic 220-40). The ASU requires the
disaggregated disclosure of specific expense categories, including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and amortization, within
relevant income statement captions. This ASU also requires disclosure of the total amount of selling expenses along with the definition of selling
expenses. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2027. Adoption of this ASU can either be applied prospectively to consolidated financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective
date of this ASU or retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted. This ASU
will likely result in the required additional disclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements, once adopted. We are currently evaluating
the provisions of this ASU.
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280). This ASU updates reportable
segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating
Decision Maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of a segment's profit or loss. This ASU also requires disclosure of the title and
position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment’s profit or loss in
assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and
interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We adopted this ASU retrospectively on December 31, 2024. Refer to Note 17,
Segment Reporting and Information about Geographic Areas for the inclusion of the new required disclosures.

ASU 2023-08
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60) (“new crypto assets
standard”). The new crypto assets standard requires certain crypto assets to be measured at fair value separately on the balance sheet with changes
reported in the statement of operations each reporting period. The new crypto assets standard also enhances the other intangible asset disclosure
requirements by requiring the name, cost basis, fair value, and number of units for each significant crypto asset holding. The new crypto assets standard
is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the new crypto assets
standard requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of the annual reporting period in which
an entity adopts the amendments. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period. However, if the new crypto assets standard is
early adopted in an interim period, an entity must adopt the new crypto assets standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim
period. We adopted the new crypto assets standard on a modified retrospective approach effective January 1, 2024. Refer to Note 3, Digital Assets, Net
for the inclusion of the new required disclosures. The cumulative effect of the changes made on our January 1, 2024 consolidated balance sheet for the
adoption of the new crypto assets standard was as follows (in millions):

The net carrying value of our intangible assets decreased from $178 million as of December 31, 2023 to $150 million as of December 31, 2024
mainly from amortization.
Note 5 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments
ASC 820 states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in
measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in
active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value
hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value. Our assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value
on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions):

All of our money market funds and digital assets are classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using quoted
prices in active markets. Our U.S. government securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, time deposits and corporate debt securities are
classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy and the market approach was used to determine fair value of these investments.
Our cash, cash equivalents and investments classified by security type as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 consisted of the following (in millions):

Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to our general assets. Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets of our
subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net carrying values are due to debt discounts or deferred issuance costs. As
of December 31, 2024, we were in material compliance with all financial debt covenants.
2024 Notes
During the second quarter of 2024, the 2024 Notes reached maturity and were fully settled. Additionally, in 2024, we fully settled the warrants
entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, resulting in the issuance of 11.4 million shares of our common stock.
Credit Agreement
In January 2023, we entered into a 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “RCF Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks. The RCF
Credit Agreement contains two optional one-year extensions and has a total commitment of up to $5.00 billion, which could be increased up to $7.00
billion under certain circumstances. The underlying borrowings may be used for general corporate purposes. Borrowed funds accrue interest at a variable
rate equal to: (i) for dollar-denominated loans, at our election, (a) Term SOFR (the forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus 0.10%, or (b) an
alternate base rate; (ii) for loans denominated in pounds sterling, SONIA (the sterling overnight index average reference rate); or (iii) for loans
denominated in euros, an adjusted EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate); in each case, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin will be based on
the rating assigned to our senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness (the “Credit Rating”) from time to time. The fee for undrawn amounts is variable
based on the Credit Rating and is currently 0.125% per annum.
Automotive Asset-backed Notes
From time to time, we transfer receivables and/or beneficial interests related to certain vehicles (either leased or financed) into special purpose
entities (“SPEs”) and issue Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive assets to investors. The SPEs are consolidated in the financial
statements. The cash flows generated by these automotive assets are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Automotive Asset-
backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to the owners of the SPEs. We recognize revenue earned from the
associated customer lease or financing contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to
our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Automotive Asset-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets.
In 2024, we transferred beneficial interests related to certain leased vehicles and/or financing receivables into SPEs and issued $2.45 billion in
aggregate principal amount of Automotive Asset-backed Notes, with terms similar to our other previously issued Automotive Asset-backed Notes. The
proceeds from the issuance, net of debt issuance costs, were $2.44 billion.
Energy Asset-backed Notes
In 2024, we transferred certain financing receivables into an SPE and issued $499 million in aggregate principal amount of Energy Asset-backed
Notes, backed by these financing receivables. The proceeds from issuance, net of debt issuance costs, were $494 million. The SPE is wholly owned by us
and is consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these financing receivables are used to service the principal and interest
payments on the Energy Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPE’s expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to us. The SPE’s assets and cash flows
are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPE, including the Energy Asset-backed Notes holders, have no recourse to our other
assets.
Cash Equity Debt
In connection with the cash equity financing deals closed in 2016, our subsidiaries issued $502 million in aggregate principal amount of debt that
bears interest at fixed rates. This debt is secured by, among other things, our interests in certain financing funds and is non-recourse to our other assets.

China Working Capital Facility
In April 2024, one of our subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement (the “China Working Capital Facility”) with lenders in China for an unsecured
revolving facility of up to RMB 20.00 billion to be used for certain production expenditures as well as repayment of certain finance facilities. Borrowed
funds bear interest at a rate equal to the Loan Prime Rate published by the People’s Bank of China minus 1.18%. The China Working Capital Facility is
non-recourse to our assets.
Pledged Assets
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had pledged or restricted $5.16 billion and $4.64 billion of our assets (consisting principally of operating
lease vehicles, financing receivables, restricted cash, and equity interests in certain SPEs) as collateral for our outstanding debt.
Schedule of Principal Maturities of Debt
The future scheduled principal maturities of debt as of December 31, 2024 were as follows (in millions):

Note 11 – Leases
We have entered into various operating and finance lease agreements for certain of our offices, manufacturing and warehouse facilities, retail and
service locations, data centers, equipment, vehicles, and solar energy systems, worldwide. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a
lease, at inception and record the lease in our financial statements upon lease commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made
available for use by the lessor.
We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and have elected to utilize the practical expedient to account for lease and non-
lease components together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor perspective with the exception of direct sales-type
leases and production equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. From a lessor perspective, the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for
the non-lease components and associated lease component and, the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating
lease.
We have elected not to present short-term leases on the consolidated balance sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease
inception and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably certain to exercise. All other lease assets and lease liabilities are
recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Because most of our leases do not provide an
implicit rate of return, we used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease commencement date in determining the
present value of lease payments.
Our leases, where we are the lessee, often include options to extend the lease term for up to 10 years. Some of our leases also include options to
terminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, lease terms include options to extend or
terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.

Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending
on the nature of the leased asset. Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate. We calculate the
present value of future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date for new leases. Differences between the calculated
lease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred. Amortization of finance lease assets is recognized over the lease term as cost of revenues
or operating expenses depending on the nature of the leased asset. Interest expense on finance lease liabilities is recognized over the lease term within
Interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

The above table does not include vehicle sales to customers or leasing partners with a resale value guarantee as the cash payments were received
upfront. For our solar PPA arrangements, customers are charged solely based on actual power produced by the installed solar energy system at a
predefined rate per kilowatt-hour of power produced. The future payments from such arrangements are not included in the above table as they are a
function of the power generated by the related solar energy systems in the future.

Note 12 – Equity Incentive Plans
In June 2019, we adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”). The 2019 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock,
RSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance units and performance shares to our employees, directors and consultants. Stock options granted under the
2019 Plan may be either incentive stock options or nonstatutory stock options. Incentive stock options may only be granted to our employees.
Nonstatutory stock options may be granted to our employees, directors and consultants. Generally, our stock options and RSUs vest over four years and
our stock options are exercisable over a maximum period of 10 years from their grant dates. Vesting typically terminates when the employment or
consulting relationship ends.
As of December 31, 2024, 113.0 million shares were reserved and available for issuance under the 2019 Plan.

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $1.77 billion, $1.33 billion and
$1.90 billion, respectively.
ESPP
Our employees are eligible to purchase our common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15% of their eligible compensation, subject to any
plan limitations. The purchase price would be 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first and last trading days of each six-month offering
period. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, under the ESPP we issued 2.2 million, 2.1 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively.
As of December 31, 2024, there were 95.5 million shares available for issuance under the ESPP.
Fair Value Assumptions
We use the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. Under the fair value method, we estimate the fair value of each
stock option award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model. The weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock options are as follows:
Year Ended December 31,
2024 2023 2022
Risk-free interest rate 3.92 % 3.90 % 3.11 %
Expected term (in years) 4.3 4.5 4.1
Expected volatility 59 % 63 % 63 %
Dividend yield 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 %
Grant date fair value per share $ 114.29 $ 121.62 $ 114.51
The fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of
our common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximating each
grant’s expected life. We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the average
of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical volatility of our common stock.

Other Performance-Based Grants
From time to time, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors grants certain employees performance-based RSUs and stock options.
As of December 31, 2024, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $490 million under these grants to purchase or receive an
aggregate 5.0 million shares of our common stock. For awards probable of achievement, we estimate the unrecognized stock-based compensation
expense of $421 million will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 4.0 years.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, stock-based compensation expense related to these grants, net of forfeitures, were not
material.

As of December 31, 2024, we maintained valuation allowances of $1.22 billion for deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be
realized, which primarily included our California deferred tax assets, U.S. foreign tax credits and certain foreign operating losses. The valuation allowance
on our net deferred tax assets increased by $332 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, and decreased by $6.46 billion and $1.73 billion
during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The valuation allowance increase during the year ended December 31, 2024 was
primarily due to the changes of our California deferred tax assets, U.S. foreign tax credits and certain foreign operating losses. The change in valuation
allowance during the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the release of our valuation allowance with respect to our U.S. federal and
certain state deferred tax assets. In the fourth quarter of 2023, based on the relevant weight of positive and negative evidence, including the amount of
our taxable income in recent years which was objective and verifiable, and consideration of our expected future taxable earnings, we concluded that it is
more likely than not that most of our U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets are realizable and released the valuation allowance on these
deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance change during the years ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to changes in our U.S. deferred tax
assets and liabilities. Our deferred tax assets without a valuation allowance are more likely than not to be realized given the expectation of future
earnings in the respective jurisdictions.
As of December 31, 2024, we had $4.34 billion of federal and $8.59 billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future
taxable income, an immaterial amount of which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2026 for federal and 2025 for state purposes. Federal and state laws
can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an “ownership change,” as defined
in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss
and tax credit carry-forwards due to prior ownership changes or expirations.
As of December 31, 2024, we had federal research and development tax credits of $1.48 billion, federal renewable energy tax credits of $1.01
billion, and state research and development tax credits of $1.06 billion. Most of our state research and development tax credits were in the state of
California. If not utilized, some of the federal tax credits may expire in various amounts beginning in 2035. However, California research and development
tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely.
As of December 31, 2024, we intend to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings and cash unless such repatriation results in no or minimal tax costs.
We have recorded the taxes associated with the foreign earnings we intend to repatriate in the future. For the earnings we intend to indefinitely reinvest,
no deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding or other taxes have been recorded. The estimated amount of such unrecognized withholding tax liability
associated with the indefinitely reinvested earnings is approximately $309 million.

We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. We recognized net interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits in provision for (benefit from) income taxes line of our consolidated statements of operations of $23 million, $17 million and
$27 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, we have accrued $69 million and
$47 million, respectively, related to interest and penalties on our unrecognized tax benefits. Unrecognized tax benefits of $1.14 billion, if recognized,
would affect our effective tax rate.
We file income tax returns in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) for the years 2015 to 2018. Additional tax years within the periods 2004 to 2014 and 2019 to 2023 remain subject to examination for
federal income tax purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for U.S. federal and state income tax
purposes. Our returns for 2004 and subsequent tax years remain subject to examination in U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.
Given the uncertainty in timing and outcome of our tax examinations, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change in gross
unrecognized tax benefits within twelve months cannot be made at this time.
Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies
Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York
We have an operating lease arrangement through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under
the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the facility.
Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in
the State of New York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other
costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each
anniversary of such date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, it may result in our incurring financial liabilities in
the form of “program payments” which would not be expected to have a material adverse effect to our financial operations, the termination of our lease
at Gigafactory New York, and/or the need to adjust certain of our operations.
In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses,
costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. As of December 31, 2024, we have met and expect to meet the
requirements under this arrangement, as may be modified and discussed from time to time, based on our current and anticipated level of operations.
Operating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai, China
We have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of 50 years with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights where we have
been constructing Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to spend RMB 14.08 billion in capital expenditures by the
end of 2023, which was achieved in 2023, and to generate RMB 2.23 billion of annual tax revenues starting at the end of 2023. As of December 31, 2024
and 2023, we had met and expect to meet the tax revenue requirements based on our current level of spend and sales.

Legal Proceedings
Litigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award
On June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Elon Musk and
the members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted, alleging corporate waste, unjust enrichment and that such board members breached their
fiduciary duties by approving the stock-based compensation plan awarded to Elon Musk in 2018 (the “2018 CEO Performance Award”). Trial was held
November 14-18, 2022. On January 30, 2024, the Court issued an opinion finding that the 2018 CEO Performance Award should be rescinded. Plaintiff’s
counsel filed a brief seeking a fee award of 29,402,900 Tesla shares, plus expenses of $1,120,115.50. Tesla opposed the fee request, and at Tesla’s 2024
Annual Meeting of Stockholders, 72% of the disinterested voting shares of Tesla, excluding shares owned by Mr. Musk and Kimbal Musk, voted to ratify
the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Because Tesla’s disinterested stockholders voted to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award, Mr. Musk and the other
director defendants, joined by Tesla, filed a brief seeking to revise the Court’s January 30, 2024 opinion. On December 2, 2024, the Court issued an
opinion denying the motion to revise the Court’s January 30, 2024 opinion and awarded Plaintiff’s counsel fees in the amount of $345 million. A final
judgment was entered by the Court, and the director defendants and Tesla appealed the decisions to the Delaware Supreme Court.
Litigation Related to Directors’ Compensation
On June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against
certain of Tesla’s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to Tesla’s directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and
2020. The suit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages and
other relief. Defendants filed their answer on September 17, 2020.
On July 14, 2023, the parties filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement, which does not involve an admission of any
wrongdoing by any party. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Tesla provided notice of the proposed settlement to stockholders of record as of July
14, 2023. The Court held a hearing regarding the settlement on October 13, 2023, after which it took the settlement and plaintiff counsels’ fee request
under advisement. On January 8, 2025, the Court approved the settlement and awarded Plaintiff’s counsel fees in the amount of approximately
$176 million. A final judgment was entered by the Court on January 13, 2025. Tesla intends to appeal the Court’s fee award on or before the appeal
deadline of February 12, 2025. The settlement is not expected to have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
Litigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction
Between August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection
with Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. On January 16, 2019, Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and added as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors. The
consolidated complaint asserts claims for violations of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified damages and other relief. The parties stipulated
to certification of a class of stockholders, which the court granted on November 25, 2020. Trial started on January 17, 2023, and on February 3, 2023, a
jury rendered a verdict in favor of the defendants on all counts. After trial, plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law and a motion for new
trial, which the Court denied and judgement was entered in favor of defendants on July 11, 2023. On November 6, 2024, the United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s dismissal of all claims.
Between October 17, 2018 and March 8, 2021, seven derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of
Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of Tesla’s board of directors, as constituted at relevant times, in relation to statements made and actions
connected to a potential going private transaction, with certain of the lawsuits challenging additional Twitter posts by Mr. Musk, among other things.
Several of those actions were consolidated, and all have been stayed. In addition to these cases, two derivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018
and February 11, 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of the
Tesla board of directors as then constituted. Those cases have also been consolidated and stayed.

--- Page 90 ---

On October 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a purported shareholder of Tesla alleging, among other things, that
board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of the Company’s 2018 settlement with the SEC, as amended. Among
other things, the plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company’s corporate governance and internal procedures, unspecified damages, and attorneys’ fees. The
lawsuit has been stayed pending resolution of a motion to consolidate certain derivative lawsuits in the Delaware Court of Chancery referenced below.
On November 15, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank filed a lawsuit against Tesla in the Southern District of New York alleging breach of a stock warrant
agreement that was entered into as part of a convertible notes offering in 2014. Tesla denied any wrongdoing and filed multiple counterclaims. On
November 27, 2024, the parties agreed to settle their claims.
Certain Derivative Lawsuits in Delaware
Before converting from a Delaware to Texas corporation on June 13, 2024, three separate derivative actions brought by purported Tesla
stockholders were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery on May 24, June 10 and June 13, 2024, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against current and
former directors regarding topics involving Elon Musk and others, X Corp. (formerly Twitter) and x.AI. These suits assert various claims, including breach
of fiduciary duty and breach of contract, and seek unspecified damages and other relief. On August 6, 2024, the plaintiffs in these three actions moved to
consolidate the matters into a single case. The Court consolidated two of the three cases.
Litigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment
On February 9, 2022, the California Civil Rights Department (“CRD,” formerly “DFEH”) filed a civil complaint against Tesla in Alameda County,
California Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile work environment and pay equity claims, among others. CRD’s amended
complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. The case is currently in discovery. Trial is scheduled for September 15, 2025.
Additionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) issued a cause finding against Tesla that closely parallels the
CRD’s allegations. On September 28, 2023, the EEOC filed a civil complaint against Tesla in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California asserting claims for race harassment and retaliation and seeking, among other things, monetary and injunctive relief.
On June 16, 2022, two Tesla stockholders filed separate derivative actions in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, purportedly on
behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla’s current and former directors. Both suits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and
violation of the federal securities laws in connection with alleged race and gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Among other things, plaintiffs
seek declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages payable to Tesla, and attorneys’ fees. On July 22, 2022, the Court consolidated the two cases
and on September 6, 2022, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. On November 7, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case and on
September 15, 2023, the Court dismissed the action but granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint. On November 2, 2023, plaintiff filed an
amended complaint purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Elon Musk. On December 19, 2023, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint,
which the Court granted on April 12, 2024, with leave for plaintiffs to amend. On May 15, 2024, plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated complaint
purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk. On July 1, 2024, the defendants moved to dismiss the second amended consolidated complaint.

Other Litigation Related to Our Products and Services
We are also subject to various lawsuits that seek monetary and other injunctive relief. These lawsuits include proposed class actions and other
consumer claims that allege, among other things, purported defects and misrepresentations related to our products and services. For example, on
September 14, 2022, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. and related entities in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California, alleging various claims about the Company’s driver assistance technology systems under state and federal law. This case was later
consolidated with several other proposed class actions, and a Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed on October 28, 2022, which seeks damages and
other relief on behalf of all persons who purchased or leased from Tesla between January 1, 2016, to the present. On October 5, 2022, a proposed class
action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting similar state and federal law claims against the same
defendants. On September 30, 2023, the Court dismissed this action with leave to amend the complaint. On November 20, 2023, the plaintiff moved to
amend the complaint, which Tesla opposed. On August 8, 2024, the Court denied the plaintiff’s motion for leave to file an amended complaint and entered
judgment for Tesla. On September 5, 2024, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the parties
are briefing the matter. On March 22, 2023, the plaintiffs in the Northern District of California consolidated action filed a motion for a preliminary
injunction to order Tesla to (1) cease using the term “Full Self-Driving Capability” (FSD Capability), (2) cease the sale and activation of FSD Capability and
deactivate FSD Capability on Tesla vehicles, and (3) provide certain notices to consumers about proposed court-findings about the accuracy of the use of
the terms Autopilot and FSD Capability. Tesla opposed the motion. On September 30, 2023, the Court denied the request for a preliminary injunction,
compelled four of five plaintiffs to arbitration, and dismissed the claims of the fifth plaintiff with leave to amend the complaint. On October 31, 2023, the
remaining plaintiff in the Northern District of California action filed an amended complaint, which Tesla moved to dismiss, and on May 15, 2024, the Court
granted in part and denied in part Tesla’s motion. On October 2, 2023, a similar proposed class action was filed in San Diego County Superior Court in
California. Tesla subsequently removed the San Diego County case to federal court and on January 8, 2024, the federal court granted Tesla’s motion to
transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Tesla moved to compel arbitration, which the plaintiff did not oppose, and
on June 27, 2024, the Court stayed the case pending arbitration.
On February 27, 2023, a proposed class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, Inc., Elon Musk
and certain current and former Company executives. The complaint alleges that the defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions about
the Company’s Autopilot and FSD Capability technologies and seeks money damages and other relief on behalf of persons who purchased Tesla stock
between February 19, 2019, and February 17, 2023. An amended complaint was filed on September 5, 2023, naming only Tesla, Inc. and Elon Musk as
defendants. On November 6, 2023, Tesla moved to dismiss the amended complaint. On September 30, 2024, the Court granted Tesla’s motion to dismiss
without prejudice. On November 26, 2024, the court issued a final judgment in Tesla’s favor, and on December 23, 2024, the plaintiffs filed a notice of
appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
On March 14, 2023, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Several
similar complaints were also filed in the same court and these cases have now all been consolidated. These complaints allege that Tesla violates federal
antitrust and warranty laws through its repair, service, and maintenance practices and seeks, among other relief, damages for persons who paid Tesla for
repairs services or Tesla compatible replacement parts from March 2019 to March 2023. On July 17, 2023, these plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended
complaint. On September 27, 2023, the court granted Tesla’s motion to compel arbitration as to three of the plaintiffs, and on November 17, 2023, the
court granted Tesla’s motion to dismiss without prejudice. The plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Second Amended Complaint on December 12, 2023, which
Tesla moved to dismiss. Plaintiffs also appealed the court’s arbitration order, which was denied. On June 17, 2024, the Court granted in part and denied in
part Tesla’s motion to dismiss the Consolidated Second Amended Complaint.
The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these matters; however, we cannot predict the outcome or impact. We are unable to reasonably
estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims, unless noted.

Certain Investigations and Other Matters
We regularly receive requests for information, including subpoenas, from regulators and governmental authorities such as the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Department of Justice
(“DOJ”), and various local, state, federal, and international agencies. The ongoing requests for information include topics such as operations, technology
(e.g., vehicle functionality, vehicle incidents, Autopilot and FSD Capability), compliance, finance, data privacy, and other matters related to Tesla’s
business, its personnel, and related parties. We routinely cooperate with such formal and informal requests for information, investigations, and other
inquiries. To our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. We cannot predict the
outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material
adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.
We are also subject to various other legal proceedings, risks and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. For example, during
the second quarter of 2023, a foreign news outlet reported that it obtained certain misappropriated data including, purportedly non-public Tesla business
and personal information. Tesla has made notifications to potentially affected individuals (current and former employees) and regulatory authorities and
we are working with certain law enforcement and other authorities. On August 5, 2023, a putative class action was filed in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of California, purportedly on behalf of all U.S. individuals impacted by the data incident, followed by several additional lawsuits,
that each assert claims under various state laws and seeks monetary damages and other relief. If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur in
these or other possible legal proceedings, risks and claims, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations,
prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.
Letters of Credit

Note 15 – Variable Interest Entity Arrangements
We have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy systems and vehicles. In
particular, our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and contributed cash and assets into various financing funds and entered into
related agreements. We have determined that the funds are VIEs and we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits
criterion under ASC 810. We have considered the provisions within the agreements, which grant us the power to manage and make decisions that affect
the operation of these VIEs, including determining the solar energy systems and the associated customer contracts to be sold or contributed to these
VIEs, redeploying solar energy systems and managing customer receivables. We consider that the rights granted to the fund investors under the
agreements are more protective in nature rather than participating.
As the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of
these VIEs, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Cash
distributions of income and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses, estimated expenses, tax benefits and detriments of income and loss
and tax credits, are allocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as specified in the agreements.
Generally, our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investor’s interest in the fund for an amount based on the market value of the fund or
the formula specified in the agreements.
Upon the sale or liquidation of a fund, distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements.
Pursuant to management services, maintenance and warranty arrangements, we have been contracted to provide services to the funds, such as
operations and maintenance support, accounting, lease servicing and performance reporting. In some instances, we have guaranteed payments to the
fund investors as specified in the agreements. A fund’s creditors have no recourse to our general credit or to that of other funds. Certain assets of the
funds have been pledged as collateral for their obligations.
