The Ambitions That Drive Us
To achieve our vision, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions:
• Reinvent productivity and business processes.
• Build the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge platform.
• Create more personal computing.
Reinvent Productivity and Business Processes
At Microsoft, we provide technology and resources to help our customers create a secure, productive work environment.
Our family of products plays a key role in the ways the world works, learns, and connects.
Our growth depends on securely delivering continuous innovation and advancing our leading productivity and collaboration
tools and services, including Microsoft 365, LinkedIn, and Dynamics 365. Microsoft 365 is an AI first platform that brings

Build the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge Platform
Digital transformation and adoption of AI continues to revolutionize more business workstreams for organizations in every
sector across the globe. For enterprises, digital technology empowers employees, optimizes operations, engages
customers, and in some cases, changes the very core of products and services. We continue to invest in high performance
and sustainable computing to meet the growing demand for fast access to Microsoft services provided by our network of
cloud computing and AI infrastructure and datacenters.
Our cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly
lower cost per unit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and
application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy
locations that lower application maintenance labor costs.
The Microsoft Cloud provides the best integration across the technology stack while offering openness, improving time to
value, reducing costs, and increasing agility. As the foundation of the Microsoft Cloud, Azure uniquely offers hybrid
consistency, developer productivity, data and AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance.
We offer supercomputing power for AI at scale to run large workloads, complemented by our rapidly expanding portfolio of
AI cloud services and hardware, which includes custom-built silicon and strong partnerships with chip manufacturers. We
have introduced purpose-built cloud infrastructure for AI workloads including a custom AI accelerator, Azure Maia, and a
custom in-house central processing unit, Azure Cobalt.
O ur AI platform, Azure AI, is helping organizations transform, bringing intelligence and insights to the hands of their
employees and customers to solve their most pressing challenges. We offer a wide selection of industry-leading frontier
and open models, including from partners, as well as state-of-the-art tooling, and AI-optimized infrastructure, delivering the
Copilot stack for Microsoft, enterprises, and developers. Organizations large and small are deploying Azure AI solutions to
achieve more at scale, more easily, with the proper enterprise-level responsible AI and safety and security protections.

customers integrated products addressing security, compliance, identity, management, and privacy across customers’ multi-
cloud, application, and device assets. With Copilot for Security, Microsoft offers an AI cybersecurity product that enables
security professionals to respond to cyberthreats quickly.
Windows 365 enables users to stream a full Windows experience from the Microsoft Cloud to any device.
Create More Personal Computing
We strive to make computing more personal, enabling users to interact with technology in more intuitive, engaging, and
dynamic ways.
Windows 11 offers innovations focused on performance, productivity, and creativity, including Copilot in Windows. Windows
11 security and privacy features include operating system security, application security, and user and identity security. Dev
Home is an open-source experience in Windows to help developer productivity. We are committed to designing and

digital spend while leading the AI platform wave across our solution areas. We continue to develop complete, intelligent
12

--- Page 14 ---

solutions for our customers that empower people to be productive and collaborate, while safeguarding businesses and
simplifying IT management. Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of technology over the long term, which
we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in:
• Transforming the workplace to deliver new modern, modular business applications, drive deeper insights, and
improve how people communicate, collaborate, learn, work, and interact with one another.
• Building and running cloud-based services in ways that utilize ubiquitous computing to unleash new
experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals.
• Applying AI and ambient intelligence to drive insights, revolutionize many types of work and business
processes, and provide substantive productivity gains using natural methods of communication.
• Tackling security from all angles with our integrated, end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance,
identity, and management, across all clouds and platforms.
• Inventing new gaming experiences that bring people together around their shared love for games on any
devices and pushing the boundaries of innovation with console and PC gaming.
• Using Windows to fuel our cloud business, grow our share of the PC market, and drive increased engagement
with our services like Microsoft Edge, Bing, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 Consumer, Xbox Game Pass, and
more.
Our future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product category definitions, business models, and sales
motions.
Corporate Social Responsibility
Commitment to Sustainability
Microsoft’s approach to addressing climate change starts with the sustainability of our own business. In 2020, we committed
to being a carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste company by 2030.
Since announcing that commitment, we have seen major changes both in the technology sector and in our understanding
of what it will take to meet our climate goals. New technologies, including generative AI, hold promise for new innovations
that can help address the climate crisis. At the same time, the infrastructure and electricity needed for these technologies
create new challenges for meeting sustainability commitments across the tech sector.
In May 2024, we released our Environmental Sustainability Report which looked back at our progress in several areas
during fiscal year 2023. In four areas we are on track, and in each of these we see progress that has the potential to have
global impact beyond our own sustainability work. These are:
• Reducing our direct operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2).
• Accelerating carbon removal.
• Designing for circularity to minimize waste and reusing cloud hardware.
• Improving biodiversity and protecting more land than we use.
At the same time, there are two areas where we’re not yet on track, and in each of these we are intensively engaged in
work to identify and pursue additional breakthroughs. These are:
• Reducing our indirect emissions (Scope 3).
• Reducing our water use and replenishing more water than we consume in our datacenter operations.
Even amid the challenges, we remain optimistic. We’re encouraged by ongoing progress across our campuses and
datacenters, and throughout our value chain.
Addressing Racial Injustice and Inequity
In June 2020, we outlined a series of multi-year commitments designed to address the racial injustice and inequity
experienced by racial and ethnic minorities in the United States, including Black and African American communities. We
13

--- Page 15 ---

remain committed to addressing racial injustice and inequity and helping improve lived experiences at Microsoft, in
employees’ communities, and beyond.
In fiscal year 2024, we continued to collaborate with partners and worked within neighborhoods and communities to advance
projects and programs. We grew our Nonprofit Tech Acceleration for Black and African American Communities program, to
help more than 3,000 local organizations in nearly 1,900 Black and African American communities use technical solutions
to modernize and streamline operations. We also expanded our Technology Education and Learning Support (“TEALS”)
program to reach nearly 550 high schools across 21 racial equity expansion regions with the support of nearly 1,500
volunteers, 12% of whom identify as Black or African American.
We have committed $150 million in Minority Depository Institutions and funds supporting Black and African American-owned
small businesses. These commitments drive sustained impact by directly enabling an increase of funds into local
communities, improving diverse, small-business access to capital, and increasing skill development. We continue to partner
with diverse-owned banking partners and asset managers to catalyze growth and industry participation. Additionally, we
enriched our supplier pipeline, achieving our goal to spend $500 million with double the number of Black- and African
American-owned suppliers. We have also provided 162 low- or no-interest loans to our small to medium-sized partners
through our Partner Capital Fund.
We also continue to make progress toward our overall commitment to double the number of Black and African American
and Hispanic and Latinx leaders in the U.S. by 2025.
Investing in Digital Skills
Microsoft’s Skills for Jobs initiative aims to support a more skills-based labor market, with greater flexibility and accessible
learning paths to develop the right skills needed for the most in-demand jobs. This initiative brings together classes, Career
Essentials Certificates, and other resources from LinkedIn, GitHub, and Microsoft Learn, and is built on data insights drawn
from LinkedIn’s Economic Graph. Our goal was to train and certify 10 million learners by 2025. As of May 2024, we have
surpassed that goal, training and certifying 12.6 million learners. We also launched a campaign in the United States in 2021
to help skill and recruit 250,000 people into the nation’s cybersecurity workforce by 2025, representing half of the country’s
workforce shortage. To that end, we are making curriculum available free of charge to all of the nation’s higher education
institutions, providing training for new and existing faculty, and providing scholarships and supplemental resources to 25,000
students. The cyber skills initiative has expanded to 27 additional countries that show elevated cyberthreat risks coupled
with significant gaps in their cybersecurity workforces, where we’ve partnered with nonprofits and other educational
institutions to train the next generation of cybersecurity workers.
G enerative AI is creating unparalleled opportunities to empower workers globally, but only if everyone has the skills to use
it. In June 2023, we launched an AI Skills initiative to help everyone learn how to harness the power of AI. This includes a
new LinkedIn learning pathway offering new coursework on learning the foundations of generative AI. We also launched a
new global grant challenge to uncover new ways of training workers on generative AI and provide greater access to digital
learning events and resources. Additionally, we extended our reach in rural communities, including through our TechSpark
initiative in the United States. As of June 2024, we’ve helped more than 2.5 million people in 92% of the world’s countries
learn how to use AI.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
Microsoft aims to recruit, develop, and retain world-changing talent from a diversity of backgrounds. To foster their and our
success, we seek to create an environment where people can thrive and do their best work. We strive to maximize the
potential of our human capital resources by creating a respectful, rewarding, and inclusive work environment that enables
our global employees to create products and services that further our mission. Microsoft’s culture is grounded in growth
mindset. This means everyone is on a continuous journey to learn and grow, operating as one company instead of multiple
siloed businesses. Our culture also embeds the security of customers and Microsoft as a priority for every employee and
across all of our organizations.
As of June 30, 2024, we employed approximately 228,000 people on a full-time basis, 126,000 in the U.S. and 102,000
internationally. Of the total employed people, 86,000 were in operations, including product support and consulting services,
datacenter operations, and manufacturing and distribution; 81,000 were in product research and development; 45,000 were
in sales and marketing; and 16,000 were in general and administration. Certain employees are subject to collective
bargaining agreements.
14

--- Page 16 ---

We design our programs to attract, reward, and retain top talent, enable our employees’ continual growth, and reinforce our
culture and values. Our total compensation opportunity is highly differentiated and market competitive. Our intended result
is a global performance and development approach that fosters our culture, drives company performance, and competitive
compensation that ensures equitable pay by role while supporting pay for performance.
Diversity and inclusion are core to our business. As reported in our Global Diversity and Inclusion Reports, we monitor pay
equity and career progress across multiple dimensions. We encourage every person at Microsoft to play an active role in
creating an inclusive environment.
We have invested significantly in employee wellbeing and offer a differentiated benefits package which includes many
physical, emotional, and financial wellness programs. Our Occupational Health and Safety program helps to protect
employees’ safety while they are working. We also have introduced Hybrid Workplace Flexibility guidance to better support
leaders, managers, and employees in hybrid work scenarios.
We believe providing employees with access to continual learning enables them to drive impact for the company. We provide
individuals and teams with access to first and third-party content resources across professions, disciplines, and roles, and
offer skilling opportunities to support employees’ growth while driving organizations’ needs.
Our employee listening systems enable us to gather feedback directly from our workforce to inform our programs and
employee needs globally, giving us real-time insights into ways we can support our employees. As a company, we will
continue to leverage data and research to inform decision making, balancing the needs of the business, team, and individual.
OPERATING SEGMENTS
We operate our business and report our financial performance using three segments: Productivity and Business Processes,
Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view
of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives across the development, sales,
marketing, and services organizations, and they provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within
businesses.

communication and storage through Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive, which is largely driven by subscriptions,
advertising, and the sale of minutes.
LinkedIn
LinkedIn connects the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful and transforms the way
companies hire, market, sell, and learn. Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global
workforce through the ongoing development of the world’s first Economic Graph, a digital representation of the global
economy. In addition to LinkedIn’s free services, LinkedIn offers monetized solutions designed to offer AI-enabled insights
and productivity: Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions. Talent Solutions
provide insights for workforce planning and tools to hire, nurture, and develop talent. Talent Solutions also includes Learning
Solutions, which help businesses close critical skills gaps in times where companies are having to do more with existing
talent. Marketing Solutions help companies reach, engage, and convert their audiences at scale. Premium Subscriptions
enable professionals to manage their professional identity, grow their network, find jobs, access knowledge, and connect
with talent through additional services like premium search. Sales Solutions help companies strengthen customer
relationships, empower teams with digital selling tools, and acquire new opportunities. Growth will depend on our ability to
increase the number of LinkedIn members and our ability to continue offering insight and AI-enabled services that provide
value for our members and increase their engagement. LinkedIn revenue is mainly affected by demand from enterprises
and professionals for subscriptions to Talent Solutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions offerings, as well as
member engagement and the quality of the sponsored content delivered to those members to drive Marketing Solutions.
Dynamics
Dynamics provides cloud-based and on-premises business solutions for financial management, enterprise resource
planning (“ERP”), customer relationship management (“CRM”), and supply chain management, as well as other low code
application development platforms and AI offerings, for small and medium businesses, large organizations, and divisions of
global enterprises. Dynamics revenue is driven by the number of users licensed and applications consumed, expansion of
average revenue per user, and the continued shift to Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent business
applications, including our low code development platforms, such as Power Apps and Power Automate.
Competition
Competitors to Office include software and global application vendors, such as Apple, Cisco Systems, Google, Meta,
Proofpoint, Slack, Symantec, Zoom, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local

create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already have both on-premises or in the
cloud.
LinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and
larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource services; job boards; traditional recruiting
firms; and companies that provide learning and development products and services. Marketing Solutions competes with
online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online
and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights.

Competition
Azure faces diverse competition from companies such as Amazon, Broadcom, Google, IBM, Oracle, and open source
offerings. Azure’s competitive advantage includes enabling a hybrid cloud, allowing deployment of existing datacenters with
our public cloud into a single, cohesive infrastructure, and the ability to run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses
of all sizes and complexities. Our AI offerings compete with AI products from hyperscalers such as Amazon and Google, as
well as products from other emerging competitors, including Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta, and other open source offerings,
many of which are also current or potential partners. Our Azure Security offerings include our cloud security solution and
security information and event management solution, which compete with companies such as Palo Alto Networks and Cisco.
Our Enterprise Mobility + Security offerings also compete with products from a range of competitors including identity
vendors, security solution vendors, and numerous other security point solution vendors. We believe our cloud’s global scale,
17

coupled with our broad portfolio of identity and security solutions, allows us to effectively solve complex cybersecurity
challenges for our customers and differentiates us from the competition.
O ur server products face competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and applications offered by companies
with a range of market approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Oracle
offer their own versions of the Unix operating system preinstalled on server hardware and nearly all computer manufacturers
offer server hardware for the Linux operating system.
We compete to provide enterprise-wide computing and point solutions with numerous commercial software vendors that
offer solutions and middleware technology platforms, software applications for connectivity, security, hosting, database, and
e-business servers. IBM and Oracle lead a group of companies that compete with our enterprise-wide computing solutions.
Commercial competitors for our server applications for PC-based distributed client-server environments include Broadcom,
IBM, and Oracle. Our web application platform software competes with open source software such as Apache, Linux,
MySQL, and PHP. In middleware, we compete against Java vendors.
Our database, business intelligence, and data warehousing solutions offerings compete with products from Databricks, IBM,
Oracle, SAP, Snowflake, and other companies. Our system management solutions compete with server management and
server virtualization platform providers, such as BMC, Broadcom, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM. Our products for software
developers compete against offerings from Adobe, IBM, Oracle, and other companies, and also against open source
projects, including Eclipse (sponsored by IBM, Oracle, and SAP), PHP, and Ruby on Rails.
We believe our server products provide customers with advantages in performance, total costs of ownership, and
productivity by delivering superior applications, development tools, compatibility with a broad base of hardware and software
applications, security, and manageability.
Our Enterprise and Partner Services business competes with a wide range of companies that provide strategy and business
planning, application development, and infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small niche
businesses focused on specific technologies.
More Personal Computing
Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the experience
with our technology. This segment primarily comprises:
• Windows, including Windows OEM licensing and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system;
Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services,
and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; and Windows Internet of Things.
• Devices, including Surface, HoloLens, and PC accessories.
• Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first-party content (such as
Activision Blizzard) and third-party content, including games and in-game content; Xbox Game Pass and other
subscriptions; Xbox Cloud Gaming; advertising; third-party disc royalties; and other cloud services.
• Search and news advertising, comprising Bing (including Copilot), Microsoft News, Microsoft Edge, and third-
party affiliates.
Windows
The Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling
consistency of experience, applications, and information across their devices. Windows OEM revenue is impacted
significantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the devices
they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows OEM revenue is impacted by:
• The mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size.
• Differences in device market demand between developed markets and growth markets.
• Growth of the AI PC category
• Attachment of Windows to devices shipped.
• Customer mix between consumer, small and medium businesses, and large enterprises.
18

--- Page 20 ---

• Changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel.
• Pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts from
local and regional system builders to large multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions
licensed.
• Constraints in the supply chain of device components.
• Piracy.
Windows Commercial revenue, which includes volume licensing of the Windows operating system and Windows cloud
services such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, is affected mainly by the demand from commercial customers for
Microsoft 365 and our advanced security offerings. Windows Commercial revenue often reflects the number of information
workers in a licensed enterprise and is relatively independent of the number of PCs sold in a given year.
Patent licensing includes our programs to license patents we own for use across a broad array of technology areas, including
mobile devices and cloud offerings.
Windows IoT extends the power of Windows and the cloud to intelligent systems by delivering specialized operating
systems, tools, and services for use in embedded devices.
Devices
We design and sell devices, such as Surface (including Copilot+ PCs), HoloLens, and PC accessories. Our devices are
designed to enable people and organizations to connect to the people and content that matter most using Windows and
integrated Microsoft products and services. Surface is designed to help organizations, students, and consumers be more
productive. Growth in Devices is dependent on total PC shipments, the ability to attract new customers, our product
roadmap, and expanding into new categories.
Gaming
Our gaming platform is designed to provide a variety of entertainment through a unique combination of content, community,
and cloud services. Our game content is developed through a collection of first-party studios creating iconic and
differentiated gaming experiences. We continue to invest in new gaming studios and content to expand our intellectual
property roadmap and leverage new content creators. These unique gaming experiences are the cornerstone of Xbox Game
Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a curated library of over 400 first- and third-party console
and PC titles.
The gamer remains at the heart of the Xbox ecosystem. We are identifying new opportunities to attract gamers across a
variety of different end points through our first- and third-party content and business diversification across subscriptions,
ads, and digital stores. We’ve seen new devices from third-party manufacturers along with key PC and mobile end points
that help us empower gamers to play in a way that is most convenient to them. We are focused on growing the platform
and expanding to new ecosystems to engage as many gamers as possible.
Xbox enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences that are accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-
enabled devices, and other devices. Xbox is designed to benefit users by providing access to a network of certified
applications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer
base. Xbox revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of first- and third-party content, as well as advertising.
Growth of our Gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through Xbox enabled content, availability of
games, providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the devices used to
access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences.
S earch and News Advertising
Our Search and news advertising business is designed to deliver relevant search, native, and display advertising to a global
audience. Our Microsoft Edge browser and Bing search engine with Copilot are key tools to enable user acquisition and
engagement, while our technology platform enables accelerated delivery of digital advertising solutions. In addition to first-
party tools, we have several partnerships with companies, such as Yahoo, through which we provide and monetize search
offerings. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant content on
advertising offerings.
19

Competition
Windows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from Apple
and Google, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint competes with CrowdStrike on endpoint security solutions. We believe
Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, and
compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those that enable productivity.
Devices face competition from various computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination of
high-quality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points. These manufacturers, many of which
are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs.
Xbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming
services, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of
entertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from
Nintendo and Sony, both of which have a large, established base of customers. We believe our gaming platform is effectively
positioned against, and uniquely differentiated from, competitive products and services based on significant innovation in
hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong
content from our own first-party game franchises as well as other digital content offerings.
Our Search and news advertising business competes with Google, OpenAI, and a wide array of websites, social platforms
like Meta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users.
OPERATIONS
We have regional operations service centers that support our operations, including customer contract and order processing,
billing, credit and collections, customer lifecycle operations, information processing, and vendor management and logistics.
The centers in Ireland and Romania support the African, European, and Middle East regions; the centers in India and Ireland
support the Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Arlington, Virginia, Atlanta, Georgia, Charlotte, North Carolina, Fargo,
North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Redmond, Washington, Reno, Nevada, and San Jose, Costa Rica support the
Americas regions.
In addition to our operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout each of these regions. We continue to identify
and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs
of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of
permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units
(“GPUs”) and other components.
Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the
ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However,
some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at
these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property
We develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups.
• Cloud and AI – focuses on making IT professionals, developers, partners, independent software vendors, and
their systems more productive and efficient through development of Azure AI platform and cloud infrastructure,
server, database, CRM, ERP, software development tools and services, AI cognitive services, and other
business process applications and services for enterprises.
• Strategic Missions and Technologies – focuses on incubating technical products and support solutions with
transformative potential for the future of cloud computing and continued company growth, such as quantum
computing and advanced AI for science.
• Experiences and Devices – focuses on delivering high value end-user experiences across our products,
services, and devices, including Microsoft 365, Windows, Microsoft Teams, and the Surface line of devices.
20

--- Page 22 ---

• Microsoft AI – focuses on delivering online experiences targeted at consumers (including Bing, Copilot,
Start/MSN, and other advertising-based services) and developing advanced AI models.
• Microsoft Security – focuses on delivering a comprehensive portfolio of services that protect our customers’
digital infrastructure through cloud platform and application security, data protection and governance, identity
and network access, and device management.
• Technology and Research – focuses on fundamental research, product and business incubations, and forward-
looking AI innovations that span infrastructure, services, and applications. This engineering group includes
Microsoft Research, one of the world’s largest corporate research organizations, which focuses on fundamental
research in AI, computer science, and a broad range of other disciplines.
• LinkedIn – focuses on our services that transform the way professionals grow their network and find jobs and
the way businesses hire, market, sell, and learn.
• Gaming – focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help
grow our user base through game experiences and social interaction.
Internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer
technical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and
enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as
possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design. Before
releasing new software platforms, and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms, we provide application
vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also create product
documentation internally.
We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to
ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and hardware
products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and
currently have a portfolio of over 63,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 23,000 pending worldwide. While
we employ much of our internally-developed intellectual property in our products and services, we also engage in outbound
licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ products. From time to time, we enter into
broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We may also
purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services. At times, we make select intellectual
property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards,
advancing interoperability, supporting societal and/or environmental efforts, or attracting and enabling our external
development community. Our engagement with open source software also causes us to license our intellectual property
rights broadly in certain situations.
While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services,
we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially
reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single
license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products.
I nvesting in the Future
Our success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to
initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad adoption
of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer
significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company. Based on our assessment of key
technology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of
technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, AI, devices, and operating
systems.
While our main product research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research
and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world. This global approach helps us remain competitive
in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world.
We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of product research and development activities, and
as appropriate we will coordinate our research and development across operating segments and leverage the results across
the company. This includes continuing to support fundamental research, which provides us with a unique perspective on
future trends and contributes to our innovation.

DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING
We market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs, direct, and distributors and
resellers. Our sales organization performs a variety of functions, including working directly with commercial enterprises and
public-sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology and digital transformation requirements;
managing OEM relationships; and supporting system integrators, independent software vendors, and other partners who
engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products and services.
OEMs
We distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell.
The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell
devices pre-installed with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to
subscribe to Microsoft 365 Consumer.
There are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them is
managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or
more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many
regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC
manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft
distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft.
Direct
Many organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and
Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies,
and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services (“Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors”
or “ESA”). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to
those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales.
We also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and
gaming, through our digital marketplaces and online stores. Additionally, our Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to
facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries.
D istributors and Resellers
Organizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners (“LSP”),
distributors, value-added resellers (“VAR”), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations
of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically
reach small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other
volume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services.
We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators,
resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our
devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit
orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support.
Our Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing
vertical solutions and specialized services.
LICENSING OPTIONS
We offer options for organizations of varying sizes that want to purchase our cloud services and on-premise software. We
license these organizations under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of
products and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. These volume licensing
programs have varying programmatic requirements and benefits to best meet the needs of our customers.
Software Assurance (“SA”) conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract
period. It also provides support, tools, training, and other licensing benefits to help customers deploy and use software
efficiently. SA is required to be purchased with certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others.
22

--- Page 24 ---

Volume Licensing Programs
Enterprise Agreement
Enterprise Agreements offer large organizations a manageable volume licensing program that gives them the flexibility to
buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement. Enterprise Agreements are designed for medium or large
organizations that want to license Microsoft products and services organization-wide over a three-year period. Organizations
can elect to purchase perpetual licenses (covered with SA) and/or subscribe to cloud services.
Microsoft Customer Agreement
Microsoft Customer Agreements are simplified purchase agreements presented, accepted, and stored through a digital
experience. Microsoft Customer Agreements are non-expiring agreements that are designed to support all customers over
time, whether purchasing through a partner or directly from Microsoft.
Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement
Microsoft Online Subscription Agreements are designed for small and medium organizations that want to subscribe to,
activate, provision, and maintain cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web. These agreements allow customers to
acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud-based services.
23

--- Page 25 ---

Microsoft Products and Services Agreement
Microsoft Products and Services Agreements are designed for medium and large organizations that want to license cloud
services and on-premises software as needed, with no organization-wide commitment, under a single, non-expiring
agreement. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is optional for customers that purchase
perpetual licenses.
Open Value
Open Value agreements are a simple, cost-effective way to acquire the latest Microsoft technology. These agreements are
designed for small and medium organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software over a three-
year period. Under Open Value agreements, organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses
and SA is included.
Select Plus
A Select Plus agreement is designed for government and academic organizations to acquire on-premises licenses at any
affiliate or department level, while realizing advantages as one organization. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses
and SA is optional.
Partner Programs
The Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider Program offers customers an easy way to license the cloud services they need in
combination with the value-added services offered by their systems integrator, managed services provider, or cloud reseller
partner. Partners in this program can easily package their own products and services to directly provision, manage, and
support their customer subscriptions.
The Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement allows hosting service providers and independent software vendors
who want to license eligible Microsoft software products to provide hosted applications and software services to their end
customers. Partners license software over a three-year period and are billed monthly based on units licensed.
The Independent Software Vendor Royalty Program enables partners to integrate Microsoft products into other applications
and then license the unified business solution to their end users.
CUSTOMERS
Our customers include individual consumers, small and medium organizations, large global enterprises, public-sector
institutions, Internet service providers, application developers, and OEMs. Our practice is to ship our products promptly
upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
We are subject to a wide range of laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those that
may apply to our products and online services offerings, and those that impose requirements related to user privacy,
telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. How these laws and regulations apply to
our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction. To comply with the accelerating global regulatory obligations, we established a regulatory governance
framework and to create a repeatable system-focused approach to regulatory governance with an initial focus on four
domains: Responsible AI, Privacy, Digital Safety, and Cybersecurity. The framework is designed to help us maintain
customer trust and confidence in our products, remain in compliance with regulators around the globe, and effectively scale
our capability to address the growing number of complex regulations. Through the framework, our legal and regulatory
subject matter experts ingest regulations, develop standards and implementation guidance, and, when appropriate, work
with our engineers to develop and implement products to monitor compliance. Our business teams, with legal support,
manage the compliance programs and prepare external regulatory and commercial reporting, and our internal audit teams
conduct reviews of our programs and processes. While we intended to create a unified approach to regulatory compliance,
some of the programs and processes established pursuant to the framework are tailored to meet specific regulatory
obligations, such as with the creation of independent compliance functions required by the European Union (“EU”) Digital
24

Industry Trends
Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each
industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the
industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and
development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends,
and competitive forces.
Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks
The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are
developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses.
The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in
some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for our software, services,
and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. We must continue
to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.
The investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and
may decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations
and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for
AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking
supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other components. Our devices are primarily
manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other
manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products
contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could
impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.
Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and
industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment,
broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses,
and competitive compensation and benefits.
Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and
expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may
significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not have
a material impact on reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2024.
Refer to Risk Factors in our fiscal year 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of these factors and other risks.
Seasonality
Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Fourth quarter revenue is
driven by a higher volume of multi-year contracts executed during the period.
Change in Accounting Estimate
In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in
software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in
technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four
years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023.

Reportable Segments
We report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent
Cloud, and More Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with
our internal management reporting.
Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of

Metrics
We use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of
resources. We disclose metrics to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide transparency into
performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services. Our commercial and other business
metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and services. The metrics are disclosed in
the MD&A or the Notes to Financial Statements. Financial metrics are calculated based on financial results prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), and growth
comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year.
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, we made updates to the presentation and method of calculation for certain metrics,
revising our Microsoft Cloud revenue metric to include revenue growth and expanding our Microsoft 365 Consumer
subscribers metric to include Microsoft 365 Basic subscribers, aligning with how we manage our business.
Commercial
Our commercial business primarily consists of Server products and cloud services, Office Commercial, Windows
Commercial, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Enterprise and partner services, and Dynamics. Our commercial metrics
allow management and investors to assess the overall health of our commercial business and include leading indicators of
future performance.

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET
The components of other income (expense), net were as follows:
(In millions)
Year Ended June 30, 2024 2023
Interest and dividends income $ 3,157 $ 2,994
Interest expense (2,935) (1,968)
Net recognized gains (losses) on investments (118) 260

We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, interest rates, equity prices, and credit; to
enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of
derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.
F iscal Year 2024 Compared with Fiscal Year 2023
Interest and dividends income increased due to higher yields. Interest expense increased due to the issuance of commercial
paper. Net recognized losses on investments increased primarily due to higher equity impairments and lower gains on
equity investments. Net losses on derivatives decreased primarily due to lower losses on equity derivatives. Other, net
primarily reflects net recognized losses on equity method investments.
INCOME TAXES
Effective Tax Rate
Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 was 18% and 19%, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate
was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes, including the impact from the issuance of Notice 2023-55 and Notice
2023-80 by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and U.S. Treasury Department. Notice 2023-55, issued in the first quarter
of fiscal year 2024, delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft. Notice
2023-80, issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, further delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit
regulations indefinitely.
Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign
jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations
center in Ireland.
The mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result
of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2024, our U.S. income
before income taxes was $62.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $44.9 billion. In fiscal year 2023,
our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) published its model rules “Tax Challenges Arising
From the Digitalisation of the Economy – Global Anti-Base Erosion Model Rules (Pillar Two)” which established a global
minimum corporate tax rate of 15% for certain multinational enterprises. Many countries have implemented or are in the
process of implementing the Pillar Two legislation, which will apply to Microsoft beginning in fiscal year 2025. While we do
not currently estimate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements, we continue to monitor the impact as
countries implement legislation and the OECD provides additional guidance.
Uncertain Tax Positions
We remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on
September 26, 2023, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS. The primary issues in the
NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion
34

--- Page 36 ---

plus penalties and interest. As of June 30, 2024, we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We
disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS’s administrative appeals
office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.
Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax
contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to
examination for tax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of
each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Adjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Prior year non-
GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee severance expenses, impairment
charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. We believe
these non-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify
trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction
with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should
not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial results:
Percentage
(In millions, except percentages and per share amounts) 2024 2023 Change

Adjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) $ 11.80 $ 9.81 20%
* Not meaningful.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital
markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing
activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related
to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments
Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $75.5 billion and $111.3 billion as of June 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. Equity and other investments were $14.6 billion and $9.9 billion as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly
of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The
investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities
to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average
maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income
35

--- Page 37 ---

indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are
primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.
Valuation
In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the
fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government
securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the
quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments,
such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-
backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-
developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using
unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.
A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these
vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying
significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by
our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades.
Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments
based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a
sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair
value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include
model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of
prices where appropriate.
Cash Flows
Cash from operations increased $31.0 billion to $118.5 billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily due to an increase in cash
received from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $6.2 billion to $37.8 billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily due
to a $5.0 billion decrease in common stock repurchases and a $3.3 billion increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net
of repayments, offset in part by a $2.0 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing increased $74.3 billion to
$97.0 billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily due to a $67.5 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of
cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets and a $16.4 billion increase in additions to property and
equipment.
Debt Proceeds
We issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating. The
proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things,
funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt.
Refer to Note 11 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion.
Unearned Revenue
Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include Software
Assurance (“SA”) and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract
period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes
payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the
product or service. Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion.
The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2024:

I f our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-
based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being
recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable. Refer to Note 13 – Unearned Revenue of the
Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion.

Income Taxes
As a result of the TCJA, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject
to U.S. income tax. Under the TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years, with 8% due
in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. As of June 30, 2024, we had a
remaining transition tax liability of $7.6 billion, of which $3.8 billion is short-term and payable in the first quarter of fiscal year
2025.

Share Repurchases
During fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we repurchased 32 million shares and 69 million shares of our common stock for
$12.0 billion and $18.4 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase program. All repurchases were made using cash
resources. As of June 30, 2024, $10.3 billion remained of our $60 billion share repurchase program. Refer to Note 16 –
Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion.
Dividends
During fiscal years 2024 and 2023, our Board of Directors declared dividends totaling $22.3 billion and $20.2 billion,
respectively. We intend to continue returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends, subject to declaration by our
Board of Directors. Refer to Note 16 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion.
Other Planned Uses of Capital
We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of
technology, as well as acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue,
including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support,
and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings
and our investments in AI infrastructure and training. We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate
offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment. We have not engaged
in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to
materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.
RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE
Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing
consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a
significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill,
research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and business combinations – valuation of
intangible assets.
Revenue Recognition
Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining
whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately
versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses
and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted
for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud
services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the
desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from
Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.
Judgment is required to determine the standalone selling price (“SSP”) for each distinct performance obligation. We use a
single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software
updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products
and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the
various products and services.
In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we
determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have
more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers
38

--- Page 40 ---

and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in
determining the SSP.
Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery,
including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.
Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances
we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when
determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at
the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable
consideration were not material for the periods presented.
I mpairment of Investment Securities
We review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value,
we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to
which the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ
a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment
of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business
outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the
security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income
(expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions
deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.
Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment
indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a
qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the
amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other
income (expense), net.
Goodwill
We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We
evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation
approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating
segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would
more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could
include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or
disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.
Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of
assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each
reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow
methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on
internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash
flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.
The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results,
market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination
of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.

Research and Development Costs
Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until
technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs
are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when
technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software
products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this
occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue
over the estimated life of the products.
L egal and Other Contingencies
The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss
from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset
has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining
whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome
and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our
consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current
year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an
entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely
than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the
position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest
benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides
guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities,
accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in
assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax
returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial
statements.
Business Combinations – Valuation of Intangible Assets
Accounting for business combinations requires significant judgments when allocating the purchase price to the estimated
fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Determination of fair value involves estimates
and assumptions which can be complex, most notably with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates used in the
valuation of intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected cash flows, useful lives, and
discount rates. While management’s estimates of fair value are based on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable,
these assumptions are inherently uncertain as they pertain to forward-looking views of our business and market conditions.
The judgments made in this valuation process could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.

STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are
presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management’s estimates
and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.
The Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at
reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records
are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are
augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training
of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits.
The Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an
opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets
periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each
is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche
LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
RISKS
We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. We use
derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements.
Foreign Currencies
Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency
exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions, including hedges. Principal
currency exposures include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar.
Interest Rate
Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage
the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed-income
indices.
Credit
Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We manage credit exposures
relative to broad-based indices to facilitate portfolio diversification.
Equity
Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to price risk.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 — ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounting Principles
Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).
We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior period
amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows
statements.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated.
Estimates and Assumptions
Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition,
determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price
(“SSP”) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss
contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our
reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the
market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility
is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated
financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results
and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.
In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in
software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in
technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four
years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023.
Foreign Currencies
Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue
and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting
from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.
Revenue
Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue
Product revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity and collaboration applications, server
applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video
games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related
accessories.
Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services,
platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and gaming; solution support; and consulting services.
Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.
48

--- Page 50 ---

Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects
the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include
various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate
performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers,
which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
Nature of Products and Services
Licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available
to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the
same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from
distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer.
In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional
charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related
device or license.
Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software
Assurance (“SA”). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support,
tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct
performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract
period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance
obligations that are satisfied over time.
Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the
software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a
subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a
consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such
resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the
individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are
provided.
Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action
necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are
provided.
Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function
without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance
obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end
customers through retail stores and online marketplaces.
Refer to Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant
product and service offering.
Significant Judgments
Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining
whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately
versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses
and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted
for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud
services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the
desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from
Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.
J udgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate
SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no
additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately
49

--- Page 51 ---

and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and
services.
In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we
determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have
more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers
and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in
determining the SSP.
Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery,
including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.
Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances
we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when
determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at
the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable
consideration were not material for the periods presented.
Contract Balances and Other Receivables
Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue
is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year
agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a
receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice
and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.
Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and
cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year
agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting
services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-
delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the
revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.
Refer to Note 13 – Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in
unearned revenue during the period.
Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30
to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined
our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to
provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing
from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription
term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced
annually with revenue recognized upfront.
As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $4.9 billion and
$4.5 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.
The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable
balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently
available evidence.

As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, other receivables related to activities to facilitate the purchase of server components were
$10.5 billion and $9.2 billion, respectively, and are included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.
We record financing receivables when we offer certain customers the option to acquire our software products and services
offerings through a financing program in a limited number of countries. As of June 30, 2024 and 2023, our financing
receivables, net were $4.5 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which
are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We record an allowance
to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.
Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer
We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those
costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be
capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in
other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.
We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the
amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales organization compensation
program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with
annual sales activities.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs
related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold
by original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs
incurred to support and maintain cloud-based and other online products and services, including datacenter costs and
royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the
amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the
estimated lives of the products.
P roduct Warranty
We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related
revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure
rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware
warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally
include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate
51

--- Page 53 ---

the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our
estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other
headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-
party development and programming costs and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such
costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological
feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production.
Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated
lives of the products.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other
headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade
shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.7 billion,
$904 million, and $1.5 billion in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation
Compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”),
is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related
service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the
grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the fair value
of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method
and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method.
Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) is measured as the discount the employee is
entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.
Income Taxes
Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions.
Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of
such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation
allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as
long-term in our consolidated balance sheets.
Financial Instruments
Investments
We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to
be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with
original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term
investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature
and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.
Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific
identification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive
income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by
management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market
conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To determine
credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. In
addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If
we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery,
52

--- Page 54 ---

then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost
basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future
impairments.
Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily
determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable
changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a
periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than
carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net.
Investments that are considered variable interest entities (“VIEs”) are evaluated to determine whether we are the primary
beneficiary of the VIE, in which case we would be required to consolidate the entity. We evaluate whether we have (1) the
power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb
losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We have determined we
are not the primary beneficiary of any of our VIE investments. Therefore, our VIE investments are not consolidated and the
majority are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
Derivatives
Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes
in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.
For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense),
net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from
the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.
For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other
comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item.
Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other
income (expense), net.
For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily
recognized in other income (expense), net.
Fair Value Measurements
We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the
extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value
measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement
in its entirety. These levels are:
• Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our
Level 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our
Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.
• Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for
identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the
Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by
observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models
project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable
inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for
currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities,
foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal
securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-
counter forward, option, and swap contracts.
• Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that
market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using
model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets
and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and
53

--- Page 55 ---

intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used
in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.
We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these
investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted
market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.
Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor,
and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated
selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on
hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a
reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method
over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and
equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three years; computer
equipment, two to six years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and
furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.
Leases
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use
(“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases
are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance
sheets.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation
to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at
commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not
provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for
collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset
also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or
terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain
equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU
assets and liabilities.
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment)
on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely
than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
Intangible Assets
Our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized over the estimated useful life in proportion to the
economic benefits received. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events
or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.

Related Party Transactions
In March 2024, we entered into an agreement with Inflection AI, Inc. (“Inflection”), pursuant to which we obtained a non-
exclusive license to Inflection’s intellectual property. Reid Hoffman, a member of our Board of Directors, is a co-founder of
and serves on the board of directors of Inflection. As of the date of the agreement with Inflection, Reprogrammed
Interchange LLC (“Reprogrammed”) and entities affiliated with Greylock Ventures (“Greylock”) each held less than a 10%
equity interest in Inflection. Mr. Hoffman may be deemed to beneficially own the shares held by Reprogrammed and
Greylock by virtue of his relationship with such entities. Mr. Hoffman did not participate in any portions of the meetings of
our Board of Directors or any committee thereof to review and approve the transaction with Inflection.
Recent Accounting Guidance
Segment Reporting – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new standard to improve reportable
segment disclosures. The guidance expands the disclosures required for reportable segments in our annual and interim
consolidated financial statements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The
standard will be effective for us beginning with our annual reporting for fiscal year 2025 and interim periods thereafter, with
early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our segment disclosures.
Income Taxes – Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
In December 2023, the FASB issued a new standard to improve income tax disclosures. The guidance requires disclosure
of disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standardized categories for the components of the effective tax rate
reconciliation, and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. The standard will be effective for us beginning with our
annual reporting for fiscal year 2026, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard
on our income tax disclosures.

NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock
plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive
potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.
T he components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows:

NOTE 5 — DERIVATIVES
We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, interest rates, equity prices, and credit; to
enhance investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing,
eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative
programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.
F oreign Currencies
Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency
exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions.
59

--- Page 61 ---

Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange
forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-
denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging
instruments.
Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign
exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.
Interest Rate
Interest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value
hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.
Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage
the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-
income indices using option, futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and
are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below.
Equity
Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options, futures,
and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.
Credit
Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap
contracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. These
contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below.
Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features
Certain counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-
term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of
$1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard
convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2024, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and
cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted.

NOTE 8 — BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
Activision Blizzard, Inc.
On October 13, 2023, we completed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (“Activision Blizzard”) for a total purchase
price of $75.4 billion, consisting primarily of cash. Activision Blizzard is a leader in game development and an interactive
entertainment content publisher. The acquisition will accelerate the growth in our gaming business across mobile, PC,
console, and cloud gaming. The financial results of Activision Blizzard have been included in our consolidated financial
statements since the date of the acquisition. Activision Blizzard is reported as part of our More Personal Computing segment.
The purchase price allocation as of the date of acquisition was based on a preliminary valuation and is subject to revision
as more detailed analyses are completed and additional information about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed becomes available. The primary areas that remain preliminary relate to the fair values of goodwill and income
taxes.
The major classes of assets and liabilities to which we have preliminarily allocated the purchase price were as follows:
(In millions)
Cash and cash equivalents $ 12,976
Goodwill 50,969
Intangible assets 21,969
Other assets 2,501
Long-term debt (2,799)
Long-term income taxes (1,914)
Deferred income taxes (4,677)
Other liabilities (3,617)
Total purchase price $ 75,408
G oodwill was assigned to our More Personal Computing segment. The goodwill was primarily attributed to increased
synergies that are expected to be achieved from the integration of Activision Blizzard. Substantially all of the goodwill is
expected to be non-deductible for income tax purposes.

These pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we believe are reasonable. They are not the
results that would have been realized had we been a combined company during the periods presented and are not
necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations in future periods. The pro forma results include adjustments
related to purchase accounting, primarily amortization of intangible assets. Acquisition costs and other nonrecurring charges
were immaterial and are included in the earliest period presented.
Nuance Communications, Inc.
On March 4, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. (“Nuance”) for a total purchase price of
$18.8 billion, consisting primarily of cash. Nuance is a cloud and artificial intelligence (“AI”) software provider with healthcare
and enterprise AI experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings. The financial results of
Nuance have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. Nuance is reported
as part of our Intelligent Cloud segment.
T he allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of December 31, 2022. The major classes of assets and
liabilities to which we have allocated the purchase price were as follows:
(In millions)
Goodwill (a) $ 16,326
Intangible assets 4,365
Other assets 42
Other liabilities (b) (1,972)
Total $ 18,761

information.
The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the
facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months.
Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods in
which the adjustments are determined.
Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are
presented as “Other” in the table above. Also included in “Other” are business dispositions and transfers between segments
due to reorganizations, as applicable.
G oodwill Impairment
We test goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow
methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted cash flow
approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses.
No instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2024, May 1, 2023, or May 1, 2022 tests. As of June 30, 2024 and
2023, accumulated goodwill impairment was $11.3 billion.

Effective Tax Rate
The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate and our effective
rate were as follows:

Foreign earnings taxed at lower rates (1.4)% (1.8)% (1.3)%

Interest, net 1.1% 0.8% 0.5%
Other reconciling items, net (0.7)% 0.5% (0.7)%
Effective rate 18.2% 19.0% 13.1%
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the
U.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year
2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed
income (“GILTI”) tax.
The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2024 and 2023 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates
in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional
operations center in Ireland. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2022 is primarily due to the net
income tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions
resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland,
and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. In fiscal years 2024 and 2023, our foreign regional operating center
in Ireland, which is taxed at a rate lower than the U.S. rate, generated 83% and 81% of our foreign income before tax. In
fiscal year 2022, our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the
U.S. rate, generated 71% of our foreign income before tax. Other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits and
GILTI tax, and in fiscal year 2024, includes tax benefits from tax law changes. In fiscal year 2024, tax benefits from tax law
changes primarily relates to the issuance of Notice 2023-55 and Notice 2023-80 by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
and U.S. Treasury Department. Notice 2023-55, issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, delayed the effective date of
final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal year 2024 for Microsoft. Notice 2023-80, issued in the second quarter of fiscal
year 2024, further delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations indefinitely. In fiscal years 2024, 2023,
and 2022, there were no individually significant other reconciling items.
The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to tax benefits
from tax law changes, including the delay of the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations. The increase in our
effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit
in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating
to stock-based compensation.

As of June 30, 2024, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $476 million, $899 million, and
$2.6 billion, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards have varying expiration dates ranging from
fiscal year 2025 to 2044 or indefinite carryforward periods, if not utilized. The majority of our foreign net operating loss
carryforwards do not expire. Certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation but are
expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. As of June 30, 2024, we had
$456 million federal capital loss carryforwards for U.S. tax purposes from our acquisition of Nuance. The federal capital loss
carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation and will expire in fiscal year 2025.
The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards, federal capital
loss carryforwards, and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized.
Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $23.4 billion, $23.1 billion, and $16.0 billion in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022,
respectively.

Uncertain Tax Positions
Gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, were $22.8 billion,
$17.1 billion, and $15.6 billion, respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated
balance sheets. If recognized, the resulting tax benefit would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and
2022 by $19.6 billion, $14.4 billion, and $13.3 billion, respectively.
As of June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $6.8 billion,
$5.2 billion, and $4.3 billion, respectively, net of income tax benefits. The provision for income taxes for fiscal years 2024,
2023, and 2022 included interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $1.5 billion, $918 million, and $36 million,

We remain under audit by the IRS for tax years 2014 to 2017. With respect to the audit for tax years 2004 to 2013, on
September 26, 2023, we received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS. The primary issues in the
NOPAs relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an additional tax payment of $28.9 billion
plus penalties and interest. As of June 30, 2024, we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We
disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the NOPAs through the IRS’s administrative appeals
office and, if necessary, judicial proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.
Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our income tax
contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.
We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to
examination for tax years 1996 to 2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of
each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 15 — CONTINGENCIES
U.S. Cell Phone Litigation
Microsoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a
defendant in 45 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio
emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility
for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the
Nokia defendants. Twelve of these cases were consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are
stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims
arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency
emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either
operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also
allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.
In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on
the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion
to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia
Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals
issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further
proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by
the court. A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022. In April of 2023, the court granted defendants’
motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs’ experts that cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an order excluding all of
plaintiffs’ experts from testifying. The parties agreed to a stipulated dismissal of the consolidated cases to allow plaintiffs to
appeal the expert testimony order. Plaintiffs appealed the court’s order in August of 2023, and the parties have filed their
briefs on the appeal. A hearing on the status of the stayed cases occurred in December of 2023. In July 2024, the court
entered summary judgment in nine of the stayed cases on the grounds that plaintiffs had agreed to be bound by the general
causation outcome in the consolidated cases.
Irish Data Protection Commission Matter
In 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (“IDPC”) began investigating a complaint against LinkedIn as to whether
LinkedIn’s targeted advertising practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection
Regulation (“GDPR”). Microsoft cooperated throughout the period of inquiry. In April 2023, the IDPC provided LinkedIn with
a non-public preliminary draft decision alleging GDPR violations and proposing a fine. In July 2024, the IDPC provided
LinkedIn with a revised non-public draft decision. There is no set timeline for the IDPC to issue a final decision, at which
time Microsoft will consider its options to appeal.
Other Contingencies
We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business.
Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a
material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and
management’s view of these matters may change in the future.
As of June 30, 2024, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $641 million. While we intend to defend these matters
vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $600 million in aggregate beyond recorded
amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material
adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.

NOTE 19 — SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA
In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive
Officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis
not consistent with GAAP. During the periods presented, we reported our financial performance based on the following
segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.
Our reportable segments are described below.
Productivity and Business Processes
Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity,
communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises:
• Office Commercial (Office 365 subscriptions, the Office 365 portion of Microsoft 365 Commercial subscriptions,
and Office licensed on-premises), comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Office 365
Security and Compliance, Microsoft Viva, and Copilot for Microsoft 365.
• Office Consumer, including Microsoft 365 Consumer and Copilot Pro subscriptions, Office licensed on-
premises, and other Office services.
• LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions.
• Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics 365, comprising a set of intelligent, cloud-based applications
across ERP, CRM, Power Apps, and Power Automate; and on-premises ERP and CRM applications.
78

--- Page 80 ---

Intelligent Cloud
Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power
modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises:
• Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services; SQL Server, Windows Server,
Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”); and Nuance and GitHub.
• Enterprise and partner services, including Enterprise Support Services, Industry Solutions, Nuance
professional services, Microsoft Partner Network, and Learning Experience.
More Personal Computing
Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the experience
with our technology. This segment primarily comprises:
• Windows, including Windows OEM licensing and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system;
Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services,
and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; and Windows Internet of Things.
• Devices, including Surface, HoloLens, and PC accessories.
• Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first-party content (such as
Activision Blizzard) and third-party content, including games and in-game content; Xbox Game Pass and other
subscriptions; Xbox Cloud Gaming; advertising; third-party disc royalties; and other cloud services.
• Search and news advertising, comprising Bing (including Copilot), Microsoft News, Microsoft Edge, and third-
party affiliates.
Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our
business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from
certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services,
which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit
margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that
are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit
and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.
In addition, certain costs are incurred at a corporate level and allocated to our segments. These allocated costs generally
include legal, including settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise taxes, field selling,
shared facilities services, customer service and support, and severance incurred as part of a corporate program. Each
allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated and is generally
based on relative gross margin or relative headcount.
Segment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods presented:

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and
stockholders’ equity, for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2024, and the related notes (collectively
referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, based on criteria established in
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated July 30, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB
and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and
the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether
due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also
included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements
that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or
disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex
judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements,
taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the
critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Revenue Recognition – Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company offers
customers the ability to acquire multiple licenses of software products and services, including cloud-based services, in its
customer agreements through its volume licensing programs.
S ignificant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for certain customer agreements, and
includes the following:
• Determination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be
accounted for separately versus together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold with cloud-based
services.
81

--- Page 83 ---

• The pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance obligation.
• Identification and treatment of contract terms that may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized (e.g.,
variable consideration, optional purchases, and free services).
• Determination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation and for products and services that
are not sold separately.
Given these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit effort in evaluating management’s judgments
in determining revenue recognition for certain customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor
judgment.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our principal audit procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition for certain customer agreements included the
following:
• We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the identification of distinct performance obligations, the determination
of the timing of revenue recognition, and the estimation of variable consideration.
• We evaluated management’s significant accounting policies related to certain customer agreements for
reasonableness.
• We selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures:
- Obtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other documents
that were part of the agreement.
- Tested management’s identification and treatment of contract terms.
- Assessed the terms in the customer agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of management’s application of
their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions.
• We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s estimate of stand-alone selling prices for products and services
that are not sold separately.
• We tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue
recognized in the financial statements.
Income Taxes – Uncertain Tax Positions – Refer to Note 12 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s long-term income taxes liability includes uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing issues that remain
unresolved with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). The Company remains under IRS audit, or subject to IRS audit, for
tax years subsequent to 2003. In the current fiscal year, the Company received Notices of Proposed Adjustments (“NOPAs”)
for the tax years 2004 to 2013, primarily related to intercompany transfer pricing. While the Company has settled a portion
of the IRS audits, resolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.
Conclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment
and include complex considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit
settlements. Given the complexity and the subjective nature of certain transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with
the IRS, evaluating management’s estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions required extensive
audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our principal audit procedures to evaluate management’s estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer
pricing issues included the following:
• We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and assumptions used in the
identification, recognition, measurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the
effectiveness of the related internal controls.
82

--- Page 84 ---

• We read and evaluated management’s documentation, including relevant accounting policies and information obtained
by management from outside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions.
• We tested the reasonableness of management’s judgments regarding the future resolution of the uncertain tax
positions, including an evaluation of the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions.
• For those uncertain tax positions that had not been effectively settled, we evaluated whether management had
appropriately considered new information, including the NOPAs received in the current fiscal year, that could
significantly change the recognition, measurement, or disclosure of the uncertain tax positions.
• We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s estimates by considering how tax law, including statutes,
regulations, and case law, impacted management’s judgments.
Business Combinations – Estimate for Valuation of Acquired Intangible Assets – Refer to Note 8 to the financial
statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
On October 13, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. The Company accounted for the
Activision Blizzard, Inc., acquisition as a business combination and, accordingly, allocated the purchase price to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Identifiable
intangible assets acquired included marketing-related intangible assets, technology-based intangible assets, and customer-
related intangible assets. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and
liabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill.
We identified the fair value determination of certain marketing-related and technology-based intangible assets for the
business combination as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgment required in determining their estimated fair
values. Management’s estimates of fair value included assumptions for revenue and expense forecasts and the selection
of appropriate discount rates. There was a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in applying audit procedures
and evaluating the significant assumptions relating to the estimates, including involvement of our fair value specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to management’s estimates of the fair value of certain marketing-related and technology-
based intangible assets acquired included the following, among others:
• We tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the business combination, including internal controls
over the revenue and expense forecasts and the selection of appropriate discount rates.
• We assessed the knowledge, skills, abilities, and objectivity of management’s valuation specialist and evaluated the
work performed.
• When assessing the reasonableness of assumptions related to forecasted revenue and expenses, we evaluated
whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering historical financial information of Activision Blizzard, Inc.,
and the Company’s forecasted financial information.
• With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rates by:
- Testing the source information underlying the discount rates and testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculations.
83

- Developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management.

Not applicable.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange
Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the
Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately
and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for
preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of
company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated
financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial
statements would be prevented or detected.
Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the
framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. Our assessment of, and conclusion on, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
did not include the internal controls of Activision Blizzard, Inc., acquired on October 13, 2023, which is included in our
consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition and represented less than 1% of our total assets as of
June 30, 2024 after excluding goodwill and intangible assets acquired, and 2% of our total revenues for the year ended
June 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of June 30, 2024. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during
the quarter ended June 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30,
2024; their report follows.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as
of June 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal
Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2024, of the Company and our report
dated July 30, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
As described in Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its
assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Activision Blizzard, Inc., which was acquired on October 13, 2023,
and whose financial statements constitute less than 1 percent of total assets as of June 30, 2024 after excluding goodwill
and intangible assets acquired, and 2 percent of total revenues for the year ended June 30, 2024. Accordingly, our audit
did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Activision Blizzard, Inc.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of
Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and
are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing
the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
