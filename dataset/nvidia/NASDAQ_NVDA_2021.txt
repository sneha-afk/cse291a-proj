While the Board benefits from the experience and institutional knowledge that our longer-serving directors bring, it has also brought in new perspectives and ideas by appointing two new directors in the past year:  John O. Dabiri, a professor of aeronautics and mechanical engineering at the California Institute of Technology, and Aarti Shah, an IT, digital health, cybersecurity, and advanced analytics & data sciences executive at Eli Lilly and Company.  Additionally, James C.

We seek a collaborative approach to stockholder issues that affect our business and to ensure that our stockholders see our governance and executive pay practices as well-structured.  In the Fall of 2020, we contacted our top institutional holders who held 1% or more of our stock (with the exception of brokerage firms and index funds who we know do not engage in direct conversations), representing an aggregate ownership of 33%, to gain insights into their views on corporate governance; ESG issues; and our response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Members of our management and Board, including our Lead Director, met with stockholders holding, in total, 32% of our common stock outstanding.Highlights of our corporate governance practices include:  ü All Board members independent, except for our CEOü Independent Lead Directorü Proxy accessü Declassified Boardü Majority voting for directorsü Active Board oversight of risk and risk management,     including for the Company’s COVID-19 responseü 75% or greater attendance by each Board member at      meetings of the Board and applicable committeesü Independent directors frequently meet in executive       sessionsü At least annual Board and committee self-assessmentsü Annual stockholder outreach, including regular Lead      Director participationü Stock ownership guidelines for our directors and      executive officers4Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation for Fiscal 2021 (Proposal 2)We are asking our stockholders to cast a non-binding vote, also known as “say-on-pay,” to approve our NEOs’ compensation. The Board believes that our compensation policies and practices are effective in achieving our goals of paying for performance; providing competitive pay so that we may attract and retain a high-caliber executive team; aligning our executives’ interests with those of our stockholders to create long-term value; and achieving simplicity and transparency with our compensation program. The Board and our stockholders have approved holding our “say-on-pay” votes annually. Executive Compensation HighlightsOur executive compensation program is designed to pay for performance.  We utilize compensation elements that align our NEOs’ interests with those of our stockholders to create long-term value.  Our NEO pay is heavily weighted toward performance-based, “at-risk” variable cash and long-term equity awards that are only earned if the Company achieves pre-established corporate financial metrics, but capped at a maximum of 200% of target (or 150% of target for our CEO’s PSUs).  For the last several years, over 90% of our CEO’s, and over 50% of our other NEOs’, target pay has been performance-based and at-risk, and 100% of our CEO’s equity awards have been in the form of PSUs only.At our 2020 Meeting, over 95% of the votes cast approved the compensation paid to our NEOs for Fiscal 2020.  After considering this advisory vote and the feedback from our annual stockholder outreach, our CC concluded that our program effectively aligned executive pay with stockholder interests.  Therefore, the CC maintained the same general executive compensation structure for Fiscal 2021, but increased the rigor of the performance goals for revenue and Non-GAAP Operating Income by setting the Threshold goals above Fiscal 2020 actual achievement, and increased the proportion of target pay that is “at-risk” to strengthen the link between corporate performance and executive pay. Financial Performance and Link to Executive PayDespite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, in Fiscal 2021, we achieved record revenue for our Gaming and Data Center market platforms and for the overall Company, enhanced our networking technologies by completing the acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd., launched the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture for our Gaming and Data Center platforms, and announced a partnership with Mercedes-Benz to introduce software-defined, intelligent vehicles using end-to-end NVIDIA technology.  As described further in our CD&A, a significant portion of our executive pay opportunities are tied to the achievement of financial measures that drive business value and contribute to our long-term success.  While COVID-19 affected our business in both positive and negative ways, the CC determined not to make any changes to our Fiscal 2021 executive compensation performance goals or in certification of actual Fiscal 2021 results as a result of COVID-19.  In accordance with the performance goals and methodology established by the CC in early Fiscal 2021, the CC excluded the additional revenue and the estimated unaudited operating income and costs generated by acquisitions completed during Fiscal 2021 in its certification of Fiscal 2021 results.  The CC determined the foregoing approach best aligned our executives’ interests with those of our stockholders and remained consistent with our pay for performance philosophy.  The table below shows our goals for the applicable period ended Fiscal 2021 and their respective impact on our executive pay.

If our stockholders do not ratify the selection, the AC will reconsider the appointment, but may nevertheless retain PwC. Even if the selection is ratified, the AC may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of NVIDIA and our stockholders.Approval of an Amendment to our Charter to Increase the Number of Authorized Shares of Common Stock from 2 Billion Shares to 4 Billion Shares (Proposal 4)We are asking our stockholders to approve an amendment to our Charter to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from two billion shares to four billion shares.  The Charter amendment will provide adequate shares of common stock to be used by the Board for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, expanding our business through mergers and acquisitions, including shares we would be obligated to issue in connection with the pending acquisition of Arm Limited; stock dividends and/or stock splits; providing equity incentives to employees, officers or directors; and the raising of additional capital.Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance InitiativesNVIDIA invents the computing technologies that enable scientists, engineers, designers, researchers, and developers to improve lives everywhere and address global challenges. We integrate sound ESG principles and practices into every aspect of the Company, including the following initiatives:•Human capital management:  To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented employees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and research and development personnel. •Diversity and inclusion:  We believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to a more inclusive culture that supports all employees, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, veteran status, race, ethnicity, or disability.  We have increased our efforts to recruit, develop, and retain a more diverse workforce with a focus on those historically underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black, and Hispanic candidates.•Climate change and the environment:  We integrate energy efficiency principles into our products and drive operational excellence to reduce our environmental impact.  We have a goal to source 65 percent of our global electricity use from renewable energy by the end of Fiscal 2025.•Public policy engagement and accountability:  We engage in public policy advocacy to affect government action on issues of importance to our business, customers, stockholders, and employees, and to provide thought leadership to global governments on issues that directly affect our business. We also belong to a number of trade associations worldwide, representing the interests of the technology industry, industries in which we operate and the broader business community.  We make no contributions of any kind to political parties or candidates, including any direct contributions to any intermediary organizations, such as political action committees (PACs) or lobbyists, campaign funds, or trade or industry associations and super PACs.6NVIDIA CORPORATION2788 SAN TOMAS EXPRESSWAYSANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA 95051(408) 486-2000  ____________________________________________________PROXY STATEMENT FOR THE 2021 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS - JUNE 3, 2021  ____________________________________________________INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETINGYour proxy is being solicited for use at the 2021 Meeting on behalf of the Board.  Our 2021 Meeting will take place virtually on Thursday, June 3, 2021 at 11:00 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time. Virtual Meeting Philosophy and BenefitsThe Board believes that holding the meeting in a virtual format invites stockholder participation, while reducing the costs to stockholders and the Company associated with an in-person meeting. This balance allows the meeting to remain focused on matters directly relevant to the interests of stockholders in an efficient way.  We have designed the virtual format to protect stockholder rights, including by offering multiple opportunities to ask questions, publishing answers to questions received before or during the meeting on our Investor Relations website, and providing an archived copy of the webcast after the meeting.Meeting AttendanceIf you were an NVIDIA stockholder as of the close of business on the April 5, 2021 record date, or if you hold a valid proxy, you can attend, ask questions during, and vote at our 2021 Meeting at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/NVIDIA2021.  Our meeting will be held virtually; use the Control Number included on your Notice or printed proxy card to enter.  Anyone can also listen to the meeting live at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/NVIDIA2021.  If you encounter any difficulties accessing the virtual meeting during the check-in or the course of the annual meeting, please call the technical support number available on www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/NVIDIA2021.An archived copy of the webcast will be available at www.nvidia.com/proxy through June 17, 2021.  Even if you plan to attend the 2021 Meeting virtually, we recommend that you also vote by proxy as described below so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend. Asking QuestionsWe encourage stockholders to submit questions through our pre-meeting forum located at www.proxyvote.com (using the Control Number included on your Notice or printed proxy card) as well as during the meeting at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/NVIDIA2021.  During the meeting, we will answer as many stockholder-submitted questions related to the business of the meeting as time permits. As soon as practicable following the meeting, we will publish and answer questions received, if pertinent to Company business, on our Investor Relations website.  We intend to group questions and answers by topic and substantially similar questions will be answered only once. To promote fairness to all stockholders and efficient use of the Company’s resources, we will respond to one question per stockholder.7Quorum and VotingTo hold our 2021 Meeting, we need a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the close of business on the April 5, 2021 record date, or a quorum, represented at the 2021 Meeting either by attendance virtually or by proxy. On April 5, 2021, there were 622,383,615 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote, meaning that 311,191,808 shares must be represented at the 2021 Meeting or by proxy to have a quorum.  A list of stockholders entitled to vote at the close of business on the April 5, 2021 record date will be available during the entire time of the annual meeting at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/NVIDIA2021 and electronically for 10 days prior to the annual meeting to registered stockholders for any legally valid purpose related to the annual meeting.  For access to the stockholder list, please contact us at shareholdermeeting@nvidia.com.Your shares will be counted towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy or vote at the 2021 Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted towards the quorum requirement.  If there is not a quorum, a majority of the votes present may adjourn the meeting to another date.You may vote FOR any nominee to the Board, you may WITHHOLD your vote for any nominee or you may ABSTAIN from voting. For each other matter to be voted on, you may vote FOR or AGAINST or ABSTAIN from voting.Stockholder of RecordYou are a stockholder of record if your shares were registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, on April 5, 2021, and you can vote shares, change your vote or revoke your proxy before the final vote at the 2021 Meeting in any of the following ways:VoteChange Your VoteRevoke Your ProxyAttend the 2021 Meeting virtually and vote during the meetingüüVia mail, by signing and mailing your proxy card to us before the 2021 MeetingüBy telephone or via the Internet, by following the instructions provided in the Notice or your proxy materialsüüSubmit another properly completed proxy card with a later dateüSend a written notice that you are revoking your proxy to NVIDIA Corporation, 2788 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, California 95051, Attention: Timothy S. Teter, Secretary or via email to shareholdermeeting@nvidia.comüIf you do not vote using any of the ways described above, your shares will not be voted.Street Name Holder  If your shares are held through a nominee, such as a bank or broker, as of April 5, 2021, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in “street name,” and you have the right to direct the nominee how to vote those shares for the 2021 Meeting. The nominee should provide you a separate Notice or voting instructions, and you should follow those instructions to tell the nominee how to vote. To vote by attending the 2021 Meeting virtually, you must obtain a valid proxy from your nominee.  If you are a beneficial holder and do not provide voting instructions to your nominee, the nominee will not be authorized to vote your shares on “non-routine” matters, including elections of directors (even if not contested), executive compensation (including any advisory stockholder votes on executive compensation) and amendments of charter documents.  This is called a “broker non-vote.”  However, the nominee can still register your shares as being present at the 2021 Meeting for determining quorum, and the nominee will have discretion to vote for matters considered by the NYSE to be “routine,” including the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm. Therefore, you MUST give your nominee instructions in order for your vote to be counted on the proposals to elect directors, to conduct an advisory approval of our executive compensation, and to amend our Charter.  We strongly encourage you to vote.Note that under the rules of the national stock exchanges, any NVIDIA stockholder whose shares are held in street name by a member brokerage firm may revoke a proxy and vote his or her shares at the 2021 Meeting only in accordance with applicable rules and procedures of those exchanges, as employed by the street name holder’s brokerage firm. 8Vote CountOn each matter to be voted upon, stockholders have one vote for each share of NVIDIA common stock owned as of April 5, 2021.

Final voting results will be published in a current report on Form 8-K, which will be filed with the SEC by June 9, 2021.Proxy MaterialsAs permitted by SEC rules, we are making our proxy materials available to stockholders online at www.nvidia.com/proxy.  On or about April  22, 2021, we sent stockholders who own our common stock at the close of business on April 5, 2021 (other than those who previously requested electronic or paper delivery) a Notice containing instructions on how to access our proxy materials, vote via the Internet or by telephone, and elect to receive future proxy materials electronically or in printed form by mail.If you choose to receive future proxy materials electronically (via www.proxyvote.com for stockholders of record and www.icsdelivery.com/nvda for street name holders), you will receive an email next year with links to the proxy materials and proxy voting site. SEC rules also permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy Notice and proxy material delivery requirements for multiple stockholders with the same address by delivering a single Notice or set of proxy materials addressed to those stockholders.  We follow this practice, known as “householding,” unless we have received contrary instructions from any stockholder at that address. If you received more than one Notice or full set of proxy materials, then your shares are either registered in more than one name or are held in different accounts. Please vote the shares covered by each Notice or proxy card. To modify your instructions so that you receive one Notice or proxy card for each account or name, please contact your broker. Your “householding” election will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. To make a change regarding the form in which you receive proxy materials (electronically or in print), or to request receipt of a separate set of documents to a household, contact our Investor Relations Department (through our website at www.nvidia.com, with an email to shareholdermeeting@nvidia.com, by phone at (408) 486-2000 or by mail at 2788 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, California 95051).We will pay the entire cost of soliciting proxies. Our directors and employees may also solicit proxies in person, by telephone, by mail, via the Internet or by other means of communication.  Our directors and employees will not be paid any additional compensation for soliciting proxies. We have also retained MacKenzie Partners on an advisory basis for an approximate fee of $15,000 and they may help us solicit proxies from brokers, bank nominees and other institutional 9owners. We may also reimburse brokerage firms, banks and other agents for the cost of forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners.2022 Meeting Stockholder Proposals To be considered for inclusion in next year’s proxy materials, your proposal must be submitted in writing by December 24, 2021 to NVIDIA Corporation, 2788 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, California 95051, Attention: Timothy S. Teter, Secretary or by email to shareholdermeeting@nvidia.com, and must comply with all applicable requirements of Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Exchange Act.  However, if we do not hold our 2022 Meeting between May 4, 2022 and July 3, 2022, then the deadline is a reasonable time before we begin to print and send our proxy materials. If you wish to submit a proposal for consideration at the 2022 Meeting that is not to be included in next year’s proxy materials, you must do so in writing following the above instructions not later than the close of business on March 5, 2022, and not earlier than February 3, 2022.

The committee is committed to Board diversity and shall consider a nominee’s background and experience to ensure that a broad range of perspectives is represented on the Board.  The NCGC may conduct any appropriate and necessary inquiries into the backgrounds and qualifications of possible candidates, and may also engage a professional search firm to identify and assist the committee in identifying, evaluating, and conducting due diligence on potential director nominees. The NCGC has not established specific age, gender, education, experience, or skill requirements for potential members, and instead considers numerous factors regarding the nominee taking into account our current and future business models, including the following: •Integrity and candor•Independence•Senior leadership and operational experience•Professional, technical and industry knowledge•Financial expertise•Financial community experience (including as an investor in other companies)•Marketing, communications and brand management background•Governance and public company board experience•Experience with emerging technologies and new business models•Regulatory, legal and risk management expertise•Diversity, including race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender or membership in another underrepresented community•Human capital management experience•Experience in academia•Willingness and ability to devote substantial time and effort to Board responsibilities and Company oversight•Ability to represent the interests of the stockholders as a whole rather than special interest groups or constituencies•All relationships between the proposed nominee and any of our stockholders, competitors, customers, suppliers or other persons with a relationship to NVIDIA•For nominees for re-election, overall service to NVIDIA, including past attendance at Board and committee meetings and participation and contributions to the activities of the BoardThe NCGC and the Board understand the importance of Board refreshment, and strive to maintain an appropriate balance of tenure, diversity, professional experience and backgrounds, skills, and education on the Board.  While the Board benefits from the experience and institutional knowledge that our longer-serving directors bring, it has also brought in new perspectives and ideas by appointing two new directors in the past year: John O. Dabiri, a professor of aeronautics and mechanical engineering at the California Institute of Technology, and Aarti Shah, an IT, digital health, cybersecurity, and advanced analytics & data sciences executive at Eli Lilly and Company.  Our longer-tenured directors are familiar with our operations and business areas and have the perspective of overseeing our activities from a variety of economic and competitive environments. Our new directors have brought expertise in brand development and cybersecurity and familiarity with technology developments at leading academic institutions that are important to supporting NVIDIA as it enters new markets.  Each year, the NCGC and Board review each director’s individual performance, including the director’s past contributions, outside experiences and activities, and committee participation, and determine how his or her experience and skills continue to add value to NVIDIA and the Board.12Below are the skills, competencies and attributes that our Board considers important for our directors to have considering our current business and future market opportunities:Senior Leadership & Operations ExperienceDirectors with senior leadership and operations experience provide experienced oversight of our business, and unique experiences and perspectives.

This experience supports our goals of strong Board and management accountability, transparency, and protection of shareholder interests.  Public company board experience also helps our directors identify challenges and risks we face as a public company, including oversight of strategic, operational, compliance-related matters and relations with shareholders.Emerging Technologies & Business ModelsDirectors with experience in emerging technologies and business models are integral to our growth strategies given our unique business model and provide important insights as our business expands into new areas.Marketing, Communications & Brand ManagementDirectors with experience in marketing, communications and brand management offer guidance on our products directly marketed to consumers, important perspectives on expanding our market share and communicating with our customers and other stakeholders.Regulatory, Legal & Risk ManagementOur business requires compliance with a variety of regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions.

Directors with experience in governmental, public policy, legal and risk management areas, including cybersecurity, help provide valuable insights and oversight for our Company.Human Capital Management ExperienceOur people are critical to our success.  Directors with experience in organizational management, talent development, managing and developing values and culture in a large global workforce provide key insights.

After considering all relevant relationships and transactions, our Board determined that, except for Mr. Huang, all of our directors are “independent” as defined by Nasdaq’s rules and regulations. In addition, the Board previously determined that James C. Gaither, a former director who retired from our Board effective June 9, 2020, was independent under applicable Nasdaq listing standards.  The Board also determined that all members of our AC, CC and NCGC are independent under applicable Nasdaq listing standards, and that each of Messrs. McCaffery, Perry and Seawell and Ms. Hudson of the AC are “audit committee financial experts” as defined under applicable SEC rules.Board Leadership StructureOur Board believes that each of its members should have an equal voice in the affairs and the management of NVIDIA, and therefore, our stockholders are best served at this time by having an independent Lead Director, rather than having a chairperson.  Our Lead Director is an integral part of our Board structure and a critical aspect of our effective corporate governance. The independent directors consider the role and designation of the Lead Director on an annual basis, and Mr. Perry was appointed as our Lead Director in 2018. In addition, Mr. Perry serves on both the NCGC and the AC, which affords him increased engagement with Board governance and composition as well as with risk assessment and management, and financial and regulatory matters of the Company. While the CEO has primary responsibility for preparing the agendas for Board meetings and presiding over the portion of the meetings of the Board where he is present, our Lead Director has significant responsibilities, which are set forth in our Corporate Governance Policies, and include, in part:•Determining an appropriate schedule of Board meetings, and seeking to ensure that the independent members of the Board can perform their duties responsibly while not interfering with the flow of our operations;•Working with the CEO, and seeking input from other directors and relevant management, as to the preparation of the agendas for Board meetings;•Advising the CEO on a regular basis as to the quality, quantity and timeliness of the flow of information requested by the Board from our management with the goal of providing what is necessary for the independent members of the Board to effectively and responsibly perform their duties, and, although our management is responsible for the preparation of materials for the Board, the Lead Director may specifically request the inclusion of certain material; and•Coordinating, developing the agenda for, and moderating executive sessions of the independent members of the Board, and acting as principal liaison between them and the CEO on sensitive issues.The active involvement of our independent directors, combined with the qualifications and significant responsibilities of our Lead Director, provide balance on the Board and promote strong, independent oversight of our management and affairs.Role of the Board in Risk OversightThe Board is responsible for overseeing risk management at NVIDIA and delegates oversight of appropriate topics to its committees. Our AC has the responsibility to consider and discuss major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control these exposures. The AC also monitors compliance with certain legal and regulatory requirements and oversees the performance of the internal audit function.  Our NCGC monitors the effectiveness of our anonymous tip process and corporate governance guidelines, including whether they are successful in preventing illegal or improper liability-creating conduct, and oversees environmental, social and corporate governance risks, ranging from the impact of artificial intelligence to diversity and inclusion to climate change. Our CC assesses and monitors whether any of our compensation policies and programs has the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking. The Board exercises direct oversight of strategic risks to NVIDIA and other risk areas not delegated to one of its committees, including business continuity and cybersecurity. Management periodically provides information, including guidance on risk management and mitigation, to the Board or a relevant committee. Each committee also reports to the Board on those matters. 27The Board and its committees have received regular reports from management regarding the impact, risks and opportunities of COVID-19 on our business, operations and people.  For example, while our Professional Visualization and Automotive market platforms were negatively affected by the pandemic, our Gaming and Data Center market platforms have benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn, and play from home.  COVID-19 has also caused volatility and disruption in global financial markets and global economic activity, and has impacted the  supply chain, including logistical services and component supply, topics on which the Board and its committees were briefed regularly.  Additionally, the Board has overseen the execution of management’s initiatives to protect the health and safety of our workforce, including closure of our offices, compliance with shelter-in-place orders and the temporary prohibition on most business travel, and to support NVIDIANs and their families during a challenging year by moving up our annual focal review to accelerate the timing of raises and implementing a one-week company-wide shut down in December for our people to recharge.Corporate Governance Policies of the Board of DirectorsThe Board has adopted Corporate Governance Policies to ensure that it has the necessary authority and processes in place to review and evaluate our business operations as needed and to make decisions that are independent of our management. The Corporate Governance Policies set forth the practices the Board follows with respect to its composition and selection, regular evaluations of the Board and its committees, Board meetings and involvement of senior management, chief executive officer performance evaluation, and Board committees and compensation. Our Corporate Governance Policies may be viewed under Governance in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.nvidia.com.Executive Sessions of the BoardAs required under Nasdaq’s listing standards, our independent directors have in the past met, and will continue to meet, regularly in scheduled executive sessions at which only independent directors are present, as well as in sessions with the CEO. In Fiscal 2021, our independent directors met in both types of executive sessions at all four of our scheduled quarterly Board meetings.Director Attendance at Annual MeetingWe do not have a formal policy regarding attendance by members of the Board at our annual meetings. We expect that our directors will attend each annual meeting, absent a valid reason.  All Board members as of the 2020 Meeting attended our 2020 Meeting.Board Self-AssessmentsIn Fiscal 2021, the NCGC oversaw an evaluation process, conducted at least annually, whereby outside corporate counsel for NVIDIA interviewed each director to obtain his or her evaluation of the Board as a whole, and of the committees on which he or she serves. The interviews solicited ideas from the directors about, among other things, improving the quality of Board and/or committee oversight effectiveness regarding strategic direction, financial and audit matters, executive compensation, acquisition activity and other key matters.  The interviews also focused on Board process and identifying specific issues which should be discussed in the future.  After these evaluations were complete, our outside corporate counsel summarized the results, reviewed them with our Lead Director, and then submitted the summary for discussion by the NCGC. In response to the evaluations conducted in Fiscal 2021, our Board determined to focus recruiting efforts on director candidates with diversity of gender and/or racial/ethnic background, to further strengthen our director onboarding programs, and to dedicate additional time to certain Board agenda items such as cybersecurity, diversity and inclusion, and other ESG matters.Director Orientation and Continuing EducationThe NCGC and our General Counsel are responsible for new director orientation and for administering or approving eligible director continuing education programs. Continuing education programs for directors may include a combination of internally developed materials and presentations, programs presented by third parties, and financial and administrative support for attendance at qualifying academic or other independent programs. Director Stock Ownership GuidelinesThe Board believes that directors should hold a significant equity interest in NVIDIA. Our Corporate Governance Policies require each non-employee director to hold shares of our common stock with a total value equal to six times the annual cash retainer for Board service during the period in which he or she serves as a director (or six times his base salary, in 28the case of the CEO).  The shares may include vested deferred stock, shares held in trust and shares held by immediate family members. Non-employee directors have five years after their Board appointment to reach the ownership threshold.  Our stock ownership guidelines are intended to further align director interests with stockholder interests.Each non-employee director and Mr. Huang currently meets or exceeds the stock ownership requirements, with the exception of Drs. Dabiri and Shah, who joined our Board in 2020 and have five years from joining the Board to reach the ownership threshold.Hedging and Pledging Policy Under our Insider Trading Policy, our directors, executive officers, employees, and their designees may not hedge their ownership of NVIDIA stock, including but not limited to trading in options, puts, calls, or other derivative instruments related to NVIDIA stock or debt to protect against a decline in the value of the Company’s stock. Additionally, directors, executive officers, employees, and their designees may not purchase NVIDIA stock on margin, borrow against NVIDIA stock held in a margin account, or pledge NVIDIA stock as collateral for a loan.  We allow for certain portfolio diversification transactions, such as investments in exchange funds.Outside AdvisorsThe Board and each of its principal committees may retain outside advisors and consultants of their choosing at our expense. The Board need not obtain management’s consent to retain outside advisors. In addition, the principal committees need not obtain either the Board’s or management’s consent to retain outside advisors.Code of ConductWe expect our directors, executives and employees to conduct themselves with the highest degree of integrity, ethics and honesty. Our credibility and reputation depend upon the good judgment, ethical standards and personal integrity of each director, executive and employee. We have a Code of Conduct that applies to our executive officers, directors and employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. We also have a Financial Team Code of Conduct that applies to our executive officers, directors and members of our finance department. We regularly review our Code of Conduct and related policies to ensure that they provide clear guidance to our directors, executives and employees.The Code of Conduct and the Financial Team Code of Conduct are available under Governance in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.nvidia.com. If we make any amendments to the Code of Conduct or the Financial Team Code of Conduct or grant any waiver from a provision of either code to any executive officer or director, we will promptly disclose the nature of the amendment or waiver on our website.Corporate HotlineWe have established an independent corporate hotline to allow any employee to confidentially and anonymously lodge a complaint about any accounting, internal control, auditing, Code of Conduct or other matter of concern (unless prohibited by local privacy laws for employees located in the European Union).Stockholder Communications with the Board of DirectorsStockholders who wish to communicate with the Board regarding nominations of directors or other matters may do so by sending electronic written communications addressed to Timothy S. Teter, our Secretary, at shareholdermeeting@nvidia.com. All stockholder communications we receive that are addressed to the Board will be compiled by our Secretary. If no particular director is named, letters will be forwarded, depending on the subject matter, to the chairperson of the AC, CC or NCGC.  Matters put forth by our stockholders will be reviewed by the NCGC, which will determine whether these matters should be presented to the Board. The NCGC will give serious consideration to all such matters and will make its determination in accordance with its charter and applicable laws.Majority Vote StandardUnder our Bylaws, if the votes cast FOR an incumbent director in a non-contested election do not exceed the number of WITHHOLD votes, such incumbent director shall promptly tender a resignation to the Board. The NCGC will then review the circumstances surrounding the WITHHOLD vote and promptly make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the NCGC’s recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date of certification of the stockholder vote. 29In a contested election, in which the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, our directors will be elected by a plurality of the shares represented at any such meeting or by proxy and entitled to vote on the election of directors at that meeting.  The directors receiving the greatest number of FOR votes will be elected.Board Meeting InformationThe Board met 10 times during Fiscal 2021, including meetings during which the Board discussed the strategic direction of NVIDIA, explored and discussed new business and strategic opportunities and the product roadmap, and other matters facing NVIDIA.  We expect each Board member to attend each meeting of the Board and the committees on which he or she serves. Each Board member attended 75% or more of the meetings of the Board and of each committee on which he or she served.Committees of the Board of DirectorsThe Board has three standing committees: an AC, a CC and a NCGC. Each of these committees operates under a written charter, which may be viewed under Governance in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.nvidia.com.  The composition and functions of our committees are set forth below.  Committee assignments are determined based on background and the expertise which individual directors can bring to a committee.  Our Board believes that rotations among committees are a good corporate governance practice which allows its members to be more fully informed regarding the full scope of the Board and our activities, and benefits each committee and the Board as a whole, as a result of diverse perspectives and ideas that are introduced through new committee formations.

We integrate sound ESG principles and practices into every aspect of the Company. The following section provides an overview of these principles and practices.  More information can be found on the Corporate Social Responsibility section of our website and in our 2020 Corporate Social Responsibility Report, which was prepared in accordance with the Core Option of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core Option and is responsive to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards for the Technology and Communications sector, Semiconductor industry. Information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Proxy Statement or any other report we file with the SEC.Human Capital ManagementWe believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our stakeholders. As of the end of Fiscal 2021, we had 18,975 employees in 29 countries. 13,532 were engaged in research and development and 5,443 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions.To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented employees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and research and development personnel. The primary ways in which we seek to do this are summarized below.RecruitmentThe demand for talent in new markets, such as AI and deep learning, is increasingly competitive. Our intern and new college graduate recruiting programs are a sustainable source of talent. We partner with higher education institutions globally to develop our candidate pipelines, recruit at industry conferences, and encourage our employees to submit referrals, with over 36% of hires coming from internal recommendations. Collaborations with our community resource groups improve how we reach and attract minority candidates.Development and RetentionTo support employee advancement, we provide training on-the-job through coaching, feedback, and role modeling. We have a rich library of live and on-demand learning experiences such as workshops, panel discussions, speaker-based forums, and internally focused technical conferences. We curate learning libraries around our most common development needs, provide the latest technical platforms to support self-paced learning, and regularly listen to learner feedback through internal messaging channels to improve and update those topics. We offer tuition reimbursement programs and subsidize advanced technical education programs and online technical certifications. We encourage internal mobility through career expos and coaching, as well as foster mentorship connections and provide trained coaches as additional developmental support. Our strong partnerships with internal community resource groups allow us to personalize programs to address specific career development needs.To evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use several listening mechanisms such as pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party hotline.In fiscal year 2021, our overall turnover rate was 3.8%.Compensation, Benefits, and Well-BeingOur compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company’s future. Employees receive equity (except where unavailable due to local regulations) with a realized value that is tied to our stock price performance and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of our stockholders.We offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ well-being, including 401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory pension programs outside the U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours and time off, and programs to address mental health, stress, and time-management challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and are committed to providing tailored benefits based on community needs, including assistance for military members, additional mental health benefits, and support for new parents, and those who wish to become parents.Safety and COVID-19We support our people and their families in making their health a top priority. We implemented global protocols to slow the spread of COVID-19 and to keep our workforce safe by closing our offices around the world in March 2020 for all except essential workers. We also eliminated most business travel. We provided our employees with resources to work 32remotely and continued to pay all employees and contractors. For essential labs and offices that remain open, we instituted appropriate safety protocols and social distancing guidelines. Additionally, we provided resources for employees, including work from home support, enhanced health coverage, reimbursement for certain work from home expenses, and learning and development resources on how to lead and manage remotely.Diversity and InclusionWe believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to a more inclusive culture that supports all employees, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, veteran status, race, ethnicity, or disability.We have increased our efforts to recruit, develop, and retain a more diverse workforce with a focus on those historically underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black, and Hispanic candidates. In Fiscal 2021, we created the role of Head of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, along with hiring a global diversity recruiting leader, and a Head of Strategic Initiatives to build our developer ecosystem and ensure it represents the global population.Efforts we are undertaking include:•Shepherding underrepresented candidates through the interviewing process, engaging employees from underrepresented communities for recruiting events and interview panels, and increased investment in minority-serving institutions and professional organizations;•Developing an internal slate of diverse talent for open management positions, beginning semi-annual talent review sessions with executives to identify internal, diverse talent, and forming sponsorship and career acceleration programs; and•Increasing inclusion communications and pulse surveys to measure employee sentimentsAs of the end of Fiscal 2021, our global workforce was 80% men and 20% women, and 6% of our workforce in the United States was composed of Black or African American, and Hispanic or Latino employees.Climate Change and the EnvironmentWe drive operational excellence to reduce our environmental impact.  Our rapid and significant business growth and the urgent climate action imperative mean that we must focus on expanding strategically, managing our operations efficiently, and sourcing low-carbon and renewable forms of energy to avoid growth in our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions footprint. After meeting our goal of a 15 percent reduction in scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, normalized per employee, from Fiscal 2014 to Fiscal 2020, we developed a new goal to source 65 percent of our global electricity use from renewable energy by the end of Fiscal 2025.We also integrate energy efficiency principles into our products.  Whether it is creation of technology to power next-generation notebooks or designs to support high-performance supercomputers, improving energy efficiency is a principal goal in each step of our research, development, and design processes.  As a result, graphics processing units (GPUs) are inherently more energy efficient than other ways of computation because they are optimized for throughput and performance per watt rather than absolute performance.Public Policy Engagement and AccountabilityOur Government Relations team engages in public policy advocacy to affect government action on issues of importance to our business, customers, stockholders, and employees, and to provide thought leadership to global governments on issues that directly affect our business. It is also a platform for educating policymakers through demonstrations of NVIDIA’s technology, amplifying our work in targeted areas, and collaborating with various organizations on issues of shared interest. We focus our public policy activities in artificial intelligence (AI), specifically to promote investment in core AI research, support workforce development around AI, and provide educational resources to technology policy advisors. NVIDIA may make expenditures to support or advocate particular viewpoints on public policy issues, including expenditures for intermediaries that advocate on our behalf if it is in our best interest.NVIDIA does not make contributions of any kind (money, employee time, goods or services or employee expense reimbursements), to political parties or candidates, including any direct contributions to any intermediary organizations, such as political action committees (PAC) or lobbyists, campaign funds, or trade or industry associations and super PACs. This policy applies in all countries and across all levels of government, even where such contributions are permitted by law.33We belong to a number of trade associations worldwide, representing the interests of the technology industry, industries in which we operate and the broader business community. These organizations work to bring about industry consensus and advocacy on major public policy issues. Where required by law, we file lobbying disclosure reports with U.S. federal, state and local governments.   Our NCGC oversees our public policy engagement and accountability.  Management reports to the NCGC about our policies and practices in connection with governmental relations, public policy advocacy, and related expenditures.NVIDIA’s policies and practices related to public policy matters, including lobbying activities, trade association memberships, and related expenditures, are available on our website at https://investor.nvidia.com/governance/governance-documents/default.aspx.34Director Compensation The CC reviews our non-employee director compensation program each year with the assistance of Exequity LLP, the CC’s independent compensation consultant, who prepares a comprehensive assessment of our program, including comparison to our Fiscal 2020 peer group used for executive compensation purposes, an update on recent trends in director compensation, and a review of related corporate governance best practices.  Following this review, the CC recommended no changes to our non-employee director compensation program for the year starting on the date of our 2020 Meeting, which we refer to as the 2020 Program.The CC subsequently recommended, and the Board approved, a mix of cash and equity awards for each non-employee director with an approximate annual value of $300,000, which was slightly below the median total annual compensation paid by similarly sized technology peer companies to their non-employee directors. We do not pay additional fees for serving as a Lead Director, chairperson or member of Board committees or for meeting attendance. Directors who are also employees do not receive fees or equity compensation for service on the Board. Cash Compensation The cash portion of the annual retainer, representing $75,000 on an annualized basis, was paid quarterly.  Each of Drs. Dabiri and Shah were paid the pro-rata portion of the annual cash retainer for service on the Board from the date of appointment to the date of our 2021 Meeting. Equity CompensationThe value of the annual equity award, in the form of RSUs, or the 2020 Program RSUs, was $225,000.  The number of shares subject to each RSU award equaled this value, divided by the average closing market price of our common stock over the 60 calendar days ending the business day before the 2020 Meeting.  The RSUs were granted on the first trading day following the date of our 2020 Meeting.To correlate the vesting of the RSUs to the non-employee directors’ service on the Board and its committees over the following year, 50% of the 2020 Program RSUs vested on November 18, 2020 (the third Wednesday in November 2020) and the remaining 50% will vest on May 19, 2021 (the third Wednesday in May 2021).  If a non-employee director’s service terminates due to death, his or her RSU grants will immediately vest in full for the benefit of his or her beneficiary.  Non-employee directors do not receive dividend equivalents on unvested RSUs.In connection with Dr. Dabiri’s appointment to the Board in July 2020, he was granted on August 10, 2020: (a) an initial RSU grant with a value of $225,000, which vests as to 1/6th of the shares approximately every six months, or the Initial Dabiri RSUs, and (b) an annual RSU grant equal to the grant value of the 2020 Program RSUs, pro-rated for the period of time from Dr. Dabiri’s appointment in July 2020 to the date of our 2021 Meeting, which vest on the same schedule as the 2020 Program RSUs, with the pro-rated amount vesting on November 18, 2020 and the remainder vesting on May 19, 2021, or the 2020 Program Dabiri RSUs. The number of shares subject to the Initial Dabiri RSUs equaled the value of the grant, divided by the average closing market price of our common stock over the 60 calendar days ending the business day before Dr. Dabiri’s appointment to the Board. The number of shares subject to the 2020 Program Dabiri RSUs equaled the number of shares that would have been granted to him pursuant to the 2020 Program RSUs had Dr. Dabiri been in service as of the 2020 Meeting, but pro-rated to reflect the period of service between the date of appointment of Dr. Dabiri to the Board and the date of the 2021 Meeting. If Dr. Dabiri’s service terminates due to death, his RSU grants will immediately fully vest. He does not receive dividend equivalents on unvested RSUs. The grants to Dr. Dabiri occurred on the sixth business day of the calendar month following the date of his appointment, in alignment with our typical grant procedures for new employees.  In connection with Dr. Shah’s appointment to the Board in November 2020, she was granted on December 8, 2020: (a) an initial RSU grant with a value of $225,000, which vests as to 1/6th of the shares approximately every six months, or the Initial Shah RSUs, and (b) an annual RSU grant equal to the grant value of the 2020 Program RSUs, pro-rated for the period of time from Dr. Shah’s appointment in November 2020 to the date of our 2021 Meeting, which will vest in full on May 19, 2021, or the 2020 Program Shah RSUs. The number of shares subject to the Initial Shah RSUs equaled the value of the grant, divided by the average closing market price of our common stock over the 60 calendar days ending the business day before Dr. Shah’s appointment to the Board. The number of shares subject to the 2020 Program Shah RSUs equaled the number of shares that would have been granted to her pursuant to the 2020 Program RSUs had Dr. Shah been in service as of the 2020 Meeting, but pro-rated to reflect the period of service between the date of appointment of Dr. Shah to the Board and the date of the 2021 Meeting. If Dr. Shah’s service terminates due to death, her RSU grants will immediately fully vest. She does not receive dividend equivalents on unvested RSUs. The grants to Dr. 35Shah occurred on the sixth business day of the calendar month following the date of her appointment, in alignment with our typical grant procedures for new employees.  Deferral of SettlementNon-employee directors could elect to defer settlement of RSUs upon vesting for tax planning purposes, to be issued on the earliest of (a) the date of the director’s “separation from service” (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)), unless a six month delay would be required under such Section, (b) the date of a change in control of NVIDIA that also would constitute a “change in control event” (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)), and (c) the third Wednesday in March of the year elected by the director, which year must have been or be no earlier than (i) 2022 for the 2020 Program Dabiri RSUs and 2020 Program Shah RSUs, (ii) 2022 for the 2020 Program RSUs, or (ii) 2024 for the Initial Dabiri RSUs and Initial Shah RSUs. Messrs. Jones, McCaffery, and Neal, Dr. Shah and Ms. Hudson elected to defer settlement of the RSUs granted to them in Fiscal 2021.Other Compensation/BenefitsOur non-employee directors are reimbursed for expenses incurred in attending Board and committee meetings and  continuing educational programs pursuant to our Corporate Governance Policies. However, we do not offer change-in-control benefits to our directors, except for the vesting acceleration provisions in our equity plans that apply to all holders of stock awards under such plans in the event that an acquirer does not assume or substitute for such awards.Director Compensation for Fiscal 2021NameFees Earned or Paid in Cash ($)Stock Awards ($) (1)Total ($)Robert K.

A non-binding vote, known as “say-on-pay,” to approve our Fiscal 2021 NEO compensation.Vote required:  A majority of the shares present or represented by proxy.Effect of abstentions:  Same as a vote AGAINST.Effect of broker non-votes:  None. In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking our stockholders to vote on an advisory basis, commonly referred to as “say-on-pay”, to approve the Fiscal 2021 compensation paid to our NEOs as disclosed in the CD&A, the compensation tables and the related narrative disclosure contained in this proxy statement. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement.In response to our stockholders’ preference, our Board has adopted a policy of providing for annual “say-on-pay” votes. This advisory proposal is not binding on the Board or us. Nevertheless, the views expressed by the stockholders, whether through this vote or otherwise, are important to management and the Board and, accordingly, the Board and the CC intend to consider the results of this vote in making determinations in the future regarding NEO compensation arrangements.Recommendation of the BoardThe Board recommends that our stockholders adopt the following resolution:“RESOLVED, that the Fiscal 2021 compensation paid to the Company’s named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED.”41Executive CompensationCompensation Discussion and AnalysisThis CD&A describes our Fiscal 2021 executive compensation goals, philosophies and program design, including the CC’s process for determining compensation, the various components of pay, and how our corporate results affected performance-based payout.  Our Fiscal 2021 NEOs were:Jen-Hsun HuangColette M. KressAjay K. PuriDebora ShoquistTimothy S. TeterPresident and CEOEVP and CFOEVP, Worldwide Field OperationsEVP, OperationsEVP, General Counsel and SecretaryFiscal 2021 Executive Compensation HighlightsDespite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, in Fiscal 2021, we enhanced our networking technologies by completing the acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd., launched the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture for our Gaming and Data Center platforms, and announced a partnership with Mercedes-Benz to introduce software-defined, intelligent vehicles using end-to-end NVIDIA technology.  On the strength of our Gaming and Data Center market platforms, we achieved record revenue for the Company, which directly impacted the performance payouts under our executive compensation program.NVIDIA’s executive compensation program in Fiscal 2021 continued to be guided by a pay for performance philosophy, and was designed to align NEO compensation with the interests of our stockholders.  The overall design of the program remained consistent year-over-year, with the following Fiscal 2021 NEO pay highlights:Components of PayBASE SALARY+VARIABLE CASH+EQUITY based on annual revenueRSUs vesting over 4 years (all NEOs other than our CEO)SY PSUs based on annual Non-GAAP Operating Income, vesting over 4 yearsMY PSUs based on 3-year TSR relative to the S&P 500, vesting after completion of the performance periodTarget Pay Adjustments Performance Achievement; Maximum Payouts•Increase in proportion of “at-risk” target pay to 94% of CEO target pay and 88% of other NEO target pay•Revenue and Non-GAAP Operating Income each adjusted to exclude the impact of acquisitions completed during Fiscal 2021•Increased CEO target variable cash to 150% of base salary (representing 25th percentile of peers)•No other changes to NEO base salary or targetvariable cash for the third consecutive yearRevenue, as adjusted, exceeded Stretch Operating Plan goalVariable cash payout at 200% of target•Target equity increased by 51% for CEO and by  111% for other NEOs, after no significant increases in the last three yearsNon-GAAP Operating Income, as adjusted, exceeded Stretch Operating Plan goal200% (150% for CEO) of target PSU shares eligible to vestIncreased Performance Goals3-year relative TSR exceeded Stretch goal200% (150% for CEO) of target PSU shares eligible to vest•Fiscal 2021 revenue and Non-GAAP Operating Income Threshold goals set above Fiscal 2020 performance•No adjustments to performance goals due to COVID-1942Our Compensation Philosophy and PracticesNVIDIA’s mission is to develop revolutionary technology that improves lives.  To achieve this vision, we must attract and retain a high-caliber executive team while balancing our stockholders’ interests.  While our CC considers numerous factors in making executive pay decisions, our compensation program is guided by the following goals and philosophies:•Pay for Performance:  emphasize at-risk and performance-based cash and equity for NEOs based on multiple  corporate metrics•Provide Competitive Pay:  NEO target compensation should be competitive with our peers; reflects job impact, scope, and responsibilities; and is structured to attract and retain talent•Stockholder Alignment:  structure NEO pay to align with stockholders’ long-term interests and make adjustments in response to feedback received through our annual stockholder engagement and our annual “say-on-pay” vote•Simplicity and Transparency:  utilize clear, simple performance metrics that are defined and reported publiclyOur executive compensation program adheres to the following practices: What We DoWhat We Don’t DoüEmphasize at-risk, performance-based compensation, with objective and distinct goals for each such componentüInclude multi-year PSU awardsüUse annual and 3-year performance targets to help determine SY PSU and MY PSU awards earned, respectivelyüRequire NEOs to provide continuous service for 4 years to fully vest in SY PSU and RSU awardsüEvaluate and adjust our program annually based on stockholder and corporate governance group feedback üMinimize excessive risk-takingüCap performance-based variable cash and PSU payoutsüRetain an independent compensation consultant reporting directly to the CCüRequire NEOs to maintain meaningful stock ownershipüMaintain a clawback policy for performance-based compensationX Enter into agreements with NEOs providing for specific terms of employment or severance benefitsX Give our executive officers special change-in-control benefitsX Provide automatic equity vesting upon a change-in-control (except for the provisions in our equity plans that apply to all employees if an acquiring company does not assume or substitute our outstanding stock awards)X Give NEOs supplemental retirement benefits or perquisites that are not available to all employeesX Provide tax gross-upsX Reprice stock options without stockholder approvalX Pay dividends or the equivalent on unearned or unvested equityX Permit executive officers, employees or directors to hedge their ownership of NVIDIA stock or to pledge NVIDIA stock as collateral for a loanHow We Determine Executive CompensationOur CC managed our Fiscal 2021 executive compensation program according to the cycle below:Nov - Dec 2019Dec 2019Mar 2020Mar 2021Apr 2021Members of management and the Board, including our Lead Director, engaged in stockholder outreachCC determined peer companiesCC determined performance goals and compensation, prior to the full onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the acquisition of Mellanox and other strategic acquisitionsCC certified achievement, excluding impacts of acquisitions completed during Fiscal 2021, and payoutsCompleted compensation risk assessment; disclose executive compensation program detailsRoles of the CC, Compensation Consultant and ManagementOur CC solicits the input of Mr. Huang and the CC’s independent compensation consultant, Exequity, which reports directly to our CC.  The roles of our CC, Exequity, and management, including our CEO, CFO, and Human Resources and Legal departments, in setting our Fiscal 2021 NEO compensation program are summarized below.43At the CC’s direction, Exequity and management recommended a peer group for our program, which was approved by the CC.  Management then gathered peer data from the Radford Global Technology Survey, which was considered by Exequity in its analysis of Mr. Huang’s compensation, and by Mr. Huang in his recommendations on our other NEOs’ compensation, for Fiscal 2021.  The CC considered Exequity’s advice, Mr. Huang’s recommendations, and management’s proposed Fiscal 2021 performance goals prior to making its final and sole decision on all Fiscal 2021 NEO compensation.  Exequity also advised the CC on the Fiscal 2021 compensation risk analysis prepared by management.  Finally, the CC also certified performance-based compensation payouts for the applicable periods ended Fiscal 2021.  During Fiscal 2021, our CC continued to use Exequity for its experience working with our CC and with compensation committees at other technology companies.  Our CC analyzed whether Exequity’s role raised any conflict of interest, considering:  (i) Exequity does not provide any services directly to NVIDIA (although we pay Exequity on the CC’s behalf), (ii) the percentage of Exequity’s total revenue resulting from fees paid by us on the CC’s behalf, (iii) Exequity’s conflict of interest policies and procedures, (iv) any business or personal relationship between Exequity and an NEO, or between Exequity’s individual compensation advisors and an NEO or any member of our CC, and (v) any NVIDIA stock owned by Exequity or its individual compensation advisors.  After considering these factors, our CC determined that Exequity’s work did not create any conflict of interest.Peer Companies and Market Compensation DataWe believe our peers should be companies that (1) compete with us for executive talent; (2) have established businesses, market presence, and complexity similar to us; and (3) are generally of similar size to us, as measured by revenue and/or market capitalization at roughly 0.5-3.5x of us.  At the time our CC determined our Fiscal 2021 peer group in December 2019, our revenue and market capitalization, compared to the median of our peer group companies, was as follows:RevenueMarket CapitalizationFiscal 2021 Peer Group Median$22.26 billion$122.83 billionNVIDIA$10.02 billion$130.47 billionAfter consultation with management, the CC determined that the existing peer group continued to be appropriate and did not make changes to our peer group for Fiscal 2021: Fiscal 2021 Peer GroupAdobe Inc.Cisco Systems, Inc.Intuit Inc.Qualcomm IncorporatedTesla, Inc.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.IBMOracle CorporationSalesforce.com, Inc.Texas InstrumentsBroadcom LimitedIntel CorporationPayPalSAPVMware, Inc.Our CC reviews market practices and compensation data from the Radford survey for peer companies’ comparably situated executives when determining the components of our executive compensation program as well as total compensation.  The CC compares the total compensation opportunity for our NEOs and similarly situated executives at the 50th percentile of peer company data, and also considers the factors below in determining NEO compensation opportunities.44Factors Used in Determining Executive CompensationIn addition to peer data, our CC considers the following factors in making executive compensation decisions. The weight given to each factor may differ among NEOs and each component of pay, and is subject to the CC’s sole discretion.ü	The need to attract and retain talent in a highly competitive industryü	Stockholder feedback regarding our executive payü	The simplicity of the overall program and the  transparency of the performance metricsü	An NEO’s past performance and anticipated future contributionsü	Our financial performance and forecasted resultsü	The need for NEOs to address new business challengesü	Each NEO’s current total compensationü	Each NEO’s unvested equityü	Internal pay equity relative to similarly situated executives and the scope and complexity of the department(s) or function(s) the NEO manages ü	Our CEO’s recommendations for the other NEOs, including his understanding of each NEO’s performance, capabilities, contributionsü	Our CC’s independent judgmentü	Our philosophy that an NEO’s total compensation opportunity and percentage of at-risk pay should increase with responsibilityü	The total compensation cost and stockholder dilution from executive compensation, to maintain a responsible cost structure for our compensation programs**    See Note 4, Stock-Based Compensation of our Form 10-K consolidated financial statements for a discussion of stock-based compensation cost.45Components of PayTaking into account (i) the Company’s Fiscal 2021 outlook at the time of determining executive compensation (which occurred in early March 2021 prior to the full onset of the COVID-19 pandemic), (ii) stockholder feedback from our annual outreach efforts, and (iii) strong Fiscal 2020 say-on-pay approval, the CC maintained the same elements for our executive pay program for Fiscal 2021, with some adjustments to further strengthen the link between corporate performance and NEO pay, including an increase to the proportion of pay that is at-risk.  The primary components of NVIDIA’s Fiscal 2021 executive compensation program are summarized below:  Fixed CompensationAt-Risk CompensationBase SalaryVariable CashSY PSUsMY PSUsRSUs (1)FormCashCashEquityEquityEquityWho ReceivesNEOsNEOsNEOsNEOsNEOs except our CEOWhen Granted or DeterminedAnnually in MarchAnnually in MarchGranted annually in MarchGranted annually in MarchGranted annually in MarchWhen Paid, Earned, or IssuedRetroactively paid to start of fiscal year, via semi-monthly payrollIf a goal is achieved, earned after fiscal year end, paid in MarchShares eligible to vest determined after fiscal year end based on performance achieved; if a goal is achieved, shares issued on each vesting date, subject to the NEO’s continued serviceShares eligible to vest determined after 3rd fiscal year end based on performance achieved; if a goal is achieved, shares issued on the sole vesting date, subject to the NEO’s continued serviceIssued on each vesting date, subject to the NEO’s continued servicePerformance MeasureN/ARevenue (determines cash payout)Non-GAAP Operating Income (determines number of shares eligible to vest)TSR relative to the S&P 500 (determines number of shares eligible to vest)N/APerformance PeriodN/A1 year1 year3 yearsN/AVesting PeriodN/AN/A4 years from grant3 years from grant4 years from grantVesting TermsN/AN/AIf at least Threshold achieved, 25% on approximately the 1-year anniversary of the grant date; 6.25% quarterly thereafterIf at least Threshold achieved, 100% on approximately the 3-year anniversary of the grant date25% on approximately the 1-year anniversary of the grant date; 6.25% quarterly thereafterTimeframe EmphasizedAnnualAnnualLong-termLong-termLong-termPurposeCompensate for expected day-to-day performanceReward for annual corporate financial performanceAlign with stockholder interests by linking NEO pay to annual operational performanceAlign with long-term stockholder interests by linking NEO pay to multi-year relative shareholder returnAlign with stockholder interests by linking NEO pay to the performance of our common stockMaximum Amount That Can Be EarnedN/A200% of target award opportunity under our Variable Cash Plan150% of Mr. Huang’s SY PSU target opportunity and 200% of our other NEOs’ respective SY PSU target opportunityUltimate value delivered depends on stock price on date earned shares vest150% of Mr. Huang’s MY PSU target opportunity and 200% of our other NEOs’ respective MY PSU target opportunityUltimate value delivered depends on stock price on date earned shares vest100% of grantUltimate value delivered depends on stock price on date shares vest(1) Our CC considers RSUs to be at-risk pay because the realized value depends on our stock price, which is a financial performance measure.              (2) Based on total target pay as approved by the CC, consisting of base salary, target opportunity under our Variable Cash Plan, and target value of equity opportunities the CC intended to deliver.46We provide medical, vision, dental, and accidental death and disability insurance as well as time off and paid holidays for our NEOs, on the same basis as our other employees.  Like other employees, our NEOs are eligible to participate in our 2012 ESPP, unless otherwise prohibited by the rules of the Internal Revenue Service, and our 401(k) plan, which included a Company match of salary deferral contributions of up to $6,500 for calendar 2020, which increased to up to $7,000 for calendar 2021.  For Fiscal 2021, Mr. Puri, Mr. Teter and Ms. Kress each received a $7,000 401(k) match, while Mr. Huang and Ms. Shoquist each received matches of $6,500. Compensation Actions and AchievementsStockholder Outreach and FeedbackWe value stockholder feedback and conduct an annual stockholder outreach program.  During the Fall of 2019, in preparing for Fiscal 2021 compensation decisions, we contacted our top institutional holders who held 1% or more of our stock (with the exception of brokerage firms and index funds who we know do not engage in direct conversations), with an aggregate ownership of approximately 31% of our common stock outstanding.  Members of management and the Board, including our Lead Director, ultimately discussed executive compensation with representatives of stockholders holding an aggregate of approximately 19% of our common stock. Our stockholders generally provided positive feedback on our pay for performance alignment and the simplicity of our executive compensation program design.After considering their feedback, and our Fiscal 2020 say-on-pay approval rate of 95%, our CC determined to maintain the same general elements and metrics for our Fiscal 2021 NEO pay program, but increased the rigor of the corporate goals and increased the proportion of “at-risk” target pay to further align pay with performance, as described below.  In the Fall of 2020, members of management and the Board, including our Lead Director and a member of our CC, again engaged in stockholder outreach.  The CC considered the feedback from these meetings in making decisions regarding the current Fiscal 2022 executive compensation program.Total Target Compensation ApproachOur CC reviewed each NEO’s total target pay opportunity and distribution across different pay elements.  Our CC compared Mr. Huang’s base salary, target variable cash opportunity, target equity opportunity, and total target pay against chief executives of our peer companies.  For our other NEOs, our CC reviewed their respective total target pay against similarly situated executives of our peer companies.  The CC also considered the factors discussed above in Factors Used in Determining Executive Compensation and the CC’s specific compensation objectives for Fiscal 2021.  Our CC did not use a single formula or assign a specific weight to any one factor in determining each NEO’s target pay.  Instead, our CC used its business judgment and experience to set total target compensation, mix of cash and equity, and fixed and at-risk pay opportunities for each NEO to achieve our program’s objectives.  When the CC set each element of pay for an NEO, it considered the context of the levels of the other pay elements, and the resulting total target pay for such NEO.  These amounts and structure allowed our NEOs to realize above-market value from equity awards and variable cash incentives only upon exceptional corporate performance.  For Fiscal 2021, the CC considered that NEO target pay had been kept essentially flat for the last three years, and made adjustments to better align each NEO’s total target pay with those of similarly situated executives at our peer companies.  As a result, Mr. Huang’s total target pay increased by approximately 46% and each other NEO’s total target pay increased by an average of 76%, with all increases pertaining to at-risk pay opportunities only.  While the CC generally made no changes to base salary and target variable cash compared to the prior year, it did increase Mr. Huang’s target variable cash to 150% of his base salary, which brought his target variable cash compensation, as a percentage of his base salary, to the 25th percentile of peer company chief executive officers.  For our other NEOs, the CC increased their respective target equity opportunities due to their increased responsibilities and scope, to better align their pay with those of peer executives, as well as to provide for retention.  Continued Emphasis on Long-Term, At-Risk, Performance-Based Equity AwardsFor Fiscal 2021, the CC decided that the largest portion of NEOs’ total target pay would remain in the form of at-risk, performance-based equity.  The CC believes an emphasis on long-term, at-risk opportunities drives results and increases NEO and stockholder alignment, while providing sufficient annual cash compensation to be competitive and retain our NEOs.  The PSUs and RSUs provide long-term incentives and retention benefits because our NEOs must achieve, for PSUs, the predetermined performance goal and also, for both PSUs and RSUs, remain with us for a multi-year period (3 years for MY PSUs and 4 years for SY PSUs and RSUs) to fully vest in the awards.47The CC concluded that, given Mr. Huang’s position as CEO, 100% of his equity grants should be at-risk and performance-based, tightly aligning his interests with stockholders.  Consistent with its practice in recent years, the CC granted Mr. Huang’s target equity opportunity 100% in the form of SY PSUs (which value is aligned with Non-GAAP Operating Income performance) and MY PSUs (which value is aligned with relative stock price performance).  For each of our other NEOs, the CC provided 40% of the target equity opportunity in the form of RSUs and 60% of the target equity opportunity in the form of PSUs.  The CC, after considering our CEO’s recommendations, determined this mix provided an appropriate balance, by placing a greater emphasis on awards contingent upon performance goal achievement while still providing a meaningful amount of time-vesting RSUs to encourage retention and to reward our other NEOs, in line with our stock performance over the long-term.  The CC evaluated market positioning, internal pay equity, individual performance, and level of unvested equity to determine a target equity opportunity value for our NEOs.  Because our CEO’s target equity opportunity value had been kept constant for the preceding three years, the CC felt it was appropriate to increase the value for Fiscal 2021 to bring that portion of pay closer to the median of peer company chief executive officers, representing an increase of 51% from Fiscal 2020.  The target equity opportunity values for our other NEOs represented an average increase of 111% from Fiscal 2020, which the CC felt was appropriate due to their increased responsibilities and scope, to bring those portions of pay closer to the median of peer company executives, as well as to provide for retention.  To determine actual shares awarded, the CC used the eight-week trailing average of our stock price ending the week prior to the date of grant, reducing the impact of daily volatility on compensation decisions.  This average stock price determined the number of RSUs and the target numbers of SY PSUs and MY PSUs. The target numbers of SY PSU and MY PSU shares were eligible to vest upon our achievement of the Base Operating Plan Non-GAAP Operating Income performance goal for Fiscal 2021, and the Target TSR performance goal relative to the S&P 500 over a 3-year period starting at the beginning of Fiscal 2021, respectively.  No shares were eligible to vest if at least Threshold performance was not achieved.   Shares underlying any PSUs that are not earned are cancelled.If the Company achieved at least Threshold performance, the minimum number of shares eligible to vest was 50% of the SY PSU target opportunity and 25% of the MY PSU target opportunity.  If the Company achieved at least Stretch Operating Plan performance for SY PSUs (or Stretch performance for MY PSUs), the maximum number of shares eligible to vest was capped at 150% of Mr. Huang’s, and 200% of our other NEOs’ respective, PSU target opportunities.  48Goals for and Achievement of Performance-Based CompensationBased on the Fiscal 2021 strategic plan as approved by the Board, the CC set performance metrics and goals, and certified the Company’s performance achievement with resulting payouts to our NEOs, as set forth below:PERFORMANCE METRICSVariable Cash PlanSY PSUsMY PSUsMetricRevenueNon-GAAP Operating IncomeTSR relative to the S&P 500Timeframe1 year1 year3 yearsCC’s Rationale for MetricDrives value, contributes to Company’s long-term successFocuses on growth in new and existing marketsExclusion of impact from acquisitions to align with stockholder interestsDistinct, separate metric from Non-GAAP Operating IncomeDrives value, contributes to Company’s long-term successReflects our annual revenue generation and effective operating expense managementExclusion of impact from acquisitions to align with stockholder interestsDistinct, separate metric from revenueAligns directly with long-term shareholder value creationProvides comparison of our stock price performance, including dividends, against a capital market index in which we competeRelative performance goal accounts for macroeconomic factors impacting the marketPERFORMANCE GOALSVariable Cash PlanSY PSUsMY PSUsFiscal 2021 Performance GoalPayout as a % of Target Opportunity (1)Fiscal 2021 Performance GoalShares Eligible to Vest as a % of Target Opportunity (1)Fiscal 2019 - Fiscal 2021 Performance GoalShares Eligible to Vest as a % of Target Opportunity (1)Threshold$12.0 billion50%$4.0 billion50%25th percentile25%Base Operating Plan (Target for MY PSUs)$12.7 billion100%$4.4 billion100%50th percentile100%Stretch Operating Plan (Stretch for MY PSUs)$13.3 billion200%$4.8 billion150% for CEO; 200% for other NEOs75th percentile150% for CEO; 200% for other NEOsPERFORMANCE ACHIEVEMENT AND PAYOUTSVariable Cash PlanSY PSUsMY PSUsPerformanceRevenue, as adjusted, of $15.0 billion*Non-GAAP Operating Income, as adjusted, of $6.1 billion*3-year TSR of 157%97th percentile of S&P 500Payout200% of target150% of CEO’s (200% of other NEOs’) target eligible to vest (2)150% of CEO’s (200% of other NEOs’) target eligible to vest (3)(1)For achievement between Threshold and Base Operating Plan (or Target for MY PSUs) and between Base Operating Plan (or Target for MY PSUs) and Stretch Operating Plan (or Stretch for MY PSUs), payouts would be determined using straight-line interpolation.  Achievement less than Threshold would result in no payout, and exceeding Stretch Operating Plan (or Stretch for MY PSUs) would result in the capped maximum payout.(2)25% of the eligible SY PSU shares vested on March 17, 2021, approximately one year after grant, and 6.25% will vest every quarter thereafter for the next three years.(3)100% of the eligible MY PSUs vested on March 17, 2021, after the 3-year performance period.*    Revenue, on an adjusted basis, is GAAP revenue, as the Company reports in its respective earnings materials, excluding the impact of acquisitions completed during the applicable fiscal year. Non-GAAP Operating Income, on an adjusted basis, is GAAP operating income as the Company reports in its respective earnings materials, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related costs, legal settlement costs and other costs, and the estimated unaudited operating income and costs associated with acquisitions completed during the applicable fiscal year.Each of the performance goal levels as described above were set by the CC with the following objectives:  •Threshold was uncertain, but attainable and high enough to create modest value; represented an appropriately decelerated payout for performance below Base Operating Plan (Target for MY PSUs)•Base Operating Plan (Target for MY PSU) was uncertain but attainable with significant effort and execution success; included budgeted investments in future businesses and revenue growth (and for PSUs, gross margin growth) considering macroeconomic conditions and reasonable but challenging growth estimates for ongoing and new businesses•Stretch Operating Plan (Stretch for MY PSU) required exceptional achievement; only possible with strong market factors and a very high level of management execution and corporate performance49At the time the CC established the Fiscal 2021 goals, the Company had executed a definitive agreement to acquire Mellanox.  However, due to uncertainty around the likelihood and timing of the receipt of required regulatory approvals as well as regarding the closing of the transaction, the CC believed that in order to best align our executives’ interests with those of our stockholders and to remain consistent with our pay for performance philosophy, the Fiscal 2021 performance goals should exclude the additional revenue and estimated unaudited operating income and costs generated by the acquisition of Mellanox and other acquisitions completed during Fiscal 2021.In accordance with the performance goals and methodology established by the CC in early Fiscal 2021, the CC excluded the additional revenue and the estimated unaudited operating income and costs generated by acquisitions completed during Fiscal 2021 in its certification of Fiscal 2021 results.  Such exclusion had the effect of reducing the overall levels of revenue and Non-GAAP Operating Income.  The CC determined the foregoing approach best aligned our executives’ interests with those of our stockholders and remained consistent with our pay for performance philosophy.  Achievement of goals for Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2021 MY PSU grants will be determined after January 2022 and January 2023, respectively.Target Fiscal 2021 Compensation ActionsThe CC’s target Fiscal 2021 compensation actions are summarized below for each NEO, reflecting the target value of the variable cash and equity opportunities the CC intended to deliver, as well as the variable cash earned and PSUs which became eligible to vest.

Our Corporate Governance Policies require the CEO to hold shares of our common stock valued at six times his base salary, and our other NEOs to hold shares of our common stock valued at the NEO’s respective base salary.  NEOs have up to five years from appointment to reach the ownership threshold.  The stock ownership guidelines are intended to further align NEO interests with stockholder interests.  Each NEO currently exceeds the stock ownership requirements. Compensation Recovery (“Clawback”) PolicyWe maintain a Compensation Recovery Policy for all employees.  Under this policy, if we are required to prepare an accounting restatement to correct an accounting error on an interim or annual financial statement included in a report on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the federal securities laws, or a Restatement, and if the Board or a committee of independent directors concludes that our CEO, our CFO or any other employee received a variable compensation payment that would not have been payable if the original interim or annual financial statements had reflected the Restatement, which we refer to as the Overpayment, then:•Our CEO and our CFO will disgorge the net after-tax portion of the Overpayment; and•The Board or the committee of independent directors in its sole discretion may require any other employee to repay the Overpayment.  In using its discretion, the Board or the independent committee may consider whether such person was involved in the preparation of our financial statements or otherwise caused the need for the Restatement and may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, recoup amounts by (1) requiring partial or full repayment by such person of any variable or incentive compensation or any gains realized on the exercise of stock options or on the open-market sale of vested shares, (2) canceling up to all and any outstanding equity awards held by such person and/or (3) adjusting the future compensation of such person.  We will review and update the Compensation Recovery Policy as necessary for compliance with the clawback policy provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act when the final regulations related to that policy are issued.Tax and Accounting ImplicationsUnder Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, or Section 162(m), compensation paid to each of the Company’s “covered employees” that exceeds $1 million per taxable year is generally non-deductible unless the compensation qualifies for certain grandfathered exceptions (including the “performance-based compensation” exception) for certain compensation paid pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017 and not materially modified on or after such date.  51Although the CC will continue to consider tax implications as one factor in determining executive compensation, the CC also looks at other factors in making its decisions and retains the flexibility to provide compensation for the NEOs in a manner consistent with the goals of the Company’s executive compensation program and the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, which may include providing for compensation that is not deductible by the Company due to the deduction limit under Section 162(m). The CC also retains the flexibility to modify compensation that was initially intended to be exempt from the deduction limit under Section 162(m) if it determines that such modifications are consistent with the Company’s business needs.Our CC also considers the impact of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, and in general, our executive plans and programs are designed to comply with the requirements of that section to avoid the possible adverse tax consequences that may arise from non-compliance.Under FASB ASC Topic 718, the Company is required to estimate and record an expense for each award of equity compensation over the vesting period of the award. We record share-based compensation expense on an ongoing basis according to FASB ASC Topic 718.Risk Analysis of Our Compensation PlansWith the oversight of the CC, members from the Company’s Legal, Human Resources and Finance departments, as well as Exequity, the independent consultant engaged by the CC, performed an assessment of the Company’s compensation programs and policies for Fiscal 2021 as generally applicable to our employees to ascertain any potential material risks that may be created by our compensation programs.  The assessment focused on programs with variability of payout and the ability of participants to directly affect payout and the controls over participant action and payout—specifically, the Company’s variable cash compensation, equity compensation, and sales incentive compensation programs.  We identified the key terms of these programs, potential concerns regarding risk taking behavior, and specific risk mitigation features.  The assessment was first presented to our Senior Vice President, Human Resources; our CFO; and our General Counsel, and then presented to the CC.The CC considered the findings of the assessment described above and concluded that our compensation programs, which are structured to recognize both short-term and long-term contributions to the Company, do not create risks which are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.  The CC believes that the following compensation design features guard against excessive risk-taking: üOur compensation program encourages our employees to remain focused on both our short-term and long-term goalsüWe design our variable cash and PSU compensation programs for executives so that payouts are based on achievement of corporate performance targets, and we cap the potential award payoutüWe have internal controls over our financial accounting and reporting which is used to measure and determine the eligible compensation awards under our Variable Cash Plan and our SY PSUsüFinancial plan target goals and final awards under our Variable Cash Plan and our SY PSUs are approved by the CC and consistent with the annual operating plan approved by the full Board each yearüMY PSUs are designed with a relative goalüWe have a compensation recovery policy applicable to all employees that allows NVIDIA to recover compensation paid in situations of fraud or material financial misconductüAll executive officer equity awards have multi-year vestingüWe have stock ownership guidelines that we believe are reasonable and are designed to align our executive officers’ interests with those of our stockholdersüWe enforce a “no-hedging” policy and a “no-pledging” policy involving our common stock which prevents our employees from insulating themselves from the effects of NVIDIA stock price performance52Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019The following table summarizes information regarding the compensation earned by our NEOs during Fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019.

If the surviving corporation does not assume, continue, or substitute such stock awards, then (a) with respect to any stock awards that are held by individuals performing services for NVIDIA immediately prior to the effective time of the transaction, the vesting and exercisability provisions of such stock awards will be accelerated in full and such stock awards will be terminated if not exercised prior to the effective date of the corporate transaction or change-in-control, and (b) all other outstanding stock awards will be terminated if not exercised on or prior to the effective date of the corporate transaction or change-in-control.57Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-ControlUpon a change-in-control or certain other corporate transactions of NVIDIA, unvested RSUs and PSUs will fully vest in some cases as described above under Employment, Severance and Change-in-Control Arrangements—Change-in-Control Arrangements. The table below shows our estimates of the amount of the benefit each of our NEOs would have received if the unvested RSUs and PSUs held by them as of January 31, 2021 had become fully vested as a result of a change-in-control, calculated by multiplying the number of unvested RSUs and PSUs held by the applicable NEO by the $519.59 closing price of our common stock on January 29, 2021.

Compensation paid in foreign currencies was converted to U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect on January 29, 2021.After applying the methodology described above, we determined the identity of our median employee for Fiscal 2021, whose compensation for Fiscal 2021 was $215,930.  Our CEO’s compensation for Fiscal 2021 was $19,316,401.  Therefore, our Fiscal 2021 CEO to median employee pay ratio was 89:1.This pay ratio represents our reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K and applicable guidance, which provide significant flexibility in how companies identify the median employee. Each company may use a different methodology and make different assumptions. As a result, and as explained by the SEC when it adopted these rules, in considering the pay ratio disclosure, stockholders should keep in mind that the rule was not designed to facilitate comparisons of pay ratios among different companies, even companies within the same industry, but rather to allow stockholders to better understand and assess each particular company’s compensation practices and pay ratio disclosures. Neither the CC nor our management used our Fiscal 2021 CEO to median employee pay ratio in making compensation decisions.Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider ParticipationAt the beginning of Fiscal 2021, the CC initially consisted of Messrs. Burgess, Coxe, Jones, and Seawell and Dr. Drell.  After the 2020 Meeting, the CC became composed of Messrs. Burgess, Coxe, and Jones and Dr. Drell.  No member of the CC is an officer or employee of NVIDIA, and none of our executive officers serve as a director or member of a compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our Board or CC. Compensation Committee ReportThe Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the compensation programs of NVIDIA on behalf of the Board of Directors. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis included in this proxy statement.In reliance on the review and discussions referred to above, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of NVIDIA for the year ended January 31, 2021 and in this proxy statement.Compensation CommitteeRobert K. BurgessTench CoxePersis S. DrellHarvey C. Jones59Proposal 3—Ratification of the Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for Fiscal 2022 What am I voting on?  Ratification of the selection of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for Fiscal 2022.Vote required:  A majority of the shares present or represented by proxy.Effect of abstentions:  Same as a vote AGAINST.Effect of broker non-votes:  None (because this is a routine proposal, there are no broker non-votes).The AC has selected PwC, which has audited our financial statements annually since 2004, to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for Fiscal 2022. Our lead audit partner at PwC serves no more than five consecutive years in that role. Stockholder ratification of the AC’s selection of PwC is not required by our Bylaws or any other governing documents or laws. As a matter of good corporate governance, we are submitting the selection of PwC to our stockholders for ratification. If our stockholders do not ratify the selection, the AC will reconsider whether or not to retain PwC. Even if the selection is ratified, the AC in its sole discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the fiscal year if it determines that such a change would be in our best interests and those of our stockholders. The AC believes it is in the best interests of NVIDIA and our stockholders to retain PwC.We expect that a representative of PwC will attend the 2021 Meeting. The PwC representative will have an opportunity to make a statement at the 2021 Meeting if he or she so desires and will also be available to respond to appropriate stockholder questions.Recommendation of the BoardThe Board recommends that you vote FOR the ratification of the selection of PwC as our independent registered accounting firm for our fiscal year ending January 30, 2022.60Fees Billed by the Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe following is a summary of fees billed by PwC for Fiscal 2021 and 2020 for audit, tax and other professional services during each fiscal year: Fiscal 2021Fiscal 2020Audit Fees (1)$ 6,283,381 $ 5,028,120 Tax Fees (2) 609,281  208,062 All Other Fees (3) 7,200  4,500 Total Fees$ 6,899,862 $ 5,240,682 (1)Audit fees include fees for the audit of our consolidated financial statements, including business combination activities during the year, the audit of our internal control over financial reporting, reviews of our quarterly financial statements and annual report, reviews of SEC registration statements and related consents, review of an SEC filing for public debt financing and related comfort letter, and fees related to statutory audits of some of our international entities.(2)Tax fees consisted of fees for tax compliance and consultation services.(3)All other fees consisted of fees for products or services other than those included above, including payment to PwC related to the use of accounting research software and an industry report.All of the services provided for Fiscal 2021 and 2020 described above were pre-approved by the AC or the Chairperson of the AC through the authority granted to him by the AC, which is described below.  Our AC determined that the rendering of services other than audit services by PwC was compatible with maintaining PwC’s independence.Pre-Approval Policies and ProceduresThe AC has adopted policies and procedures for the pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services rendered by our independent registered public accounting firm. The policy generally permits pre-approvals of specified permissible services in the defined categories of audit services, audit-related services and tax services up to specified amounts. Pre-approval may also be given as part of the AC’s approval of the scope of the engagement of our independent registered public accounting firm or on an individual case-by-case basis before the independent registered public accounting firm is engaged to provide each service. In some cases the full AC provides pre-approval for up to a year related to a particular defined task or scope. In other cases, the AC has delegated power to Mr. McCaffery, the Chairperson of our AC, to pre-approve additional non-audit services if the need for the service was unanticipated and approval is required prior to the next scheduled meeting of the AC. Mr. McCaffery then communicates such pre-approval to the full AC at its next meeting. 61Report of the Audit Committee of the Board of DirectorsThe material in this report is not “soliciting material,” is not deemed “filed” with the SEC and is not to be incorporated by reference in any of our filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, whether made before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in any such filing, except to the extent specifically incorporated by reference therein.The Audit Committee, or AC, oversees accounting, financial reporting, internal control over financial reporting, financial practices and audit activities of NVIDIA and its subsidiaries. The AC reviews the results and scope of the audit and other services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm and reviews financial statements and the accounting policies followed by NVIDIA prior to the issuance of the financial statements with both management and the independent registered public accounting firm.Management is responsible for the financial reporting process, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, the system of internal control over financial reporting, and the procedures designed to facilitate compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or PwC, our independent registered public accounting firm for Fiscal 2021, was responsible for performing an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements and issuing a report on the consolidated financial statements and of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021.  PwC’s judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of our accounting principles and such other matters are required to be disclosed to the AC under applicable standards. The AC oversees these processes. Also, the AC has ultimate authority and responsibility to select, evaluate and, when appropriate, terminate the independent registered public accounting firm. The AC approves audit fees and non-audit services provided by and fees paid to the independent registered public accounting firm.NVIDIA has an internal audit function that reports to the AC. This function is responsible for objectively reviewing and evaluating the adequacy, effectiveness and quality of our system of internal controls and the operating effectiveness of our business processes. The AC approves an annual internal audit plan and monitors the activities and performance of our internal audit function throughout the year to ensure the plan objectives are carried out and met.The AC members are not professional accountants or auditors, and their functions are not intended to duplicate or to certify the activities of management or the independent registered public accounting firm. The AC does not plan or conduct audits, determine that our financial statements are complete and accurate and in accordance with GAAP or assess our internal control over financial reporting. The AC relies, without additional independent verification, on the information provided by our management and on the representations made by management that the financial statements have been prepared with integrity and objectivity, and the opinion of PwC that such financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP.In this context, the AC reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements for Fiscal 2021 with management and our internal control over financial reporting with management and PwC. Specifically, the AC discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the SEC. We have received from PwC the written disclosures and letter required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding PwC’s communications with the AC concerning independence. The AC also considered whether the provision of certain permitted non-audit services by PwC is compatible with PwC’s independence and discussed PwC’s independence with PwC. Based on the AC’s review and discussions, the AC recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of NVIDIA for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.AUDIT COMMITTEEDawn HudsonMichael G. McCafferyMark L. PerryA. Brooke SeawellMark A. Stevens62Proposal 4—Approval of an Amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to Increase the Number of Authorized Shares of Common Stock from 2 Billion Shares to 4 Billion SharesWhat am I voting on?

Our Board is recommending the proposed increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock to provide adequate shares of common stock for general corporate purposes, as further described below.  The Board determined that the Proposed Amendment is advisable and in the best interests of the Company and directed that the proposed Amendment be submitted for adoption and approval by stockholders at the Meeting.The full text of the Proposed Amendment is set forth in Appendix A to this Proxy Statement. The Proposed Amendment would not affect the number of authorized shares of preferred stock. Currently, there are no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. Purposes and Effect of the Proposed Amendment and Effect of Stockholder ApprovalAs of April 5, 2021, we have 622,383,615 shares of common stock outstanding and the number of authorized shares of our common stock is two billion.  Following the filing of the Proposed Amendment, the number of authorized shares of our common stock will be increased to four billion. If our stockholders adopt and approve the Proposed Amendment, the Proposed Amendment will become effective on the date that it is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. If the Proposed Amendment is adopted and approved by the stockholders, the Company currently anticipates filing the Proposed Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on or around June 4, 2021. If the Proposed Amendment is not adopted and approved by the stockholders or is subsequently abandoned by the Board, the Proposed Amendment will not be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and our authorized number of shares of common stock will remain at two billion. Further, if the Board subsequently determines not to proceed with the filing of the Proposed Amendment, it will not be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware even if it is approved by stockholders. As a general matter, the increase in our authorized but unissued shares of common stock as a result of the Proposed Amendment would enable the Board to issue additional shares of common stock in its discretion from time to time for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, expanding our business through mergers and acquisitions, including shares we would be obligated to issue in connection with the pending acquisition of Arm Limited; stock dividends and/or stock splits; providing equity incentives to employees, officers or directors; and the raising of additional capital.  Such issuances would occur without further action or approval of our stockholders and would be subject to and limited by any rules or listing requirements of Nasdaq or of any other applicable rules or regulations. Except for shares of common stock reserved for grant(s) pursuant to our equity compensation plans, the Company does not currently have any other plans, agreements, commitments or understandings with respect to the issuance of the additional shares (or the currently authorized but unissued shares) of common stock, nor does the Company currently have any plans, arrangements, commitments or understandings with respect to the issuance of any shares of preferred stock.Failure by the stockholders to approve the Proposed Amendment would reduce the ability of the Board to take the potential future actions to issue additional common stock discussed above.63Any additional authorized shares of common stock, if and when issued, would be part of our existing class of common stock, and would have the same rights and privileges as the currently outstanding shares of common stock. The holders of common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or cumulative voting. Effective Date of Proposed Amendment If the Proposed Amendment is adopted by the required vote of stockholders, it will become effective on the date the Proposed Amendment is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which we anticipate will be on or around June 4, 2021.Reservation of Right to Abandon Proposed AmendmentOur Board reserves the right to not proceed with the Proposed Amendment and to abandon the Proposed Amendment without further action by our stockholders at any time before the effectiveness of the filing of the Proposed Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, even if the Proposed Amendment is adopted and approved by our stockholders at the Meeting. By voting in favor of the Proposed Amendment, you are expressly also authorizing our Board to delay, not proceed with, and abandon, the Proposed Amendment if it should so decide, in its sole discretion, that such action is in the best interests of our Company and its stockholders. If the Board elects to abandon the Proposed Amendment, the number of authorized shares of common stock will remain at two billion.Recommendation of the BoardThe Board recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the Proposed Amendment to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from two billion shares to four billion shares.64Equity Compensation Plan InformationThe number of shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, RSUs, and PSUs, the weighted-average exercise price of outstanding stock options, and the number of stock awards remaining for future issuance under each of our equity compensation plans as of January 31, 2021 are summarized as follows:Plan CategoryNumber of securities to beissued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights(a)Weighted-averageexercise price ofoutstandingoptions, warrantsand rights ($)(b)Number of securities remaining available forfuture issuance under equity compensation plans (excluding securities reflected in column (a))(c)Equity compensation plans approved by security holders (1) 2,382,757  14.40 (2) 96,439,470 (3)Equity compensation plans not approved by security holders — (4) —  — Total 2,382,757  14.40 (2) 96,439,470 (3)(1)This row includes our 2007 Plan and our 2012 ESPP.

BUSINESSOur CompanyNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, artificial intelligence, or AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, or AV, robotics, and augmented and virtual reality, or AR and VR.The GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. Today, it also simulates human intelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing capabilities, supported by up to thousands of computing cores, are essential to running deep learning algorithms. This form of AI, in which software writes itself by learning from data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered deep learning is being adopted by thousands of enterprises to deliver services and products that would have been impossible with traditional coding.NVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, software, algorithms, libraries, systems, and services to create unique value for the markets we serve. While the requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and software stacks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. The large and growing number of developers across our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases the value of our platform to our customers.Innovation is at our core. We have invested over $24 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding inventions that are essential to modern computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 defined modern computer graphics and established NVIDIA as the leader in visual computing. With our introduction of the CUDA programming model in 2006, we opened the parallel processing capabilities of the GPU for general purpose computing. This approach significantly accelerates the most demanding high-performance computing, or HPC, applications in fields such as aerospace, bio-science research, mechanical and fluid simulations, and energy exploration. Today, our GPUs power many of the fastest supercomputers across the world. In addition, the massively parallel compute architecture of our GPUs and associated software are well suited for deep learning and machine learning, powering the era of AI. While traditional CPU-based approaches no longer deliver advances on the pace described by Moore’s Law, we deliver GPU performance improvements on a pace ahead of Moore’s Law, giving the industry a path forward.Gamers choose NVIDIA GPUs to enjoy immersive, increasingly cinematic virtual worlds. GPUs also help underpin the world’s fastest growing spectator sport, eSports, which attracts hundreds of millions of viewers to watch top-quality gaming. In addition to serving the growing number of gamers, the market for gaming GPUs is expanding as a result of the burgeoning population of live streamers, broadcasters, artists and creators.Researchers use our GPUs to accelerate a wide range of important applications, from simulating molecular dynamics to weather forecasting. With support for more than over 600 applications - including the top 15 HPC applications - NVIDIA GPUs enable some of the most promising areas of discovery, from weather prediction to materials science and from wind tunnel simulation to genomics. NVIDIA GPUs power the top supercomputers in the United States and Europe. Including GPUs and networking, NVIDIA powers nearly 70%, and 8 of the top 10, supercomputers on the global TOP500 list.The world’s leading cloud service providers and consumer internet companies use our GPUs to enable, accelerate or enrich the services they deliver to billions of end-users, including search, social networking, online shopping, live video, translation, AI assistants, navigation, and cloud computing. A rapidly growing number of enterprises and startups across a broad range of industries use our GPUs and AI software to bring automation to the products and services they build. For example, the transportation industry is turning to our platforms for AV; the healthcare industry is leveraging them for enhanced medical imaging and accelerated drug discovery; and the financial services industry is using them for fraud detection.Professional designers use our GPUs to create visual effects in movies and design products ranging from soft drink bottles to commercial aircraft.4Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Pending Acquisition of Arm LimitedOn September 13, 2020, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Arm Limited, or Arm, and SoftBank Group Capital Limited and SVF Holdco (UK) Limited, or together, SoftBank, for us to acquire, from SoftBank, all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion. The announced acquisition is expected to bring together NVIDIA's leading AI computing platform with Arm's vast ecosystem to create the premier computing company for the age of artificial intelligence, accelerating innovation while expanding into large, high-growth markets. We paid $2 billion in cash at signing, or the Signing Consideration, and will pay upon closing of the acquisition $10 billion in cash and issue to SoftBank 44.3 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $21.5 billion. The transaction includes a potential earn out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by Arm during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. If the financial targets are achieved, SoftBank can elect to receive either up to an additional $5 billion in cash or up to an additional 10.3 million shares of our common stock. We will issue up to $1.5 billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $2 billion paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $1.36 billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of $0.47 billion, both with a 20-year term. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. We are engaged with regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be refunded $1.25 billion of the Signing Consideration. The $2 billion payment upon signing was allocated on a fair value basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement. We believe the closing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.Our BusinessesWe report our business results in two segments.Our Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics; vGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems. Our Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms.Our MarketsWe specialize in markets in which our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These platforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver value that is unique in the marketplace. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive.GamingComputer gaming is the largest entertainment industry. Many factors propel computer gaming’s growth, including new high production value games and franchises, the continued rise of competitive gaming or eSports, social connectivity and the demand for more content from game streamers, modders and creators.Our gaming platforms leverage our GPUs and sophisticated software to enhance the gaming experience with smoother, higher quality graphics. This includes GeForce Experience, our gaming application that optimizes the PC user’s settings for each application and enables gamers to record and share gameplay. We developed NVIDIA RTX bringing next generation graphics and AI to games. The NVIDIA RTX line-up features ray tracing technology for real-time, cinematic-quality rendering. Ray tracing, which has long been used for special effects in the movie industry, is a computationally intensive technique that simulates the physical behavior of light to achieve greater realism in computer-generated scenes. NVIDIA RTX also features deep learning super sampling, or DLSS, our AI technology that boosts frame rates while generating beautiful, sharp images for games.5Our products for the gaming market include GeForce RTX and GeForce GTX GPUs for PC gaming, SHIELD devices for gaming and streaming, GeForce NOW for cloud-based gaming, as well as platforms and development services for specialized console gaming devices.Professional VisualizationWe serve the Professional Visualization market by working closely with independent software vendors to optimize their offerings for NVIDIA GPUs. Our GPU computing solutions enhance productivity and introduce new capabilities for critical parts of the workflow for such major industries as automotive, media and entertainment, architectural engineering, oil and gas, and medical imaging. Designers who build the products we use every day need the images that they view digitally to mirror reality. This requires simulating the physical behavior of light and materials, or physically-based rendering. Our DesignWorks software delivers this to designers and enables an architect designing a building with a computer-aided design package to interact with the model in real time, view it in greater detail, and generate photorealistic renderings for the client. It also allows an automotive designer to create a highly realistic 3D image of a car, which can be viewed from all angles, reducing reliance on costly, time-consuming full-scale clay models.Our Professional Visualization platforms are critical enablers in many fields, such as design and manufacturing and digital content creation. Design and manufacturing encompass computer-aided design, architectural design, consumer-products manufacturing, medical instrumentation, and aerospace. Digital content creation includes professional video editing and post-production, special effects for films, and broadcast-television graphics.The NVIDIA RTX platform makes it possible to render film-quality, photorealistic objects and environments with physically accurate shadows, reflections and refractions using ray tracing in real-time. Many leading 3D design and content creation applications developed by our ecosystem partners now support RTX, allowing professionals to accelerate and transform their workflows with NVIDIA RTX GPUs.Just as VR is becoming more important in gaming, it is also being incorporated in a growing number of enterprise applications. Virtual car showrooms, surgical training, architectural walkthroughs, and bringing historical scenes to life all deploy this technology, powered by our GPUs.Data CenterThe NVIDIA computing platform is focused on accelerating the most compute-intensive workloads, such as AI, data analytics, graphics and scientific computing, across hyperscale, cloud, enterprise, public sector, and edge data centers. The platform consists of our energy efficient GPUs, interconnects and systems, our CUDA programming model, and a growing body of software libraries, Software Development Kits, or SDKs, application frameworks and services.In the field of AI, NVIDIA’s platform accelerates both deep learning and machine learning workloads. Deep learning is a computer science approach where neural networks are trained to recognize patterns from massive amounts of data in the form of images, sounds and text - in some instances better than humans. Machine learning is a related approach that leverages algorithms as well as data to learn how to make determinations or predictions, often used in data science. HPC, also referred to as scientific computing, uses numerical computational approaches to solve large and complex problems. For both AI and HPC applications, the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform greatly increases the performance and power efficiency of high-performance computers and data centers. We are engaged with thousands of organizations working on AI in a multitude of industries, from automating tasks such as reading medical images, to enabling fraud detection in financial services, to optimizing oil exploration and drilling. These organizations include the world’s leading consumer internet and cloud services companies, which are using AI for critical tasks such as natural language processing and recommendation systems; enterprises that are increasingly turning to AI to improve products and services; and startups seeking to implement AI in transformative ways across multiple industries. We partnered with industry leaders such as IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, and VMware to bring AI to enterprise users. We also have partnerships in transportation, retail, healthcare and manufacturing, among others, to accelerate the adoption of AI.At the foundation of the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform are our GPUs, which excel at parallel workloads such as the training and inferencing of neural networks. They are available in industry standard servers from every major computer maker worldwide, including Cisco, Dell, HP, Inspur, and Lenovo; from every major cloud service provider such as Alicloud, Amazon Web Services, Baidu Cloud, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud; as well as in our DGX AI supercomputer, a purpose-built system for deep learning and GPU accelerated applications. To facilitate customer adoption, we have also built other ready-to-use systems and reference designs around our GPUs, including 6HGX for hyperscale and supercomputing data centers, EGX for enterprise and edge computing, and AGX for autonomous machines. In fiscal year 2021, we completed the acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd., or Mellanox, a supplier of high-performance interconnect and networking products that are now part of our Data Center market platform. Mellanox interconnects are included in our DGX, HGX and EGX platforms and continue to be available on a standalone basis. With Mellanox, we can optimize across the entire computing, networking, and storage stack to deliver data center-scale computing solutions. For example, we announced a new class of processor – the data processing unit, or DPU – supported by a novel data-center-infrastructure-on-a-chip architecture, or DOCA, that enables breakthrough networking, storage and security performance.While our approach starts with powerful chips, what makes it a computing platform is our large body of software, including the CUDA parallel programming model, the CUDA-X collection of application acceleration libraries, Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, SDKs and tools, and domain-specific application frameworks. We also offer the NVIDIA GPU Cloud registry, or NGC, a comprehensive catalog of easy-to-use, optimized software stacks across a range of domains including scientific computing, deep learning, and machine learning. With NGC, AI developers, researchers and data scientists can get started with the development of AI and HPC applications and deploy them on DGX systems, NGC-ready workstations or servers from our systems partners, or with NVIDIA’s cloud partners such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, or Oracle Cloud.We also serve the data center market with NVIDIA virtual GPU (vGPU) software products that enable powerful GPU performance for workloads ranging from graphics-rich virtual desktops and workstations to data science and AI. Installed on a physical GPU in a cloud or enterprise data center server, NVIDIA vGPU software creates virtual GPUs that can be shared across multiple virtual machines accessed on any device, anywhere. With companies supporting more offsite workers than ever before, NVIDIA vGPU software products are enabling remote access to professional graphics and accelerated computing for data scientists, researchers, designers, engineers, and creative professionals across industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, architecture, and media and entertainment.AutomotiveNVIDIA’s Automotive market is comprised of cockpit infotainment solutions, AV platforms, and associated development agreements. Leveraging our technology leadership in AI and building on our long-standing automotive relationships, we are delivering a complete end-to-end solution for the AV market under the DRIVE brand. NVIDIA has demonstrated multiple applications of AI within the car: AI can drive the car itself as a pilot in fully autonomous mode or it can also be a co-pilot, assisting the human driver while creating a safer driving experience.NVIDIA is working with several hundred partners in the automotive ecosystem including automakers, truck makers, tier-one suppliers, sensor manufacturers, automotive research institutions, HD mapping companies, and startups to develop and deploy AI systems for self-driving vehicles. Our unified AI computing architecture starts with training deep neural networks using our GPUs, and then running a full perception, planning and control stack within the vehicle on the NVIDIA DRIVE computing platform. The in-vehicle platform consists of the high-performance, energy efficient DRIVE AGX computing hardware, and open, modular software, including DRIVE AV for autonomous driving and DRIVE IX for in-vehicle intelligent experience and AI assistants. NVIDIA DRIVE can perceive and understand in real-time what is happening around the vehicle, precisely locate itself on an HD map, and plan a safe path forward. This advanced self-driving car platform combines deep learning, sensor fusion, and surround vision to change the driving experience. Our DRIVE platform scales from a palm-sized, energy-efficient module for automated highway-driving capabilities to a configuration with multiple systems aimed at enabling driverless cars. Our Xavier system-on-a-chip, or SoC, which started shipping in 2018, enables vehicles to use deep neural networks to process data from multiple cameras and sensors. It powers the DRIVE AutoPilot, NVIDIA’s Level 2+ automated driving solution, combining the DRIVE AV self-driving solution with the DRIVE IX cockpit software, including a visualization system for allowing the driver to see what the car sees and plans to do.  In fiscal year 2020, we announced our next-generation SoC, Orin. In addition, we offer a scalable data center-based simulation solution, NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation running DRIVE Sim software, for testing and validating a self-driving platform before commercial deployment. NVIDIA's unique end-to-end, software-defined approach is designed for continuous innovation and continuous development, enabling cars to receive over-the-air updates to add new features and capabilities throughout the life of a vehicle.7Business StrategiesNVIDIA’s key strategies that shape our overall business approach include:Advancing the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform. NVIDIA’s accelerated computing platform can solve complex problems in significantly less time and with lower power consumption than alternative computational approaches. Indeed, it can help solve problems that were previously deemed unsolvable. We work to deliver continued performance leaps that outpace Moore’s Law by leveraging innovation across the architecture, chip design, system, and software layers. With our acquisition of Mellanox in fiscal year 2021, we strengthened our end-to-end expertise in data center architectures, positioning us for a future when the data center is the new unit of computing. This full-stack innovation approach allows us to deliver order-of-magnitude performance advantages relative to legacy approaches in our target markets, which include Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. While the requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and CUDA as the fundamental building blocks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to make leveraged investments in R&D: we can support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. We utilize this platform approach in each of our target markets. Extending our technology and platform leadership in AI. We provide a complete, end-to-end accelerated computing platform for deep learning and machine learning, addressing both training and inferencing. This includes GPUs, interconnects, systems, our CUDA programming language, algorithms, libraries, and other software. GPUs are uniquely suited to AI, and we will continue to add AI-specific features to our GPU architecture to further extend our leadership position. Our AI technology leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle. Our GPU platforms are available from virtually every major server maker and cloud service provider, as well as on our own AI supercomputer. There are over 2.2 million developers worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to help deploy our technology in our target markets. We evangelize AI through partnerships with hundreds of universities and more than 7,000 startups through our Inception program. Additionally, our Deep Learning Institute provides instruction on the latest techniques on how to design, train, and deploy neural networks in applications using our accelerated computing platform. Extending our technology and platform leadership in visual computing. We believe that visual computing is fundamental to the continued expansion and evolution of computing. We apply our research and development resources to extending our leadership in visual computing, enabling us to enhance the user experience for consumer entertainment and professional visualization applications. Our technologies are instrumental in driving gaming forward, as developers leverage our libraries and algorithms to create near-cinematic and VR experiences. Our close collaboration with game developers allows us to deliver an optimized gaming experience on our GeForce platform. Our GeForce Experience gaming application further enhances each gamer’s experience by optimizing their PC’s settings, as well as enabling the recording and sharing of gameplay. We also enable interactive graphics applications - such as games, movie and photo editing and design software - to be accessed by almost any device, almost anywhere, through our cloud platforms such as GRID for enterprise and GeForce NOW for gaming. Advancing the leading autonomous vehicle platform. We believe the advent of AV will soon revolutionize the transportation industry. In our view, AI is the key technology enabler of this opportunity, as the algorithms required for autonomous driving - such as perception, localization, and planning - are too complex for legacy hand-coded approaches and will run on multiple trained neural networks instead. Therefore, we provide a full functionally safe AI-based hardware and software solution for the AV market under the DRIVE brand, which we are bringing to market through our partnerships with automotive original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, tier-1 suppliers, and start-ups. Our AV solution also includes the GPU-based hardware required to train the neural networks before their in-vehicle deployment, as well as to re-simulate their operation prior to any over-the-air software updates. We believe our comprehensive, top-to-bottom and end-to-end approach will enable the transportation industry to solve the complex problems arising from the shift to autonomous driving. Leveraging our intellectual property. We believe our intellectual property is a valuable asset that can be accessed by our customers and partners through license and development agreements when they desire to build such capabilities directly into their own products, or have us do so through a custom development. Such license and development arrangements can further enhance the reach of our technology.Sales and MarketingOur worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets with our high-performance and efficient computing platforms. Our sales and marketing teams, located across our global markets, work closely with end customers and various industry ecosystems through our partner network. Our partner network 8incorporates each industry's respective OEMs, original device manufacturers, or ODMs, system builders, add-in board manufacturers, or AIBs, retailers/distributors, internet and cloud service providers, automotive manufacturers and tier-1 automotive suppliers, mapping companies, start-ups, and other ecosystem participants.Members of our sales team have technical expertise and product and industry knowledge. We also employ a team of application engineers to assist our partner network in designing, testing, and qualifying system designs that incorporate our platforms. We believe that the depth and quality of our design support are key to improving our partner network’s time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction, and fostering relationships that encourage our end customers and partner network to use the next generation of our products within each platform.To encourage the development of applications optimized for our platforms, we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community. Engineering and marketing personnel engage with key software developers to promote and discuss our platforms, as well as to ascertain individual product requirements and solve technical problems. Our developer program makes our products available to developers prior to launch in order to encourage the development of AI frameworks, SDKs, and APIs for software applications and game titles that are optimized for our platforms. Our Deep Learning Institute provides in-person and online training for developers in industries and organizations around the world to build AI and accelerated computing applications that leverage our platforms.As NVIDIA’s business has evolved from a focus primarily on gaming products to broader markets, and from chips to platforms and complete systems, so, too, have our avenues to market. Thus, in addition to sales to customers in our partner network, certain of our platforms are also sold through e-tail channels, or direct to cloud service providers and enterprise customers.SeasonalityOur computing platforms serve a diverse set of markets such as enterprise and cloud data centers, consumer gaming, professional workstations, and automotive. Our consumer products typically see stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. In addition, based on the production schedules of key customers, some of our products for notebooks and game consoles typically generate stronger revenue in the second and third quarters, and weaker revenue in the fourth and first quarters. However, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue. Manufacturing We do not directly manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy, whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products, such as substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing, and customer support.We utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Amkor Technology, BYD Auto Co. Ltd., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd., Omni Logistics, LLC and Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd. to perform assembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products and platforms. We use contract manufacturers such as Flex Ltd. to manufacture our standard and custom adapter card products and switch systems, and Fabrinet to manufacture our cables. We purchase substrates from Ibiden Co. Ltd., Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation, and memory from Micron Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., and SK Hynix.We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and configuration, and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, distributors, motherboard and add-in card, or AIC, customers from our third-party warehouse in Hong Kong, Israel, and the United States. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIC solutions.We also utilize industry-leading contract manufacturers, or CMs, such as Flex Ltd. and Fabrinet, and ODMs such as Wistron Corporation, to manufacture some of our products for sale directly to end customers. In those cases, key 9elements such as the GPU, SoC, memory, and integrated circuit are often consigned by us to the CMs, who are responsible for the procurement of other components used in the production process.Competition The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, including Intel’s recent announcement that they will introduce high performance GPUs, embedded SOCs, and other accelerated, AI computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect products based on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel and proprietary technologies. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in our fiscal year 2022.Our current competitors include:•suppliers and licensors designing discrete and integrated GPUs and other accelerated computing solutions, including chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics, or HPC, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, Intel Corporation, and Xilinx, Inc.;•large internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporates HPC or accelerated computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alphabet Inc. and Amazon, Inc.;•suppliers of SoC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Inc., Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung, and Xilinx or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for internal use, such as Tesla Motors; and•suppliers of interconnect, switch and cable solutions such as Applied Optoelectronics, Inc., Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Intel, Juniper Networks, Inc., Lumentum Holdings, Marvell Technology Group, and Xilinx, as well as internal teams of system vendors and large internet services companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.Patents and Proprietary RightsWe rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents have expiration dates from March 2021 to June 2045. We have numerous patents issued, allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:•the location in which our products are manufactured;•our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;•the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and•the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and regions.10We have also licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.Government RegulationsOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position, and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, employee health and safety, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods.  Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts. Human Capital ManagementWe believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our stakeholders. As of January 31, 2021, we had 18,975 employees in 29 countries. 13,532 were engaged in research and development and 5,443 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions. To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented employees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and research and development personnel.  The primary ways in which we seek to do this are summarized below, in addition to an overview of employee programs we implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.RecruitmentThe demand for talent in new markets, such as AI and deep learning, is increasingly competitive. Our intern and new college graduate recruiting programs are a sustainable source of talent. We partner with higher education institutions globally to develop our candidate pipelines, recruit at industry conferences, and encourage our employees to submit referrals, with over 36% of hires coming from internal recommendations. Collaborations with our community resource groups improve how we reach and attract minority candidates.Development and RetentionTo support employee advancement, we provide training on-the-job through coaching, feedback, and role modeling. We have a rich library of live and on-demand learning experiences such as workshops, panel discussions, speaker-based forums, and internally focused technical conferences. We curate learning libraries around our most common development needs, provide the latest technical platforms to support self-paced learning, and regularly listen to learner feedback through internal messaging channels to improve and update those topics. We offer tuition reimbursement programs and subsidize advanced technical education programs and online technical certifications. We encourage internal mobility through career expos and coaching, as well as foster mentorship connections and provide trained coaches as additional developmental support.  Our strong partnerships with internal community resource groups allow us to personalize programs to address specific career development needs. To evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use several listening mechanisms such as pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party hotline. In fiscal year 2021, our overall turnover rate was 3.8%.Compensation, Benefits, and Well-BeingOur compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the company’s future. Employees receive equity (except where unavailable due to local regulations) that is tied to the value of our stock price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of our stockholders. We offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ well-being, including 401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory pension programs outside the U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours and time off, and programs to address mental health, stress, and time-management challenges. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally and are committed to providing tailored benefits based on community needs, including assistance for military members, additional mental health benefits, and support for new birth parents, and those who wish to become parents.11Diversity and InclusionWe believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all employees, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, veteran status, race, ethnicity, or ability. We have increased our efforts to recruit, develop, and retain a more diverse workforce with a focus on those historically underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black, and Hispanic candidates. In fiscal year 2021, we created the role of Head of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, along with hiring a global diversity recruiting leader, and a Head of Strategic Initiatives to build our developer ecosystem and ensure it represents the global population. Efforts we are undertaking include:•Shepherding underrepresented candidates through the interviewing process, engaging employees from underrepresented communities for recruiting events and interview panels, and increased investment in minority-serving institutions and professional organizations.•Developing an internal slate of diverse talent for all open management positions, beginning semi-annual talent review sessions with executives to identify internal, diverse talent, and forming sponsorship and career acceleration programs.•Increasing inclusion communications and pulse surveys to measure employee sentiment.As of January 31, 2021, our global workforce was 80% male and 20% female, and 6% of our workforce in the United States was composed of Black or African American, and Hispanic or Latino employees.Safety and COVID-19 We support our people and their families in making their health a top priority. We implemented global protocols to slow the spread of COVID-19 and to keep our workforce safe by closing our offices around the world in March 2020 for all except essential workers.  We also eliminated most business travel. We provided our employees with resources to work remotely and continued to pay all employees and contractors. For essential labs and offices that remain open, we instituted appropriate safety protocols and social distancing guidelines. Additionally, we provided resources for employees, including work from home support, enhanced health coverage, reimbursement for certain work from home expenses, and learning and development resources on how to lead and manage remotely.Information About Our Executive OfficersThe following sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers, their ages and positions as of February 19, 2021:NameAgePositionJen-Hsun Huang58President and Chief Executive OfficerColette M.

The SEC’s website, http://www.sec.gov, contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Our web site and the information on it or connected to it are not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSIn evaluating NVIDIA and our business, the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. Any one of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline, and you may lose all or a part of your investment. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.Risks Related to Our Industry and MarketsIf we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or to identify new products, services or technologies, our revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted.Our GPU-based visual and accelerated computing platforms address four large markets: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. These markets often experience rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements, new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards. Our success depends on our ability to identify emerging industry changes and to develop new (or enhance our existing) products, services and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets. Such activities may require considerable technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments. We devote significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history, such as the automotive and data center markets, which presents additional risks to our business. For example, we must continue to accurately forecast demand, scale and optimize utilization in our data center business, and develop and deliver next-generation autonomous driving solutions to our partners and customers or our business could be negatively impacted. We also must continue to scale our networking business following the Mellanox acquisition by leveraging our joint product 13capabilities and continuing to effectively integrate company processes. We must also continue to develop the infrastructure needed to scale our business in these areas, including customer service and support, e-commerce and intellectual property, or IP, licensing capabilities. If we do not continue to evolve our business, including by developing market specific technologies, managing the social and environmental impact of our products and technologies, expanding the ecosystem for our current and future products and technologies, and monetizing and expanding our business in various areas, our financial results could be negatively impacted. We also must meet customer safety and compliance standards, which are subject to change, including those applicable to our automotive solutions and systems. Additionally, we continue to make considerable investments in research and development, which may not produce significant revenue for several years, if at all. If our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new products, services and technologies, or if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, our business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers, partners, and ultimately, our shareholders. If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends, or if we do not appropriately adapt our strategies as market conditions evolve, in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities, our business will be harmed.For our products that we do not sell directly to consumers, achieving design wins is an important success factor, including for our interconnect products. Achieving design wins may involve a lengthy process in pursuit of a customer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers and consumers will demand. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes. Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers. Additionally, if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards, including safety standards, our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies. Furthermore, winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as anticipated, if any.Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue.Our target markets remain extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product and/or service offerings, industry standards continue to evolve, customer needs change and new competitors enter these markets. Our competitors’ products, services and technologies may be less costly, or may offer superior functionality or better features, than ours, which may result, among other things, in lower than expected selling prices for our products. In addition, some of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities, have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, and greater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, quickly transition their products, including semiconductor products, to increasingly smaller line width geometries, and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials, which could harm our business. In our networking business, some of our customers are also integrated circuit and switch suppliers and already have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to ours. Licensing our technology and supporting such customers entails the transfer of intellectual property rights that may enable such customers to develop their own products and solutions to replace those we are currently providing to them. Consequently, these customers may become competitors to us. Further, each new design by a customer presents a competitive situation. If we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets, respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment, including in significant international markets such as China, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease, which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our results of operations to suffer. In addition, the competitive landscape in our target markets has changed and may continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation, which could lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.Risks Related to Our Supply and ManufacturingWe depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and/or package our products, which reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business.We do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility. Instead, we are dependent on industry-leading foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment 14and techniques. Similarly, we do not directly assemble, test or package our products, but instead rely on independent subcontractors. In the past we have not had and going forward we may not have long-term commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors. Nevertheless, we may enter into long-term procurement and capacity commitments as our business grows or in periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain.  As our business grows, we must continue to scale and adapt our supply chain or it could have an adverse impact on our business. As a result, we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand, scale our supply chain and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:•a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices, which could be impacted by our failure to correctly estimate demand and to place orders with our suppliers in sufficient quantities and/or in a timely manner;•a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate, or any, manufacturing or test capacity for our products;•a failure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality, leading-edge process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis;•a limited number of suppliers, including foundries, assembly and test providers, and memory manufacturers;•loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier;•a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality; and•delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ orders over our orders or otherwise.In addition, low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand, increase manufacturing costs, harm customer or partner relationships, and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results. Manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design, which is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to the foundry. Low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure. We do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem. We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements, and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner. In the past, we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products. The design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. If we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools, we could lose market share and our revenues could decline. If we fail to achieve design wins for our products, our business will be harmed.If our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our reputation could be damaged, and we could lose market share.Our products, including both hardware and software offerings, are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications, including into the automotive market, or as new versions are released. Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used by customers or the end users of such product. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Failure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers, the end product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or 15replacement costs, write-off the value of related inventory, cause us to lose market share, and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. In addition, an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins, harm our relationships with customers and partners and harm consumers’ perceptions of our brand. Also, we may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or consumers, including costs to repair or replace products in the field. A product recall, including automotive recalls or recalls due to a bug in our products, or a significant number of product returns could be expensive, damage our reputation, harm our ability to attract new customers, result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us, such as product liability suits. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.Risks Related to Our Operating BusinessIf we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed.Our products are manufactured based on estimates of customers’ future demand and our manufacturing lead times are very long.  This could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory, and make our demand forecast more uncertain. We sell many of our products through a channel model, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results. In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pent-up demand. In periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, we may place non-cancellable inventory orders significantly in advance of our normal lead times, pay premiums or provide deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply, which could negatively impact our financial results. Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, competitor announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue. For example, our GPUs for gaming are capable of digital currency mining. Demand and use of GPUs for cryptocurrency has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to change quickly. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies, can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. Additionally, consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our Gaming, Data Center and mobile workstation and laptop products and suppressed corporate demand for desktop workstations, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand, and these challenges may be more pronounced in the future if and when the effects of the pandemic subside. In estimating demand, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect. If we are unable to accurately anticipate demand for our products, our business and financial results could be adversely impacted. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include:•changes in business and economic conditions, including downturns in our target markets and/or overall economy;•changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market;•a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products;•a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;•our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products; •less demand than expected for newly-introduced products; or•increased competition, including competitive pricing actions.The cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in 16response to customer cancellations or deferrals. We could be required to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand, any of which could harm our financial results.Conversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers' orders on a timely basis. We may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. In such cases, even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged.System security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation.Security breaches, computer malware, phishing, and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years. These threats are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures. These attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future. Experienced computer programmers, hackers and employees may penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information, or that of our employees or third parties. These attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These hackers may also develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products, including consumer and automotive products, where we utilize over-the-air updates to improve functionality over time. For portions of our IT infrastructure, including business management and communication software products, we rely on products and services provided by third parties. These providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems. For example, in 2020, SolarWinds Inc., one of our third party software service providers, was subject to a data security breach. To date, our investigations of this breach, which were supported by a third party expert, have not identified any adverse impact to NVIDIA. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, such as actions by an employee with access to our systems. To defend against security threats, both to our internal systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which may result in increased expenses. We must also continue to develop security measures within NVIDIA, ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers or our business could be negatively impacted.Actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our partners, our customers or third parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability, paying damages, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business. Our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful. We may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.Business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs.Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, outages at cloud service providers, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, medical epidemics or pandemics (including, but not limited to, COVID-19) and other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events or climate change. The occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses. Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. Such risks are discussed further in the risk factor “The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.” Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. In addition, a large portion of our current data center capacity is located in California, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Israel and Korea. Additionally, a significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong, Israel and Taiwan. Geopolitical change or changes in government 17regulations and policies in the United States or abroad may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies, import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. In particular, revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments. For example, regulations to implement the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 could have an adverse effect on our business plans. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. In addition, geopolitical and domestic political developments, such as existing and potential trade wars, political or social unrest, elections and post-election developments, and other events beyond our control, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets. Political instability, changes in government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would also likely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations could be harmed if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, high heat events or water shortages, other negative impacts from climate change, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and operating results.The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.COVID-19 has spread worldwide, resulting in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the disease, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. These measures have impacted, and may further impact, our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers and our partners, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers (including our subcontractors and third-party contract manufacturers). Our critical business operations, including our headquarters, most of our finished goods inventory and many of our key suppliers are located in regions which have been impacted by COVID-19. Our customers and suppliers worldwide have also been affected and may continue to be affected by COVID-19 related restrictions and closures.The COVID-19 pandemic has increased economic and demand uncertainty. It continues to affect our business in both positive and negative ways, and there is uncertainty around their duration and impact. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, our Gaming and Data Center market platforms benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn, and play from home. Our Professional Visualization market platform benefited from work-from-home trends in mobile workstations and desktop workstation demand has started to recover, although not back to pre-COVID levels. In our Automotive market platform, COVID-19 did not have a significant impact on demand in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. In some regions, markets, or industries, where COVID-19 has driven an increase in sales for our products, the demand may not be sustainable if conditions change. Additionally, stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, particularly in Gaming, which could cause us to order an excess amount if demand changes, pay higher prices, or limit our ability to obtain supply at necessary levels or at all. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers and the availability of supply chain, logistical services and component supply may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results.The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Israel and Korea. A significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong, Israel and Taiwan. Additionally, our headquarters is located in California. Each of these countries and locations has been affected by the pandemic and has taken measures to try to contain it, including restrictions on manufacturing facilities, commerce, travel, on our support operations or workforce, or on our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of such measures and potential future measures. Such measures, as well as restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability or increased cost of air transport, port closures and increased border controls or closures, could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, mandatory work-from-home policies and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take 18further actions as required by government authorities and regulations or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. Most of our employees continue to work remotely. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed.While the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business is difficult to assess or predict, the pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to access capital or our customers’ ability to pay us for past or future purchases, which could negatively affect our liquidity. A recession or financial market correction resulting from the lack of containment and spread of COVID-19 could impact overall technology spending, adversely affecting demand for our products, our business and the value of our common stock.The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and continued spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the disease or treat its impact, availability of vaccines or other treatments, further related restrictions on travel, and the duration, timing and severity of the impact on customer spending, including any recession resulting from the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition, though the full extent and duration is uncertain.We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or investments, including the Mellanox acquisition and the planned Arm acquisition, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products. We have in the past acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, other businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products, strategic objectives and business. We completed our acquisition of Mellanox for approximately $7 billion in April 2020. In September 2020, we announced our agreement to acquire all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion. The Mellanox acquisition, the planned Arm acquisition and future acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks, and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. Furthermore, if we are unable to complete acquisitions in a timely manner, including due to delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve, making the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place which could jeopardize or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. In addition, we have made and may in the future make strategic investments in private companies and may not realize a return on our investments. Additional risks related to the Mellanox acquisition, the planned Arm acquisition and other acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:•difficulty in combining the technology, products, or operations of the acquired business with our business;•difficulty in integrating and retaining the acquired workforce, including key employees;•diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;•assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;•integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;•coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated;•acquiring business challenges and risks, including, but not limited to, disputes with management and integrating international operations and joint ventures;•difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return, if any return at all;19•difficulty in obtaining or inability to obtain governmental and regulatory consents and approvals, other approvals or financing;•the potential impact of with complying with governmental or other regulatory restrictions placed on an acquisition;•the potential impact on our stock price and financial results if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition, are required to pay reverse breakup fees or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;•failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment;•legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;•the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;•the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;•uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;•negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;•the need to determine an alternative strategy if an acquisition does not meet our expectations;•potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or company; and•impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers, as a result of our acquisition or investment.We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner network. With several of these distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels. Our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products than they did in the past, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way, particularly because:•most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, which permits our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty;•our partners may develop their own solutions;•our customers may purchase products from our competitors; or•our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products.We could also be restricted from selling our products or providing our technology and services due to U.S. trade restrictions. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, or our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. trade restrictions would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations, and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition.We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers. In the future, we may have to record additional provisions or write-offs and/or defer revenue on certain sales transactions, which could negatively impact our financial results, and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient.20We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, including adverse economic conditions, which may harm our business.We conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the United States. Our semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States. We also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the United States. We allocate revenue to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if our customers’ revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location. Revenue from sales outside of the United States accounted for 81% of total revenue for fiscal year 2021, 92% for fiscal year 2020 and 87% for fiscal year 2019. Revenue from billings to China, including Hong Kong, was 23% of our revenue for fiscal year 2021. Additionally, as of January 31, 2021, approximately 53% of our employees were located outside of the United States. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including:•international economic and political conditions and other political tensions between countries in which we do business;•unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws and employee safety and health regulations and those applicable to business acquisitions;•differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices;•local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption laws and regulations;•exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions, including deemed export restrictions, tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions; •disruptions of capital and trading markets and currency fluctuations; •increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations, such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits; and•natural disasters, public health issues (including the COVID-19 pandemic discussed further in the risk factor “The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations,” above), and other catastrophic events.If our sales outside of the United States are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may be negatively impacted.We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: IP ownership and infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition; advertising; employment; product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively. Expanding privacy legislation and compliance costs of privacy-related and data protection measures could adversely affect our customers and their products and services, which could in turn reduce demand for our products used for those workloads.Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies. Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees; prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. The technology industry is subject to intense media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to government investigations, legal actions, and penalties.Adverse changes in global, regional or local economic conditions, including recession or slowing growth, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, higher interest rates, tighter credit, inflation, lower capital expenditures by businesses including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence and spending, periodically occur. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. It is likely that the continued spread of COVID-19 will cause an economic slowdown, and it is possible that it could cause a global 21recession. Adverse changes in economic conditions, including as a result of the pandemic, can significantly harm demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions, including regarding prioritization of investments in our business. A slowdown in economic growth could have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including a decrease in demand for our products and technologies; a decrease in demand for the products and services of our customers or licensees; the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us, our inability to supply our products to our customers and/or the inability of our customers or licensees to supply their products to end users; the insolvency of key suppliers, customers or licensees; delays in reporting or payments from our customers or licensees; failures by counterparties; and/or negative effects on inventories. Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales, additional inventory or bad debt expense. Economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect our ability to manage operations and deliver our products. These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines in the value of our financial instruments.Additionally, we have engineering facilities, corporate and sales support operations and some of our manufacturing located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel and the Middle East may directly affect our business. In addition, the State of Israel and companies with business in Israel have in the past been the subject of an economic boycott and could be in the future. Other countries have in the past, and may continue in the future, to restrict business with the State of Israel and companies with Israeli operations.  Further, we are unable to ship products manufactured in Israel to certain countries.  These laws and policies may have an impact on our results of operations. Any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of such events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively. To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. In particular, hiring qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff and research and development personnel is critical to our business. We also must recruit and develop diverse talent. Additionally, changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or interpretation of such laws or regulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Additionally, competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation. The interpretation and application of employment related laws to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. We also must retain the key personnel hired as a result of our acquisitions, or it could reduce the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and negatively impact our business. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.  We continue to evolve our business practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by supporting and providing resources to our employees who are working remotely and implementing stringent safety guidelines for those who go into the essential labs and offices that remain open. If we do not continue to anticipate and address the safety and wellness needs of our employees sufficiently and/or in a timely manner, their productivity could be impacted, or we could fail to retain them.Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors. Therefore, investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance.Additional factors, other than or in addition to those described elsewhere in these risk factors, that could affect our results of operations in the future include, but are not limited to:•our ability to achieve volume production of our next-generation products;22•our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;•fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies and COVID-19, as discussed further in the risk factor “If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed;”•changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our partners’ products;•our ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive pricing;•our ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations;•product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues;•our ability to secure appropriate safety certifications and meet industry safety standards;•supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our products; •inventory write-downs;•our ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network, including by generating sales within our partner network and ensuring our products are incorporated into our partners product ecosystems, and our partner network’s ability to sell products that incorporate our technologies;•our dependence on third party vendors and end users to adopt our products, including InfiniBand;•the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments to us, and our ability to obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers;•customer bad debt write-offs;•any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities;•unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property;•our ability to maintain and scale our business processes, information systems and internal controls;•changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards; and•general macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target markets.Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results. Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility.Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Common Stock and Other MattersActions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.We have in the past, currently are, and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement. An unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages, invalidation of a patent or family of patents, indemnification of customers, payment of lost profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.We may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights. Such proceedings may increase our operating expenses, which could negatively impact our operating results. Further, we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third party’s patent or intellectual property, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s patent or other intellectual property rights. However, we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable 23to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products, we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results.Our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights that are valuable to our business. The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced. We also may face risks to our intellectual property if our employees are hired by potential competitors. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies, but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able to enforce such protections.Privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential users from using our products and services, result in liability, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings.Our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products and services with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increased security costs, damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased costs related to defending legal claims.Worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data protection, which continue to evolve and apply to our business. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which required companies to meet requirements effective as of May 2018 regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to access, correct and delete such data about themselves. Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. In addition, California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared. Violations of the CCPA carry substantial civil penalties and the law creates a private right of action for certain data breaches, which is expected to increase data breach litigation. California’s privacy laws will expand substantially effective January 1, 2023 as a result of California voters approving the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, in the November 2020 election. The CPRA will, among other things, restrict use of certain categories of sensitive personal information; further restrict the use of cross-contextual advertising techniques; establish restrictions on the retention of personal information; expand the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action; and establish the California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law, as well as impose administrative fines. Since the enactment of the CCPA, more than half of the states in the United States and the United States Congress have considered proposed privacy legislation, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States.The interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid, and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, we may be ordered to change our data practices and/or be fined. Complying with these changing laws has caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur substantial costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Further, failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity.24We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rates.As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in different jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. For example, we are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and under audit in the United Kingdom, Germany, Israel and India. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Further, changes in United States federal, and state or international tax laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows, as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the TCJA.Our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, changes in our business or statutory rates, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in available tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances, changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur, the impact of accounting for business combinations, shifts in the amount of earnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax, changes in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure, as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits. Any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.We currently and may in the future face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business on a global basis. For example, we are currently defending ourselves in a shareholder lawsuit claiming that we and certain of our officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. In addition, multiple stockholders, purporting to act on our behalf, filed derivative lawsuits seeking to assert claims on our behalf against the members of our board of directors and certain officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. In addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. In addition, the laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex and change frequently. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with changes in, or remedy violations of, these laws and regulations.Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft Corporation could delay or prevent a change in control.Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These provisions include the following:•the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval;•the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent;25•advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals;•the ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval;•a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;•the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and•the ability of our Board of Directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws.On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The Microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire.Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations.In March 2020, we issued $1.50 billion of the 2.85% Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2040, $2.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2050, and $500 million of the 3.70% Notes Due 2060, or collectively, the March 2020 Notes. In September 2016, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due 2026, or collectively, the September 2016 Notes.Our indebtedness may limit our ability to use our cash flow or borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes. Additionally, our obligation to make payments related to the Notes could impact our cash balance and limit our ability to use our cash for our capital return program and our other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other general corporate purposes.ITEM 1B.

MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURESNot Applicable.PART IIITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIESOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common stock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of February 19, 2021, we had approximately 303 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name. Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesBeginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock. Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares for a total cost of $7.08 billion through January 31, 2021. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock.The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.In fiscal year 2021, we paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends. As of January 31, 2021, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2021.Restricted Stock Unit Share WithholdingWe also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our employee equity incentive program. During fiscal year 2021, we withheld approximately 3 million shares at a total cost of $942 million through net share settlements. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion regarding our equity incentive plans.27Stock Performance Graphs The following graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return for our common stock, the S&P 500 Index, and the Nasdaq 100 Index for the five years ended January 31, 2021.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock. OverviewOur Company and Our BusinessesNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Starting with a focus on PC graphics, we extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for virtual reality, HPC, and AI. Through fiscal year 2020, our reportable segments were GPU and Tegra Processor. We changed our reportable segments to "Graphics" and "Compute & Networking" starting with the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.  Our Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics; vGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems.Our Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms.All prior period comparisons presented reflect our new reportable segments. Our market platforms – Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, Automotive, OEM and Other – remain unchanged.Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. Recent Developments, Future Objectives and ChallengesPending Acquisition of Arm LimitedOn September 13, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Arm and SoftBank for us to acquire, from SoftBank, all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion. We paid $2 billion in cash at signing, or the Signing Consideration, and will pay upon closing of the acquisition $10 billion in cash and issue to SoftBank 44.3 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $21.5 billion. The transaction includes a potential earn out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by Arm during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. If the financial performance targets are achieved, Softbank can elect to receive either up to an additional $5 billion in cash or up to an additional 10.3 million shares of our common stock. We will issue up to $1.5 billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $2 billion paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $1.36 billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of $0.47 billion, both with a 20-year term. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. We are engaged with regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be refunded $1.25 billion of the Signing Consideration. The $2 billion payment upon signing was allocated on a fair value basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement. We believe the closing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.DemandOur products are manufactured based on estimates of customers’ future demand and our manufacturing lead times are very long.  This could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or excess inventory, and make our demand forecast more uncertain. We sell many of our products through a channel model, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made 29by our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results. In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pent-up demand. In periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, we may place non-cancellable inventory orders significantly in advance of our normal lead times, pay premiums or provide deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply, which could negatively impact our financial results. Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, competitor announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue. For example, our GPUs for gaming are capable of digital currency mining. Demand and use of GPUs for cryptocurrency has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to change quickly. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies, can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. Additionally, consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our Gaming, Data Center and mobile workstation and laptop products and suppressed corporate demand for desktop workstations, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand, and these challenges may be more pronounced in the future if and when the effects of the pandemic subside. In estimating demand and evaluating trends, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect. COVID-19The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic is prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures including restrictions on travel, temporary business closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. It has significantly impacted global economic activity and caused volatility and disruption in global financial markets. Since March 2020, most of our employees have been working remotely and we have temporarily prohibited most business travel.Our Gaming and Data Center market platforms have benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn, and play from home. In Professional Visualization, mobile workstations continue to benefit from work-from-home trends, and desktop workstation demand has started to recover, although not back to pre-COVID levels. In Automotive, COVID is no longer having a significant impact on demand. Throughout our supply chain, stronger demand globally has limited the availability of capacity and components, particularly in Gaming.As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers and the availability of supply chain, logistical services and component supply may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information under the heading “Risk Factors”.We believe our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases, dividends, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations.Fiscal Year 2021 Summary Year Ended January 31,2021January 26,2020Change($ in millions, except per share data)Revenue$ 16,675 $ 10,918 Up 53%Gross margin 62.3 % 62.0 %Up 30 bpsOperating expenses$ 5,864 $ 3,922 Up 50%Income from operations$ 4,532 $ 2,846 Up 59%Net income$ 4,332 $ 2,796 Up 55%Net income per diluted share$ 6.90 $ 4.52 Up 53%Revenue for fiscal year 2021 was $16.68 billion, up 53% from a year earlier.30From a market-platform perspective, Gaming revenue was up 41% from a year ago, reflecting higher sales across desktop and laptop GPUs for gaming, and game-console SOCs. GPUs for gaming benefited from the ramp of our GeForce RTX 30 Series based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture.Professional Visualization revenue was down 13% from a year ago due to lower sales of GPUs for desktop workstations as enterprise demand was impacted by COVID. Data Center revenue was up 124% from a year ago. Revenue growth was driven by our Mellanox acquisition and the ramp of the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture. In fiscal year 2021, Mellanox revenue contributed 10% of total company revenue. Automotive revenue was down 23% from a year earlier, reflecting lower revenue from the expected ramp down of legacy infotainment modules and autonomous driving development agreements, partially offset by increases in AI cockpit and autonomous vehicle solutions.OEM and Other revenue was up 25% from a year ago, primarily due to higher volume of entry-level laptop GPUs.Gross margin for fiscal year 2021 was up 30 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by product mix with higher Data Center and lower Automotive revenue, partially offset by Mellanox acquisition-related charges.Operating expenses for fiscal year 2021 were $5.86 billion, up 50% from a year ago. The growth was influenced by the inclusion of Mellanox in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, employee additions and increases in employee compensation and related expenses. Additionally, acquisition-related and other costs of $411 million primarily include $190 million in non-recurring intangible amortization of Mellanox order backlog, $123 million in recurring amortization of Mellanox intangible assets, and $40 million related to the pending acquisition of Arm.Income from operations for fiscal year 2021 was $4.53 billion, up 59% from a year earlier. Net income and net income per diluted share for fiscal year 2021 were $4.33 billion and $6.90, up 55% and 53%, respectively, from a year earlier.Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $11.56 billion as of January 31, 2021, compared with $10.90 billion as of January 26, 2020. The increase primarily reflects the issuance of the $5 billion of notes in March 2020 and cash-flow generation, partially offset by acquisitions.We paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends in fiscal year 2021.Market Platform Highlights During fiscal year 2021, in our Gaming platform, we announced the launch of new laptop models powered by NVIDIA GeForce GPUs; unveiled GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs including our second generation NVIDIA RTX; expanded NVIDIA GeForce NOW; announced that a range of games now support NVIDIA RTX ray tracing and DLSS AI super resolution; unveiled NVIDIA Reflex and NVIDIA Broadcast; expanded the RTX Studio lineup powered by new GeForce RTX SUPER GPUs; and released DLSS 2.0.In our Professional Visualization platform, we launched mobile workstations with Acer, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Microsoft based on NVIDIA Quadro graphics for professional creators; released NVIDIA Quadro View; collaborated with Adobe to bring GPU-accelerated neural filters to Adobe Photoshop AI-powered tools; powered Autodesk’s latest 3D visualization software with NVIDIA Quadro RTX; and collaborated with many other independent software vendors to help incorporate NVIDIA RTX and AI technology in their applications.In our Data Center platform, we announced the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU and DGX A100, the first products based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture; announced more than 50 NVIDIA A100-powered systems with OEM partners and released NVIDIA-Certified Systems with NVIDIA A100 GPUs to OEMs; shared news that major cloud providers, including Google Cloud Platform, AWS, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, reached general availability of cloud computing instances based on the NVIDIA A100 GPU; announced the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD Solution for Enterprise; introduced the new family of NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPUs; introduced new products for the EGX Edge AI platform; announced a broad partnership with VMware to create an end-to-end enterprise platform for AI and a new architecture for data center, cloud and edge; powered eight of the top 10, and two-thirds of the total systems, on the latest TOP500 list of the world’s fastest supercomputers; announced that five supercomputers backed by EuroHPC will use NVIDIA’s data center accelerators or networking; and set 16 AI performance records on the latest MLPerf benchmarks.In our Automotive platform, we announced with Mercedes-Benz that the automaker will launch software-defined, intelligent vehicles using end-to-end NVIDIA technology starting in 2024; announced that NVIDIA DRIVE autonomous 31driving technology is powering a range of electric vehicles from carmakers SAIC, Nio, Li Auto, Xpeng, robotaxi-maker Zoox, and cabless truck-maker Einride; announced that NVIDIA is powering the new Mercedes-Benz AI cockpit in the first half of 2021; announced that Hyundai Motor Group’s entire lineup of Hyundai, Kia and Genesis models will come standard with NVIDIA DRIVE in-vehicle infotainment systems starting in 2022; and expanded the NVIDIA DRIVE sensor ecosystem with new solutions.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to business combinations, inventories, revenue recognition, income taxes, and goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Business CombinationsThe application of acquisition accounting to a business acquisition requires that we identify the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed and estimate the fair value of each. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition are recognized at the acquisition date, with the purchase price exceeding the fair values being recognized as goodwill. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, liabilities acquired and contingent obligations assumed requires management to make estimates. In certain circumstances, the allocations of the purchase price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions and subject to revision when we receive final information, including appraisals and other analyses. Accordingly, the measurement period for such purchase price allocations will end when the information, or the facts and circumstances, becomes available, but will not exceed twelve months. We will recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period of resolution, including the effect on earnings of any amounts that would have been recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.Goodwill and intangible assets often represent a significant portion of the assets acquired in a business combination. We recognize the fair value of an acquired intangible apart from goodwill whenever the intangible arises from contractual or other legal rights, or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. Intangible assets consist primarily of technology, customer relationships, order backlog and trade name acquired in a business combination and in-process research and development, or IPR&D. We generally assess the estimated fair values of acquired intangibles using a combination of valuation techniques. To estimate fair value, we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions, including future economic and market conditions, revenue growth, technology migration curve, and risk-adjusted discount rates. Our estimates require significant judgment and are based on historical data, various internal estimates, and external sources. Our assessment of IPR&D also includes consideration of the risk of the projects not achieving technological feasibility.InventoriesInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, failure to estimate customer demand properly, or 32unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition. In addition, cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was insignificant in fiscal years 2021 and 2020. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.Product Sales RevenueRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold along with support or extended warranty. Support and extended warranty revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.License and Development ArrangementsOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Income TaxesWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change 33based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.As of January 31, 2021, we had a valuation allowance of $728 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period.We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.GoodwillGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if indicators of potential impairment exist, using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. Our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. We changed our reportable segments to "Graphics" and "Compute & Networking" starting with the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. As a result, our reporting units also changed, and we reassigned the goodwill balance to the new reporting units based on their relative fair values. We determined there was no goodwill impairment immediately prior to the reorganization. As of January 31, 2021, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $4.19 billion and the amount of goodwill allocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $347 million and $3.85 billion, respectively. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.We performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 using a qualitative assessment and concluded there was no goodwill impairment.Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Results of OperationsA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2020, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov and at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.34The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressed as a percentage of revenue.   Year Ended January 31,2021January 26,2020Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 %Cost of revenue 37.7  38.0 Gross profit 62.3  62.0 Operating expenses: Research and development 23.5  25.9 Sales, general and administrative 11.6  10.0 Total operating expenses 35.1  35.9 Income from operations 27.2  26.1 Interest income 0.3  1.6 Interest expense (1.1)  (0.5) Other, net 0.1  — Other income (expense), net (0.7)  1.1 Income before income tax expense 26.5  27.2 Income tax expense 0.5  1.6 Net income 26.0 % 25.6 %RevenueRevenue by Reportable SegmentsYear EndedJanuary 31,2021January 26,2020$Change%Change($ in millions)Graphics$ 9,834 $ 7,639 $ 2,195  29 %Compute & Networking 6,841  3,279  3,562  109 %Total$ 16,675 $ 10,918 $ 5,757  53 %Graphics - Graphics segment revenue increased by 29% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, reflecting growth in GeForce GPUs and game console SOCs, partially offset by lower sales of Quadro/NVIDIA RTX workstations.Compute & Networking - Compute & Networking segment revenue increased by 109% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, reflecting the addition of Mellanox acquired on April 27, 2020 and the continued ramp of NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture systems and new products.Concentration of RevenueRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 81% and 92% of total revenue for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2021. Dell represented approximately 11% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020, and was attributable primarily to the Graphics segment.Gross Profit and Gross MarginGross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, and shipping costs. Cost of 35revenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing. Our overall gross margin was 62.3% and 62.0% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in fiscal year 2021 was driven by product mix with higher Data Center and lower Automotive revenue, partially offset by Mellanox acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million and ongoing intangible asset amortization of $263 million. Inventory provisions totaled $116 million and $161 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales of inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $145 million for both fiscal years 2021 and 2020. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was insignificant in both fiscal years 2021 and 2020.A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows: Graphics - The gross margin of our Graphics segment increased during fiscal year 2021 when compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily driven by product mix with lower legacy automotive infotainment revenue and higher margin mix within Quadro/Nvidia RTX.Compute & Networking - The gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment increased during fiscal year 2021 when compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily driven by the addition of Mellanox products, higher margins in Data Center compute systems, and lower product mix of certain Automotive solutions.Operating Expenses Year Ended January 31,2021January 26,2020$Change%Change ($ in millions)Research and development expenses$ 3,924 $ 2,829 $ 1,095  39 %% of net revenue 23.5 % 25.9 %  Sales, general and administrative expenses 1,940  1,093  847  77 %% of net revenue 11.6 % 10.0 %  Total operating expenses$ 5,864 $ 3,922 $ 1,942  50 %Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expenses increased by 39% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, driven primarily by the acquisition of Mellanox. In addition, the increases reflect employee compensation and related costs, including stock-based compensation, and infrastructure costs.Sales, General and AdministrativeSales, general and administrative expenses increased by 77% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, driven primarily by the Mellanox acquisition. In addition, the increases reflect employee compensation and related costs, including stock-based compensation.Other Income (Expense), NetInterest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $57 million and $178 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates earned on our investments.Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our September 2016 Notes and March 2020 Notes. Interest expense was $184 million and $52 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.Income TaxesWe recognized income tax expense of $77 million and $174 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our annual effective tax rate was 1.7% and 5.9% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. 36The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel, and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Liquidity and Capital Resources January 31,2021January 26,2020 (In millions)Cash and cash equivalents$ 847 $ 10,896 Marketable securities 10,714  1 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities$ 11,561 $ 10,897  Year EndedJanuary 31,2021January 26,2020 (In millions)Net cash provided by operating activities$ 5,822 $ 4,761 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$ (19,675) $ 6,145 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$ 3,804 $ (792) As of January 31, 2021, we had $11.56 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $664 million from the end of fiscal year 2020. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.In the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we paid $2 billion as part of the proposed acquisition of Arm, which was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $1.36 billion, the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of $0.47 billion. The cash flow allocation of the payment resulted in $1.36 billion of advanced consideration included in acquisitions, net of cash acquired, $0.17 billion for the intellectual property license included in purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and $0.47 billion in prepayment of royalties included in changes in prepaid expenses and other assets.Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, due to higher net income, higher non-cash adjustments, partially offset by changes in working capital. Changes in working capital include increases in purchases of inventory and outstanding trade receivables, both due to higher fiscal year 2021 revenue, and a prepayment of royalties to Arm.Cash used in investing activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2020, which primarily reflects cash used for the acquisition of Mellanox and the advanced consideration for the proposed acquisition of Arm, higher purchases of marketable securities, higher purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets, and lower sales of marketable securities, offset by higher maturities of marketable securities.Cash provided by financing activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to cash used in fiscal year 2020, which primarily reflects the debt issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, offset by payments related to tax on restricted stock units.37LiquidityOur primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of January 31, 2021, we had $11.56 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months, including our proposed acquisition of Arm. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements beyond twelve months. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Our marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, and certificates of deposits. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.During fiscal year 2022, we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations to fund our capital investments of approximately $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion related to property and equipment, including construction of a new building at our Santa Clara campus.We have approximately $1.38 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S. Other than that, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. as of January 31, 2021 are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Capital Return to ShareholdersIn fiscal year 2021, we paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders. As of January 31, 2021, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2021.Outstanding Indebtedness and Credit FacilitiesWe have outstanding $1.50 billion of Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of Notes Due 2040, $2.00 billion of Notes Due 2050, and $500 million of Notes due 2060, or collectively, the March 2020 Notes.We have outstanding $1.00 billion of Notes due 2021 and $1.00 billion of Notes due 2026, or collectively, the September 2016 Notes.We have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $575 million for general corporate purposes and can obtain revolving loan commitments up to $425 million. As of January 31, 2021, we had not borrowed any amounts under this agreement.We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of January 31, 2021, we had not issued any commercial paper.Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Contractual ObligationsWe have $157 million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox and unrecognized tax benefits of $395 million, which includes related interest and penalties of $43 million recorded in non-current income tax payable as of January 31, 2021. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of the effective settlement of such tax positions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.38For a description of our long-term debt, purchase obligations, and operating lease obligations, refer to Note 12, Note 13, and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, respectively.Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements.ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInvestment and Interest Rate RiskWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic growth of our businesses.As of January 31, 2021, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5%, taking into account a yield floor of 0%, would result in a decrease in fair value for these investments of $24 million, or an increase in fair value for these investments of $8 million, respectively.In September 2016, we issued $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2026. In March 2020, we issued $1.50 billion of Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of Notes Due 2040, $2.00 billion of Notes Due 2050, and $500 million of Notes due 2060. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Foreign Exchange Rate RiskWe consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2021 and 2020.Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international operations and incur expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker dollar. We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.We also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $84 million and $43 million lower as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, respectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized.39If an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of approximately $44 million and $29 million as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming the hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESControls and ProceduresDisclosure Controls and ProceduresBased on their evaluation as of January 31, 2021, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance.Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2021.The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included herein.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingOther than the acquisition of Mellanox that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting despite the fact that virtually all of our employees are working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continually monitoring and assessing the COVID-19 situation on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their operating effectiveness. We are in the process of integrating Mellanox into our systems and control environment. We believe that we have taken the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting during this integration.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of ControlsOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.40ITEM 9B.  OTHER INFORMATIONNone.PART III Certain information required by Part III is omitted from this report because we will file with the SEC a definitive proxy statement pursuant to Regulation 14A, or the 2021 Proxy Statement, no later than 120 days after the end of fiscal year 2021, and certain information included therein is incorporated herein by reference.ITEM 10.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in fiscal year 2020.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of 44management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd.- Valuation of Developed Technology and In-process Research and Development Intangible Assets AcquiredAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in fiscal year 2021 the Company completed the acquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd. for consideration of approximately $7.13 billion, of which $1,640 million of developed technology and $630 million of in-process research and development intangible assets were recorded. The fair values of developed technology and in-process research and development intangible assets were determined using the multi-period excess earnings method. As disclosed by management, management applied significant judgment in estimating the fair value of the intangible assets acquired, which involved the use of certain estimates and assumptions, including future economic and market conditions, revenue growth, the technology migration curve, and risk-adjusted discount rates.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the developed technology and in-process research and development intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd. is a critical audit matter are (i) the high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in applying procedures relating to the fair value measurement of developed technology and in-process research and development intangible assets acquired due to the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate, (ii) significant audit effort in evaluating management’s assumptions relating to the estimate, such as revenue growth and the technology migration curve, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of the intangible assets and controls over development of the assumptions related to the revenue growth and the technology migration curve. These procedures also included, among others, reading the purchase agreement and testing management’s process for estimating the fair value of the developed technology and in-process research and development intangible assets acquired. Testing management’s process included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation method and the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to the revenue growth and the technology migration curve for the intangible assets acquired, and using professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist with the evaluation. Evaluating the reasonableness of the revenue growth involved considering the past performance of the acquired business as well as economic and industry forecasts. The technology migration curve was evaluated by considering the revenue attribution between existing technology and in-process research and development based on the assessment of the separation of forecasted future revenue between developed products and new generation products and the technology carryover rate.Valuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete InventoriesAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the Company’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. As 45disclosed by management, the inventory provisions developed include assumptions about future demand and market conditions.  As of January 31, 2021, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $1,826 million.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgments by management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including developing assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, (iii) changes in technology, and (iv) comparing prior period estimates to actual results of the same period./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaFebruary 26, 2021We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2004. 46NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.Fiscal YearWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal year 2021 is a 53-week year. Fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were both 52-week years.ReclassificationsCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.Principles of ConsolidationOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. The inputs into our judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of COVID-19. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.Product Sales RevenueRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold along with support or extended warranty. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS52License and Development ArrangementsOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.Software LicensingOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with post-contract customer support, or PCS. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.Product WarrantiesWe generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.Stock-based CompensationWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, we estimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.Litigation, Investigation and Settlement CostsFrom time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.Foreign Currency RemeasurementWe use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment, and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant.NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)53Income TaxesWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.As of January 31, 2021, we had a valuation allowance of $728 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period.We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.Net Income Per ShareBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently classify our investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.We generally classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income (expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.All of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of an available-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are recognized in other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020. Marketable securities are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)54included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.Concentration of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit.Accounts ReceivableWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for expected losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We determine this allowance by identifying amounts for specific customer issues as well as amounts based on overall estimated exposure. Factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables, the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit.InventoriesInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years. Depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.LeasesWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)55when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.We combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.GoodwillGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting units. Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business. Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived AssetsIntangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology, in-process research and development, or IPR&D, and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, and acquired intellectual property. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from two to twenty years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method. We initially capitalize the fair value of IPR&D as an intangible asset with an indefinite life. When IPR&D projects are completed, we reclassify the IPR&D as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortize over the asset’s estimated useful life.Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.Business CombinationWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired, including IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income.Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)56Investment in Non-Affiliated EntitiesNon-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis only if an impairment or observable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded through net income. These investments are valued using observable and unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The estimated fair value is based on quantitative and qualitative factors including subsequent financing activities by the investee.Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsRecently Adopted Accounting PronouncementIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard to replace the existing incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates for accounts receivable and other financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt securities. We adopted the standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and the impact of the adoption was not material to our consolidated financial statements.Note 2 - Business CombinationPending Acquisition of Arm LimitedOn September 13, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Arm and SoftBank for us to acquire, from SoftBank all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion. We paid $2 billion in Signing Consideration and will pay upon closing of the acquisition $10 billion in cash and issue to SoftBank 44.3 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $21.5 billion. The transaction includes a potential earn out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by Arm during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. If the financial targets are achieved, SoftBank can elect to receive either up to an additional $5 billion in cash or up to an additional 10.3 million shares of our common stock. We will issue up to $1.5 billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $2 billion paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $1.36 billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of $0.47 billion, both with a 20-year term. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. We are engaged with regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be refunded $1.25 billion of the Signing Consideration. The $2 billion payment upon signing was allocated on a fair value basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement. We believe the closing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.On April 27, 2020, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Mellanox for a total purchase consideration of $7.13 billion. Mellanox is a supplier of high-performance interconnect products for computing, storage and communications applications. We acquired Mellanox to optimize data center workloads to scale across the entire computing, networking, and storage stack.NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)57Purchase Price AllocationThe aggregate purchase consideration has been allocated as follows (in millions):Purchase PriceCash paid for outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares (1)$ 7,033 Cash for Mellanox equity awards (2) 16 Total cash consideration 7,049 Fair value of Mellanox equity awards assumed by NVIDIA (3) 85 Total purchase consideration$ 7,134 AllocationCash and cash equivalents$ 115 Marketable securities 699 Accounts receivable, net 216 Inventories 320 Prepaid expenses and other assets 179 Property and equipment, net 144 Goodwill 3,431 Intangible assets 2,970 Accounts payable (136) Accrued and other current liabilities (236) Income tax liability (191) Deferred income tax liability (258) Other long-term liabilities (119) $ 7,134 (1) Represents the cash consideration of $125.00 per share paid to Mellanox shareholders for approximately 56 million shares of outstanding Mellanox ordinary shares. (2) Represents the cash consideration for the settlement of approximately 249 thousand Mellanox stock options held by employees and non-employee directors of Mellanox.(3) Represents the fair value of Mellanox’s stock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination services.We allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair values.The goodwill is primarily attributable to the planned growth in the combined business of NVIDIA and Mellanox. Goodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any interim indicators of impairment. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition is not expected to be deductible for foreign tax purposes. Goodwill arising from the Mellanox acquisition has been allocated to the Compute and Networking segment. Refer to Note 17 – Segment Information for further details on segments.The operating results of Mellanox have been included in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021 since the acquisition date of April 27, 2020. Revenue attributable to Mellanox was approximately 10% for fiscal year 2021. There is not a practical way to determine net income attributable to Mellanox due to integration. Acquisition-related costs attributable to Mellanox of $28 million were included in selling, general and administrative expense for fiscal year 2021.NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)58Intangible AssetsThe estimated fair value and useful life of the acquired intangible assets are as follows:Fair ValueUseful Lives(In millions)Developed technology (1)$ 1,640 5 yearsCustomer relationships (2) 440 3 yearsOrder backlog (3) 190 Based on actual shipmentsTrade names (4) 70 5 yearsTotal identified finite-lived intangible assets 2,340 IPR&D (5) 630 N/ATotal identified intangible assets$ 2,970 (1) The fair value of developed technology was identified using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method.(2) Customer relationships represent the fair value of the existing relationships using the With and Without Method.(3) Order backlog represents primarily the fair value of purchase arrangements with customers using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method. The intangible asset was fully amortized as of January 31, 2021.(4) Trade names primarily relate to Mellanox trade names and fair value was determined by applying the Relief-from-Royalty Method under the income approach.(5) The fair value of IPR&D was determined using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method.The fair value of the finite-lived intangible assets will be amortized over the estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be received to cost of revenue and operating expenses. Mellanox had an IPR&D project associated with the next generation interconnect product that had not yet reached technological feasibility as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, we recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset of $630 million for the fair value of this project, which will initially not be amortized. Instead, the project will be tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the project may be impaired or may have reached technological feasibility. Once the project reaches technological feasibility, we will begin to amortize the intangible asset over its estimated useful life.Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma InformationThe following unaudited pro forma financial information summarizes the combined results of operations for NVIDIA and Mellanox as if the companies were combined as of the beginning of fiscal year 2020: Pro Forma Year Ended January 31,2021January 26,2020(In millions)Revenue$ 17,104 $ 12,250 Net income$ 4,757 $ 2,114 The unaudited pro forma information includes adjustments related to amortization of acquired intangible assets, adjustments to stock-based compensation expense, fair value of acquired inventory, and transaction costs. The unaudited pro forma information presented above is for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations of the combined business had the acquisition actually occurred at the beginning of fiscal year 2020 or of the results of our future operations of the combined businesses.The pro forma results reflect the inventory step-up expense of $161 million in the fiscal year 2020 and were excluded from the pro forma results for fiscal year 2021. There were no other material nonrecurring adjustments.NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)59Note 3 - LeasesOn January 28, 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard using the optional transition method.Our lease obligations primarily consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and international office facilities, and data center space, with lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2022 and 2035.Future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases as of January 31, 2021, are as follows: Operating Lease Obligations (In millions)Fiscal Year: 2022$ 152 2023 135 2024 115 2025 94 2026 86 2027 and thereafter 288 Total 870 Less imputed interest 115 Present value of net future minimum lease payments 755 Less short-term operating lease liabilities 121 Long-term operating lease liabilities$ 634 Operating lease expense for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $145 million, $114 million, $80 million, respectively.

This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.5 years for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, and 0.9 years for ESPP.The fair value of shares issued under our ESPP have been estimated with the following assumptions: Year Ended January 31,2021January 26,2020January 27,2019(Using the Black-Scholes model)ESPPWeighted average expected life (in years)0.1-2.00.1-2.00.1-2.0Risk-free interest rate0.1%-1.6%1.5%-2.6%1.6%-2.8%Volatility26%-89%30%-82%24%-75%Dividend yield0.1%-0.3%0.3%-0.4%0.3%-0.4%For ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the purchase date. The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest rates on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield.NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)61Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures semi-annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience.Equity Incentive ProgramWe grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the following equity incentive plans. In addition, in connection with our acquisitions of various companies, we have assumed the stock-based awards granted under their stock incentive plans and substituted them with our RSUs.Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive PlanIn 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and restated, the 2007 Plan.The 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awards to employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. As of January 31, 2021, up to 244 million shares of our common stock could be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan, of which 2 million shares were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. All options are fully vested, the last of which will expire by May 2024 if not exercised. Currently, we grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 31, 2021, there were 37 million shares available for future issuance.Subject to certain exceptions, RSUs and PSUs granted to employees either vest (A) over a four-year period, subject to continued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter, or (B) over a three-year period, subject to continued service, with 40% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 7.5% vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100% on approximately the three-year anniversary of the date of grant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally determined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria.Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase PlanIn 2012, our shareholders approved the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently amended and restated, the 2012 Plan.Employees who participate may have up to 10% of their earnings withheld to the purchase of shares of common stock. Starting in March 2021, employees who participate may have up to 15% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of common stock. The Board may decrease this percentage at its discretion. Each offering period is approximately 24 months, which is generally divided into four purchase periods of six months. The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering period and the fair market value on each purchase date within the offering. As of January 31, 2021, we had 60 million shares reserved for future issuance under the 2012 Plan.NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)62Equity Award ActivityThe following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans: RSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs Outstanding Number of SharesWeighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value(In millions, except years and per share data)Balances, January 26, 2020 14 $ 176.72 Granted 9 $ 307.25 Vested restricted stock (7) $ 159.35 Canceled and forfeited (1) $ 193.83 Balances, January 31, 2021 15 $ 264.69 Vested and expected to vest after January 31, 2021 14 $ 264.13 As of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, there were 37 million and 29 million shares, respectively, of common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans. As of January 31, 2021, the total intrinsic value of options currently exercisable and outstanding was $1.20 billion, with an average exercise price of $14.40 per share and an average remaining term of 1.7 years. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $521 million, $84 million, and $180 million for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Upon the exercise of an option, we issue new shares of stock. The total fair value of RSUs and PSUs, as of their respective vesting dates, during the years ended January 31, 2021, January 26, 2020, and January 27, 2019, was $2.67 billion, $1.45 billion, and $2.62 billion, respectively.Note 5 - Net Income Per ShareThe following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented: Year Ended January 31,2021January 26,2020January 27,2019 (In millions, except per share data)Numerator:   Net income$ 4,332 $ 2,796 $ 4,141 Denominator:   Basic weighted average shares 617  609  608 Dilutive impact of outstanding equity awards 11  9  17 Diluted weighted average shares 628  618  625 Net income per share:   Basic (1)$ 7.02 $ 4.59 $ 6.81 Diluted (2)$ 6.90 $ 4.52 $ 6.63 Equity awards excluded from diluted net income per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive 3  11  5 (1) Calculated as net income divided by basic weighted average shares.(2) Calculated as net income divided by diluted weighted average shares.NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)63Note 6 - GoodwillWe changed our reportable segments to "Graphics" and "Compute & Networking" starting with the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, as discussed in Note 17 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, our reporting units also changed, and we reassigned the goodwill balance to the new reporting units based on their relative fair values. Comparative periods presented reflect this change. We determined there was no goodwill impairment immediately prior to the reorganization. As of January 31, 2021, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $4.19 billion and the amount of goodwill allocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $347 million and $3.85 billion, respectively. As of January 26, 2020, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $618 million and the amount of goodwill allocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $347 million and $271 million, respectively. Goodwill increased by $3.57 billion in fiscal year 2021 due to goodwill of $3.43 billion arising from the Mellanox acquisition, and goodwill of $143 million from other acquisition activities, all of which were allocated to the Compute & Networking reporting unit. During the fourth quarters of fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, we completed our annual impairment tests and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years.

This includes related deferred revenue currently recorded and amounts that will be invoiced in future periods. As of January 31, 2021, the amount of our remaining performance that has not been recognized as revenue was $683 million, of which we expect to recognize approximately 44% as revenue over the next twelve months and the remainder thereafter. This amount excludes the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.Note 11 - Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020.We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020:January 31,2021January 26,2020 (In millions)Designated as cash flow hedges$ 840 $ 428 Not designated for hedge accounting$ 441 $ 287 As of January 31, 2021, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months.

Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.Note 12 - DebtLong-Term DebtIn March 2020, we issued $1.50 billion of the 2.85% Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2040, $2.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2050, and $500 million of the 3.70% Notes Due 2060, or collectively, the March 2020 Notes. Interest on the March 2020 Notes is payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2020. Upon 30 days' notice to holders of the Notes, we may redeem the Notes for cash prior to maturity, at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a make-whole premium. However, no make-whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2030 on or after January 1, 2030, the Notes Due 2040 on or after October 1, 2039, the Notes Due 2050 on or after October 1, 2049, or the Notes Due 2060 on or after October 1, 2059. The net proceeds from the March 2020 Notes were $4.97 billion, after deducting debt discount and issuance costs.In September 2016, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021, and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due 2026, or collectively, the September 2016 Notes. Interest on the September 2016 Notes is payable on March 16 and September 16 of each year. Upon 30 days' notice to holders of the Notes, we may redeem the Notes for cash prior to maturity, at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a make-whole premium. However, no make-whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2021 on or after August 16, 2021, or for redemptions of the Notes Due 2026 on or after June 16, 2026. The net proceeds from the September 2016 Notes were $1.98 billion, after deducting debt discount and issuance costs.NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)69Both the September 2016 Notes and the March 2020 Notes, or collectively, the Notes, are our unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes.The carrying value of the Notes and the associated interest rates were as follows:   ExpectedRemaining Term (years) EffectiveInterest Rate January 31,2021January 26,2020      (In millions)2.20% Notes Due 2021 0.6 2.38% $ 1,000 $ 1,000 3.20% Notes Due 2026 5.6 3.31%  1,000  1,000 2.85% Notes Due 20309.22.93% 1,500  — 3.50% Notes Due 204019.23.54% 1,000  — 3.50% Notes Due 205029.23.54% 2,000  — 3.70% Notes Due 206039.23.73% 500  — Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs      (37)  (9) Net carrying amount      6,963  1,991 Less short-term portion (999)  — Total long-term portion$ 5,964 $ 1,991 As of January 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the required covenants under the Notes.Credit FacilitiesWe have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $575 million for general corporate purposes and can obtain revolving loan commitments up to $425 million.

We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability for such indemnifications.LitigationSecurities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits The plaintiffs in the putative securities class action lawsuit, captioned 4:18-cv-07669-HSG, initially filed on December 21, 2018 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)70Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2020. The amended complaint asserts that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also allege that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs seek class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On June 29, 2020, NVIDIA moved to dismiss the amended complaint on the basis that plaintiffs failed to state any claims for violations of the securities laws by NVIDIA or the individual defendants. As of September 14, 2020, the motion was fully briefed but the Court has not yet issued a decision.The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, remains stayed pending resolution of NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures.The putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures.It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations received from shareholders, with respect to these same or other matters, naming NVIDIA and/or its officers and directors as defendants.Accounting for Loss Contingencies As of January 31, 2021, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)71Note 14 - Income TaxesThe income tax expense (benefit) applicable to income before income taxes consists of the following: Year Ended January 31,2021January 26,2020January 27,2019 (In millions)Current income taxes:   Federal$ 197 $ 65 $ 1 State 1  4  — Foreign 161  87  69 Total current 359  156  70 Deferred taxes:   Federal (246)  2  (315) Foreign (36)  16  — Total deferred (282)  18  (315) Income tax expense (benefit)$ 77 $ 174 $ (245) Income before income tax consists of the following: Year Ended January 31,2021January 26,2020January 27,2019 (In millions)Domestic$ 1,437 $ 620 $ 1,843 Foreign 2,972  2,350  2,053 Income before income tax$ 4,409 $ 2,970 $ 3,896 The income tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% to income before income taxes as follows: Year Ended January 31,2021January 26,2020January 27,2019 (In millions)Tax expense computed at federal statutory rate$ 926 $ 624 $ 818 Expense (benefit) resulting from:State income taxes, net of federal tax effect 10  12  23 Foreign tax rate differential (561)  (301)  (412) U.S. federal R&D tax credit (173)  (110)  (141) Stock-based compensation (136)  (60)  (191) Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 —  —  (368) Other 11  9  26 Income tax expense (benefit)$ 77 $ 174 $ (245)     NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)72The tax effect of temporary differences that gives rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented below:  January 31,2021January 26,2020 (In millions)Deferred tax assets: GILTI deferred tax assets$ 709 $ 428 Research and other tax credit carryforwards 650  605 Operating lease liabilities 120  114 Net operating loss carryforwards 100  62 Accruals and reserves, not currently deductible for tax purposes 59  39 Stock-based compensation 36  28 Property, equipment and intangible assets 32  12 Gross deferred tax assets 1,706  1,288 Less valuation allowance (728)  (621) Total deferred tax assets 978  667 Deferred tax liabilities:  Acquired intangibles (191)  (1) Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries (111)  (40) Operating lease assets (111)  (107) Gross deferred tax liabilities (413)  (148) Net deferred tax asset (1)$ 565 $ 519 (1)  Net deferred tax asset includes long-term deferred tax assets of $806 million and $548 million and long-term deferred tax liabilities of $241 million and $29 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Long-term deferred tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recognized an income tax expense of $77 million and $174 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, and income tax benefit of $245 million for fiscal year 2019. Our annual effective tax rate was 1.7%, 5.9%, and (6.3)% for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to an absence of tax benefits related to the enactment of the TCJA and a decrease of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA in 2019.During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we completed the acquisition of Mellanox. As a result of the acquisition, we recorded $256 million of net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of the acquired intangible assets and undistributed earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries. We also recorded $153 million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox. The net deferred tax liabilities and long-term tax liabilities are based upon certain assumptions underlying our purchase price allocation. As a result of the acquisition, as of January 31, 2021, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $1.16 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings held by Mellanox non-U.S. subsidiaries. We have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to investments in Mellanox non-U.S. subsidiaries as the determination of such amount is not practicable.As of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, we had a valuation allowance of $728 million and $621 million, respectively, related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)73assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.As of January 31, 2021, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $333 million, $308 million and $344 million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023 and 2022, respectively. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $344 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 31, 2021, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $238 million that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2035. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $987 million, of which $944 million is attributable to the State of California and may be carried over indefinitely, and $43 million is attributable to various other states and will begin to expire in fiscal year 2022. Our tax attributes, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilization of federal, state, and foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may also be subject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the federal, state, or foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, as applicable, may expire or be denied before utilization.As of January 31, 2021, we had $776 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $606 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized. However, $132 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions taken, that, if recognized, would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance. The $606 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 31, 2021 consisted of $352 million recorded in non-current income taxes payable, $5 million recorded in current income taxes payable, and $249 million reflected as a reduction to the related deferred tax assets.A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: January 31,2021January 26,2020January 27,2019 (In millions)Balance at beginning of period$ 583 $ 477 $ 447 Increases in tax positions for current year 158  104  129 Increases in tax positions for prior years (1) 60  7  52 Decreases in tax positions for prior years (11)  —  (141) Settlements (5)  —  — Lapse in statute of limitations (9)  (5)  (10) Balance at end of period$ 776 $ 583 $ 477 (1)  The fiscal year 2021 balance represents prior year gross unrecognized tax benefits recorded as a result of the Mellanox acquisition. We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term liability, or reduction of long-term deferred tax assets or amount refundable if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a period beyond a year.Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of January 31, 2021, January 26, 2020, and January 27, 2019, we had accrued $44 million, $31 million, and $21 million, respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 31, 2021, unrecognized tax benefits of $352 million and the related interest and penalties of $43 million are included in non-current income taxes payable, and unrecognized tax benefits of $5 million and the related interest and penalties of $1 million are included in current income taxes payable.While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. As of January 31, 2021, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)74We are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 31, 2021, the significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include the United States, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, United Kingdom, Germany, Israel, and India for fiscal years 2005 through 2020. As of January 31, 2021, the significant tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examination include the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Israel and India, for fiscal years 2005 through 2019.Note 15 - Shareholders’ EquityCapital Return ProgramBeginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.Through January 31, 2021, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $7.08 billion. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As of January 31, 2021, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. During fiscal year 2021, we paid $395 million in cash dividends to our shareholders.Note 16 - Employee Retirement PlansWe provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans to eligible employees in the U.S. and certain other countries. Our contribution expense for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $120 million, $76 million, and $70 million, respectively.Note 17 - Segment Information Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial performance. In the prior fiscal year, we had reported two operating segments: GPU and Tegra Processor. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we changed our operating segments to be consistent with the revised manner in which our CODM reviews our financial performance and allocates resources. The two new operating segments are "Graphics" and "Compute & Networking". Comparative periods presented reflect this change. Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments. Our Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems. Our Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms.Operating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments.The “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Graphics or Compute & Networking for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related costs, legal settlement costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature. Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the “All Other” category.NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)75 GraphicsCompute & NetworkingAll OtherConsolidated(In millions)Year Ended January 31, 2021:    Revenue$ 9,834 $ 6,841 $ — $ 16,675 Operating income (loss)$ 4,612 $ 2,548 $ (2,628) $ 4,532 Year Ended January 26, 2020:    Revenue$ 7,639 $ 3,279 $ — $ 10,918 Operating income (loss)$ 3,267 $ 751 $ (1,172) $ 2,846 Year Ended January 27, 2019:    Revenue$ 8,159 $ 3,557 $ — $ 11,716 Operating income (loss)$ 3,417 $ 1,251 $ (864) $ 3,804 Year EndedJanuary 31,2021January 26,2020January 27,2019(In millions)Reconciling items included in "All Other" category:Stock-based compensation expense$ (1,397) $ (844) $ (557) Acquisition-related intangible asset amortization (591)  (6)  (6) Unallocated cost of revenue and operating expenses (357)  (283)  (261) Acquisition-related inventory step-up charge (161)  —  — Acquisition-related and other costs (84)  (25)  4 IP-related costs (38)  (14)  (35) Legal settlement costs —  —  (9) Total$ (2,628) $ (1,172) $ (864) Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if our customers’ revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location.
