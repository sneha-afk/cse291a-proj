Corporate Governance Highlights
Our Board is committed to strong corporate governance to promote the long-term interests of NVIDIA and our
stockholders. We seek a collaborative approach to stockholder issues that affect our business and to ensure that our
stockholders see our governance and executive pay practices as well-structured. In the Fall of 2020, we contacted our
top institutional holders who held 1% or more of our stock (with the exception of brokerage firms and index funds who
we know do not engage in direct conversations), representing an aggregate ownership of 33%, to gain insights into their
views on corporate governance; ESG issues; and our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Members of our management
and Board, including our Lead Director, met with stockholders holding, in total, 32% of our common stock outstanding.
Highlights of our corporate governance practices include:
ü All Board members independent, except for our CEO ü 75% or greater attendance by each Board member at
ü Independent Lead Director meetings of the Board and applicable committees
ü Proxy access ü Independent directors frequently meet in executive

Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation for Fiscal 2021 (Proposal 2)
We are asking our stockholders to cast a non-binding vote, also known as “say-on-pay,” to approve our NEOs’
compensation. The Board believes that our compensation policies and practices are effective in achieving our goals of
paying for performance; providing competitive pay so that we may attract and retain a high-caliber executive team;
aligning our executives’ interests with those of our stockholders to create long-term value; and achieving simplicity and
transparency with our compensation program. The Board and our stockholders have approved holding our “say-on-pay”
votes annually.
Executive Compensation Highlights
Our executive compensation program is designed to pay for performance. We utilize compensation elements that align
our NEOs’ interests with those of our stockholders to create long-term value. Our NEO pay is heavily weighted toward
performance-based, “at-risk” variable cash and long-term equity awards that are only earned if the Company achieves
pre-established corporate financial metrics, but capped at a maximum of 200% of target (or 150% of target for our CEO’s
PSUs). For the last several years, over 90% of our CEO’s, and over 50% of our other NEOs’, target pay has been
performance-based and at-risk, and 100% of our CEO’s equity awards have been in the form of PSUs only.
At our 2020 Meeting, over 95% of the votes cast approved the compensation paid to our NEOs for Fiscal 2020. After
considering this advisory vote and the feedback from our annual stockholder outreach, our CC concluded that our
program effectively aligned executive pay with stockholder interests. Therefore, the CC maintained the same general
executive compensation structure for Fiscal 2021, but increased the rigor of the performance goals for revenue and
Non-GAAP Operating Income by setting the Threshold goals above Fiscal 2020 actual achievement, and increased the
proportion of target pay that is “at-risk” to strengthen the link between corporate performance and executive pay.
Financial Performance and Link to Executive Pay
Despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, in Fiscal 2021, we achieved record revenue for our Gaming and Data
Center market platforms and for the overall Company, enhanced our networking technologies by completing the
acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd., launched the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture for our Gaming and Data
Center platforms, and announced a partnership with Mercedes-Benz to introduce software-defined, intelligent vehicles
using end-to-end NVIDIA technology.
As described further in our CD&A, a significant portion of our executive pay opportunities are tied to the achievement of
financial measures that drive business value and contribute to our long-term success. While COVID-19 affected our
business in both positive and negative ways, the CC determined not to make any changes to our Fiscal 2021 executive
compensation performance goals or in certification of actual Fiscal 2021 results as a result of COVID-19. In accordance
with the performance goals and methodology established by the CC in early Fiscal 2021, the CC excluded the additional
revenue and the estimated unaudited operating income and costs generated by acquisitions completed during Fiscal
2021 in its certification of Fiscal 2021 results. The CC determined the foregoing approach best aligned our executives’
interests with those of our stockholders and remained consistent with our pay for performance philosophy. The table
below shows our goals for the applicable period ended Fiscal 2021 and their respective impact on our executive pay.

Ratification of Selection of PwC as our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for Fiscal 2022 (Proposal 3)
Although not required, we are asking our stockholders to ratify the AC’s selection of PwC as our independent registered
public accounting firm for Fiscal 2022 because we believe it is a matter of good corporate practice. If our stockholders
do not ratify the selection, the AC will reconsider the appointment, but may nevertheless retain PwC. Even if the selection
is ratified, the AC may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time if it determines that
such a change would be in the best interests of NVIDIA and our stockholders.
Approval of an Amendment to our Charter to Increase the Number of Authorized Shares of Common Stock from 2
Billion Shares to 4 Billion Shares (Proposal 4)
We are asking our stockholders to approve an amendment to our Charter to increase the number of authorized shares
of common stock from two billion shares to four billion shares. The Charter amendment will provide adequate shares of
common stock to be used by the Board for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, expanding our
business through mergers and acquisitions, including shares we would be obligated to issue in connection with the
pending acquisition of Arm Limited; stock dividends and/or stock splits; providing equity incentives to employees,
officers or directors; and the raising of additional capital.
Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance Initiatives
NVIDIA invents the computing technologies that enable scientists, engineers, designers, researchers, and developers to
improve lives everywhere and address global challenges. We integrate sound ESG principles and practices into every
aspect of the Company, including the following initiatives:
• Human capital management: To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must
recruit, develop, and retain talented employees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical
staff, and research and development personnel.
• Diversity and inclusion: We believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to a more
inclusive culture that supports all employees, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, veteran
status, race, ethnicity, or disability. We have increased our efforts to recruit, develop, and retain a more diverse
workforce with a focus on those historically underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black,
and Hispanic candidates.
• Climate change and the environment: We integrate energy efficiency principles into our products and drive
operational excellence to reduce our environmental impact. We have a goal to source 65 percent of our global
electricity use from renewable energy by the end of Fiscal 2025.
• Public policy engagement and accountability: We engage in public policy advocacy to affect government action
on issues of importance to our business, customers, stockholders, and employees, and to provide thought
leadership to global governments on issues that directly affect our business. We also belong to a number of
trade associations worldwide, representing the interests of the technology industry, industries in which we
operate and the broader business community. We make no contributions of any kind to political parties or
candidates, including any direct contributions to any intermediary organizations, such as political action
committees (PACs) or lobbyists, campaign funds, or trade or industry associations and super PACs.

PROXY STATEMENT FOR THE 2021 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS - JUNE 3, 2021
____________________________________________________
INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING
Your proxy is being solicited for use at the 2021 Meeting on behalf of the Board. Our 2021 Meeting will take place
virtually on Thursday, June 3, 2021 at 11:00 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time.
Virtual Meeting Philosophy and Benefits
The Board believes that holding the meeting in a virtual format invites stockholder participation, while reducing the costs
to stockholders and the Company associated with an in-person meeting. This balance allows the meeting to remain
focused on matters directly relevant to the interests of stockholders in an efficient way. We have designed the virtual
format to protect stockholder rights, including by offering multiple opportunities to ask questions, publishing answers to
questions received before or during the meeting on our Investor Relations website, and providing an archived copy of the
webcast after the meeting.
Meeting Attendance
If you were an NVIDIA stockholder as of the close of business on the April 5, 2021 record date, or if you hold a valid
proxy, you can attend, ask questions during, and vote at our 2021 Meeting at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/
NVIDIA2021. Our meeting will be held virtually; use the Control Number included on your Notice or printed proxy card to
enter. Anyone can also listen to the meeting live at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/NVIDIA2021.
If you encounter any difficulties accessing the virtual meeting during the check-in or the course of the annual meeting,
please call the technical support number available on www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/NVIDIA2021.
An archived copy of the webcast will be available at www.nvidia.com/proxy through June 17, 2021. Even if you plan to
attend the 2021 Meeting virtually, we recommend that you also vote by proxy as described below so that your vote will
be counted if you later decide not to attend.
Asking Questions
We encourage stockholders to submit questions through our pre-meeting forum located at www.proxyvote.com (using
the Control Number included on your Notice or printed proxy card) as well as during the meeting at
www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/NVIDIA2021. During the meeting, we will answer as many stockholder-submitted
questions related to the business of the meeting as time permits. As soon as practicable following the meeting, we will
publish and answer questions received, if pertinent to Company business, on our Investor Relations website. We intend
to group questions and answers by topic and substantially similar questions will be answered only once. To promote
fairness to all stockholders and efficient use of the Company’s resources, we will respond to one question per
stockholder.

--- Page 29 ---

Quorum and Voting
To hold our 2021 Meeting, we need a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at the close of business on the
April 5, 2021 record date, or a quorum, represented at the 2021 Meeting either by attendance virtually or by proxy. On
April 5, 2021, there were 622,383,615 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote, meaning that
311,191,808 shares must be represented at the 2021 Meeting or by proxy to have a quorum. A list of stockholders
entitled to vote at the close of business on the April 5, 2021 record date will be available during the entire time of the
annual meeting at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/NVIDIA2021 and electronically for 10 days prior to the annual
meeting to registered stockholders for any legally valid purpose related to the annual meeting. For access to the
stockholder list, please contact us at shareholdermeeting@nvidia.com.
Your shares will be counted towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy or vote at the 2021 Meeting.
Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted towards the quorum requirement. If there is not a quorum, a majority
of the votes present may adjourn the meeting to another date.
You may vote FOR any nominee to the Board, you may WITHHOLD your vote for any nominee or you may ABSTAIN from
voting. For each other matter to be voted on, you may vote FOR or AGAINST or ABSTAIN from voting.
Stockholder of Record
You are a stockholder of record if your shares were registered directly in your name with our transfer agent,
Computershare, on April 5, 2021, and you can vote shares, change your vote or revoke your proxy before the final vote at
the 2021 Meeting in any of the following ways:
Change Your Revoke Your

Attend the 2021 Meeting virtually and vote during the meeting ü ü
Via mail, by signing and mailing your proxy card to us before the
2021 Meeting ü
By telephone or via the Internet, by following the instructions

Send a written notice that you are revoking your proxy to NVIDIA
Corporation, 2788 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, California
95051, Attention: Timothy S. Teter, Secretary or via email to ü
shareholdermeeting@nvidia.com
If you do not vote using any of the ways described above, your shares will not be voted.
Street Name Holder
If your shares are held through a nominee, such as a bank or broker, as of April 5, 2021, then you are the beneficial
owner of shares held in “street name,” and you have the right to direct the nominee how to vote those shares for the
2021 Meeting. The nominee should provide you a separate Notice or voting instructions, and you should follow those
instructions to tell the nominee how to vote. To vote by attending the 2021 Meeting virtually, you must obtain a valid
proxy from your nominee.
If you are a beneficial holder and do not provide voting instructions to your nominee, the nominee will not be authorized
to vote your shares on “non-routine” matters, including elections of directors (even if not contested), executive
compensation (including any advisory stockholder votes on executive compensation) and amendments of charter
documents. This is called a “broker non-vote.” However, the nominee can still register your shares as being present at
the 2021 Meeting for determining quorum, and the nominee will have discretion to vote for matters considered by the
NYSE to be “routine,” including the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm. Therefore, you
MUST give your nominee instructions in order for your vote to be counted on the proposals to elect directors, to
conduct an advisory approval of our executive compensation, and to amend our Charter. We strongly encourage you
to vote.
Note that under the rules of the national stock exchanges, any NVIDIA stockholder whose shares are held in street name
by a member brokerage firm may revoke a proxy and vote his or her shares at the 2021 Meeting only in accordance with
applicable rules and procedures of those exchanges, as employed by the street name holder’s brokerage firm.

If you are a stockholder of record and you return a signed proxy card without marking any selections, your shares will be
voted FOR each of the nominees listed in Proposal 1 and FOR the other proposals. If any other matter is properly
presented at the 2021 Meeting, Jen-Hsun Huang or Timothy S. Teter as your proxyholder will vote your shares using his
best judgment.
Vote Results
Preliminary voting results will be announced at the 2021 Meeting. Final voting results will be published in a current
report on Form 8-K, which will be filed with the SEC by June 9, 2021.
Proxy Materials
As permitted by SEC rules, we are making our proxy materials available to stockholders online at www.nvidia.com/
proxy. On or about April 22, 2021, we sent stockholders who own our common stock at the close of business on April 5,
2021 (other than those who previously requested electronic or paper delivery) a Notice containing instructions on how to
access our proxy materials, vote via the Internet or by telephone, and elect to receive future proxy materials
electronically or in printed form by mail.
If you choose to receive future proxy materials electronically (via www.proxyvote.com for stockholders of record and
www.icsdelivery.com/nvda for street name holders), you will receive an email next year with links to the proxy materials
and proxy voting site.
SEC rules also permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy Notice and proxy material delivery
requirements for multiple stockholders with the same address by delivering a single Notice or set of proxy materials
addressed to those stockholders. We follow this practice, known as “householding,” unless we have received contrary
instructions from any stockholder at that address.
If you received more than one Notice or full set of proxy materials, then your shares are either registered in more than
one name or are held in different accounts. Please vote the shares covered by each Notice or proxy card. To modify your
instructions so that you receive one Notice or proxy card for each account or name, please contact your broker. Your
“householding” election will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent.
To make a change regarding the form in which you receive proxy materials (electronically or in print), or to request
receipt of a separate set of documents to a household, contact our Investor Relations Department (through our website
at www.nvidia.com, with an email to shareholdermeeting@nvidia.com, by phone at (408) 486-2000 or by mail at 2788
San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, California 95051).
We will pay the entire cost of soliciting proxies. Our directors and employees may also solicit proxies in person, by
telephone, by mail, via the Internet or by other means of communication. Our directors and employees will not be paid
any additional compensation for soliciting proxies. We have also retained MacKenzie Partners on an advisory basis for
an approximate fee of $15,000 and they may help us solicit proxies from brokers, bank nominees and other institutional
9

--- Page 31 ---

owners. We may also reimburse brokerage firms, banks and other agents for the cost of forwarding proxy materials to
beneficial owners.
2022 Meeting Stockholder Proposals
To be considered for inclusion in next year’s proxy materials, your proposal must be submitted in writing by December
24, 2021 to NVIDIA Corporation, 2788 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, California 95051, Attention: Timothy S. Teter,
Secretary or by email to shareholdermeeting@nvidia.com, and must comply with all applicable requirements of
Rule 14a-8 promulgated under the Exchange Act. However, if we do not hold our 2022 Meeting between May 4, 2022
and July 3, 2022, then the deadline is a reasonable time before we begin to print and send our proxy materials. If you
wish to submit a proposal for consideration at the 2022 Meeting that is not to be included in next year’s proxy materials,
you must do so in writing following the above instructions not later than the close of business on March 5, 2022, and not
earlier than February 3, 2022. We also advise you to review our Bylaws, which contain additional requirements about
advance notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations.

Director Qualifications and Nomination of Directors
The NCGC identifies, reviews and assesses the qualifications of existing and potential directors and selects nominees for
recommendation to the Board for approval. The committee is committed to Board diversity and shall consider a
nominee’s background and experience to ensure that a broad range of perspectives is represented on the Board. The
NCGC may conduct any appropriate and necessary inquiries into the backgrounds and qualifications of possible

evaluating, and conducting due diligence on potential director nominees. The NCGC has not established specific age,
gender, education, experience, or skill requirements for potential members, and instead considers numerous factors
regarding the nominee taking into account our current and future business models, including the following:
• Integrity and candor • Diversity, including race, ethnicity, sexuality, gender or
• Independence membership in another underrepresented community
• Senior leadership and operational experience • Human capital management experience

other companies) • Ability to represent the interests of the stockholders as a
whole rather than special interest groups or constituencies
• Marketing, communications and brand management

The NCGC and the Board understand the importance of Board refreshment, and strive to maintain an appropriate
balance of tenure, diversity, professional experience and backgrounds, skills, and education on the Board. While the
Board benefits from the experience and institutional knowledge that our longer-serving directors bring, it has also
brought in new perspectives and ideas by appointing two new directors in the past year: John O. Dabiri, a professor of
aeronautics and mechanical engineering at the California Institute of Technology, and Aarti Shah, an IT, digital health,
cybersecurity, and advanced analytics & data sciences executive at Eli Lilly and Company. Our longer-tenured directors
are familiar with our operations and business areas and have the perspective of overseeing our activities from a variety
of economic and competitive environments. Our new directors have brought expertise in brand development and
cybersecurity and familiarity with technology developments at leading academic institutions that are important to
supporting NVIDIA as it enters new markets. Each year, the NCGC and Board review each director’s individual
performance, including the director’s past contributions, outside experiences and activities, and committee participation,
and determine how his or her experience and skills continue to add value to NVIDIA and the Board.

Information About the Board of Directors and Corporate Governance
Independence of the Members of the Board of Directors
Nasdaq rules and our Corporate Governance Policies (as further described below) require that a majority of our
directors not have a relationship that would interfere with their exercise of independent judgment in carrying out their
responsibilities and that they meet any other qualification requirements required by the SEC and Nasdaq. After
considering all relevant relationships and transactions, our Board determined that, except for Mr. Huang, all of our
directors are “independent” as defined by Nasdaq’s rules and regulations. In addition, the Board previously determined
that James C. Gaither, a former director who retired from our Board effective June 9, 2020, was independent under
applicable Nasdaq listing standards.
The Board also determined that all members of our AC, CC and NCGC are independent under applicable Nasdaq listing
standards, and that each of Messrs. McCaffery, Perry and Seawell and Ms. Hudson of the AC are “audit committee
financial experts” as defined under applicable SEC rules.
Board Leadership Structure
Our Board believes that each of its members should have an equal voice in the affairs and the management of NVIDIA,
and therefore, our stockholders are best served at this time by having an independent Lead Director, rather than having
a chairperson. Our Lead Director is an integral part of our Board structure and a critical aspect of our effective
corporate governance. The independent directors consider the role and designation of the Lead Director on an annual
basis, and Mr. Perry was appointed as our Lead Director in 2018. In addition, Mr. Perry serves on both the NCGC and the
AC, which affords him increased engagement with Board governance and composition as well as with risk assessment
and management, and financial and regulatory matters of the Company. While the CEO has primary responsibility for
preparing the agendas for Board meetings and presiding over the portion of the meetings of the Board where he is
present, our Lead Director has significant responsibilities, which are set forth in our Corporate Governance Policies, and
include, in part:
• Determining an appropriate schedule of Board meetings, and seeking to ensure that the independent members
of the Board can perform their duties responsibly while not interfering with the flow of our operations;
• Working with the CEO, and seeking input from other directors and relevant management, as to the preparation
of the agendas for Board meetings;
• Advising the CEO on a regular basis as to the quality, quantity and timeliness of the flow of information
requested by the Board from our management with the goal of providing what is necessary for the independent
members of the Board to effectively and responsibly perform their duties, and, although our management is
responsible for the preparation of materials for the Board, the Lead Director may specifically request the
inclusion of certain material; and
• Coordinating, developing the agenda for, and moderating executive sessions of the independent members of the
Board, and acting as principal liaison between them and the CEO on sensitive issues.
The active involvement of our independent directors, combined with the qualifications and significant responsibilities of
our Lead Director, provide balance on the Board and promote strong, independent oversight of our management and
affairs.
Role of the Board in Risk Oversight
The Board is responsible for overseeing risk management at NVIDIA and delegates oversight of appropriate topics to its
committees. Our AC has the responsibility to consider and discuss major financial risk exposures and the steps
management has taken to monitor and control these exposures. The AC also monitors compliance with certain legal and
regulatory requirements and oversees the performance of the internal audit function. Our NCGC monitors the
effectiveness of our anonymous tip process and corporate governance guidelines, including whether they are successful
in preventing illegal or improper liability-creating conduct, and oversees environmental, social and corporate
governance risks, ranging from the impact of artificial intelligence to diversity and inclusion to climate change. Our CC
assesses and monitors whether any of our compensation policies and programs has the potential to encourage
excessive risk-taking. The Board exercises direct oversight of strategic risks to NVIDIA and other risk areas not
delegated to one of its committees, including business continuity and cybersecurity.
Management periodically provides information, including guidance on risk management and mitigation, to the Board or a
relevant committee. Each committee also reports to the Board on those matters.

The Board and its committees have received regular reports from management regarding the impact, risks and
opportunities of COVID-19 on our business, operations and people. For example, while our Professional Visualization
and Automotive market platforms were negatively affected by the pandemic, our Gaming and Data Center market
platforms have benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn, and play from home. COVID-19 has
also caused volatility and disruption in global financial markets and global economic activity, and has impacted the
supply chain, including logistical services and component supply, topics on which the Board and its committees were
briefed regularly. Additionally, the Board has overseen the execution of management’s initiatives to protect the health
and safety of our workforce, including closure of our offices, compliance with shelter-in-place orders and the temporary
prohibition on most business travel, and to support NVIDIANs and their families during a challenging year by moving up
our annual focal review to accelerate the timing of raises and implementing a one-week company-wide shut down in
December for our people to recharge.
Corporate Governance Policies of the Board of Directors
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Policies to ensure that it has the necessary authority and processes in
place to review and evaluate our business operations as needed and to make decisions that are independent of our
management. The Corporate Governance Policies set forth the practices the Board follows with respect to its
composition and selection, regular evaluations of the Board and its committees, Board meetings and involvement of
senior management, chief executive officer performance evaluation, and Board committees and compensation. Our
Corporate Governance Policies may be viewed under Governance in the Investor Relations section of our website at
www.nvidia.com.
Executive Sessions of the Board
As required under Nasdaq’s listing standards, our independent directors have in the past met, and will continue to meet,
regularly in scheduled executive sessions at which only independent directors are present, as well as in sessions with
the CEO. In Fiscal 2021, our independent directors met in both types of executive sessions at all four of our scheduled
quarterly Board meetings.
Director Attendance at Annual Meeting
We do not have a formal policy regarding attendance by members of the Board at our annual meetings. We expect that
our directors will attend each annual meeting, absent a valid reason. All Board members as of the 2020 Meeting
attended our 2020 Meeting.
Board Self-Assessments
In Fiscal 2021, the NCGC oversaw an evaluation process, conducted at least annually, whereby outside corporate counsel
for NVIDIA interviewed each director to obtain his or her evaluation of the Board as a whole, and of the committees on
which he or she serves. The interviews solicited ideas from the directors about, among other things, improving the
quality of Board and/or committee oversight effectiveness regarding strategic direction, financial and audit matters,
executive compensation, acquisition activity and other key matters. The interviews also focused on Board process and
identifying specific issues which should be discussed in the future. After these evaluations were complete, our outside
corporate counsel summarized the results, reviewed them with our Lead Director, and then submitted the summary for
discussion by the NCGC.
In response to the evaluations conducted in Fiscal 2021, our Board determined to focus recruiting efforts on director
candidates with diversity of gender and/or racial/ethnic background, to further strengthen our director onboarding
programs, and to dedicate additional time to certain Board agenda items such as cybersecurity, diversity and inclusion,
and other ESG matters.
Director Orientation and Continuing Education
The NCGC and our General Counsel are responsible for new director orientation and for administering or approving
eligible director continuing education programs. Continuing education programs for directors may include a combination
of internally developed materials and presentations, programs presented by third parties, and financial and
administrative support for attendance at qualifying academic or other independent programs.
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines
The Board believes that directors should hold a significant equity interest in NVIDIA. Our Corporate Governance Policies
require each non-employee director to hold shares of our common stock with a total value equal to six times the annual
cash retainer for Board service during the period in which he or she serves as a director (or six times his base salary, in
28

--- Page 50 ---

the case of the CEO). The shares may include vested deferred stock, shares held in trust and shares held by immediate
family members. Non-employee directors have five years after their Board appointment to reach the ownership
threshold. Our stock ownership guidelines are intended to further align director interests with stockholder interests.
Each non-employee director and Mr. Huang currently meets or exceeds the stock ownership requirements, with the
exception of Drs. Dabiri and Shah, who joined our Board in 2020 and have five years from joining the Board to reach the
ownership threshold.
Hedging and Pledging Policy
Under our Insider Trading Policy, our directors, executive officers, employees, and their designees may not hedge their
ownership of NVIDIA stock, including but not limited to trading in options, puts, calls, or other derivative instruments
related to NVIDIA stock or debt to protect against a decline in the value of the Company’s stock. Additionally, directors,
executive officers, employees, and their designees may not purchase NVIDIA stock on margin, borrow against NVIDIA
stock held in a margin account, or pledge NVIDIA stock as collateral for a loan. We allow for certain portfolio
diversification transactions, such as investments in exchange funds.
Outside Advisors
The Board and each of its principal committees may retain outside advisors and consultants of their choosing at our
expense. The Board need not obtain management’s consent to retain outside advisors. In addition, the principal
committees need not obtain either the Board’s or management’s consent to retain outside advisors.
Code of Conduct
We expect our directors, executives and employees to conduct themselves with the highest degree of integrity, ethics
and honesty. Our credibility and reputation depend upon the good judgment, ethical standards and personal integrity of
each director, executive and employee. We have a Code of Conduct that applies to our executive officers, directors and
employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. We also
have a Financial Team Code of Conduct that applies to our executive officers, directors and members of our finance
department. We regularly review our Code of Conduct and related policies to ensure that they provide clear guidance to
our directors, executives and employees.
The Code of Conduct and the Financial Team Code of Conduct are available under Governance in the Investor Relations
section of our website at www.nvidia.com. If we make any amendments to the Code of Conduct or the Financial Team
Code of Conduct or grant any waiver from a provision of either code to any executive officer or director, we will promptly
disclose the nature of the amendment or waiver on our website.
Corporate Hotline
We have established an independent corporate hotline to allow any employee to confidentially and anonymously lodge a
complaint about any accounting, internal control, auditing, Code of Conduct or other matter of concern (unless prohibited
by local privacy laws for employees located in the European Union).
Stockholder Communications with the Board of Directors
Stockholders who wish to communicate with the Board regarding nominations of directors or other matters may do so
by sending electronic written communications addressed to Timothy S. Teter, our Secretary, at
shareholdermeeting@nvidia.com. All stockholder communications we receive that are addressed to the Board will be
compiled by our Secretary. If no particular director is named, letters will be forwarded, depending on the subject matter,
to the chairperson of the AC, CC or NCGC. Matters put forth by our stockholders will be reviewed by the NCGC, which will
determine whether these matters should be presented to the Board. The NCGC will give serious consideration to all such
matters and will make its determination in accordance with its charter and applicable laws.
Majority Vote Standard
Under our Bylaws, if the votes cast FOR an incumbent director in a non-contested election do not exceed the number of
WITHHOLD votes, such incumbent director shall promptly tender a resignation to the Board. The NCGC will then review
the circumstances surrounding the WITHHOLD vote and promptly make a recommendation to the Board on whether to
accept or reject the resignation or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the NCGC’s
recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date of
certification of the stockholder vote.
29

--- Page 51 ---

In a contested election, in which the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, our directors
will be elected by a plurality of the shares represented at any such meeting or by proxy and entitled to vote on the
election of directors at that meeting. The directors receiving the greatest number of FOR votes will be elected.
Board Meeting Information
The Board met 10 times during Fiscal 2021, including meetings during which the Board discussed the strategic direction
of NVIDIA, explored and discussed new business and strategic opportunities and the product roadmap, and other
matters facing NVIDIA. We expect each Board member to attend each meeting of the Board and the committees on
which he or she serves. Each Board member attended 75% or more of the meetings of the Board and of each committee
on which he or she served.
Committees of the Board of Directors
The Board has three standing committees: an AC, a CC and a NCGC. Each of these committees operates under a written
charter, which may be viewed under Governance in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.nvidia.com.
The composition and functions of our committees are set forth below. Committee assignments are determined based on
background and the expertise which individual directors can bring to a committee. Our Board believes that rotations
among committees are a good corporate governance practice which allows its members to be more fully informed
regarding the full scope of the Board and our activities, and benefits each committee and the Board as a whole, as a
result of diverse perspectives and ideas that are introduced through new committee formations.

Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance
NVIDIA invents the computing technologies that enable scientists, engineers, designers, researchers, and developers to
improve lives everywhere and address global challenges. We integrate sound ESG principles and practices into every
aspect of the Company. The following section provides an overview of these principles and practices. More information
can be found on the Corporate Social Responsibility section of our website and in our 2020 Corporate Social
Responsibility Report, which was prepared in accordance with the Core Option of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)
Standards: Core Option and is responsive to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards for the
Technology and Communications sector, Semiconductor industry. Information contained on our website is not
incorporated by reference into this Proxy Statement or any other report we file with the SEC.
Human Capital Management
We believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our
stakeholders. As of the end of Fiscal 2021, we had 18,975 employees in 29 countries. 13,532 were engaged in research
and development and 5,443 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions.
To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented
employees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and research and development
personnel. The primary ways in which we seek to do this are summarized below.
Recruitment
The demand for talent in new markets, such as AI and deep learning, is increasingly competitive. Our intern and new
college graduate recruiting programs are a sustainable source of talent. We partner with higher education institutions
globally to develop our candidate pipelines, recruit at industry conferences, and encourage our employees to submit
referrals, with over 36% of hires coming from internal recommendations. Collaborations with our community resource
groups improve how we reach and attract minority candidates.
Development and Retention
To support employee advancement, we provide training on-the-job through coaching, feedback, and role modeling. We
have a rich library of live and on-demand learning experiences such as workshops, panel discussions, speaker-based
forums, and internally focused technical conferences. We curate learning libraries around our most common
development needs, provide the latest technical platforms to support self-paced learning, and regularly listen to learner
feedback through internal messaging channels to improve and update those topics. We offer tuition reimbursement
programs and subsidize advanced technical education programs and online technical certifications. We encourage
internal mobility through career expos and coaching, as well as foster mentorship connections and provide trained
coaches as additional developmental support. Our strong partnerships with internal community resource groups allow
us to personalize programs to address specific career development needs.
To evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use several listening mechanisms such as pulse surveys, a
suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party hotline.
In fiscal year 2021, our overall turnover rate was 3.8%.
Compensation, Benefits, and Well-Being
Our compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company’s
future. Employees receive equity (except where unavailable due to local regulations) with a realized value that is tied to
our stock price performance and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with
those of our stockholders.
We offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ well-being, including 401(k) programs in
the U.S., statutory pension programs outside the U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours and
time off, and programs to address mental health, stress, and time-management challenges. We evaluate our benefit
offerings globally and are committed to providing tailored benefits based on community needs, including assistance for
military members, additional mental health benefits, and support for new parents, and those who wish to become
parents.
Safety and COVID-19
We support our people and their families in making their health a top priority. We implemented global protocols to slow
the spread of COVID-19 and to keep our workforce safe by closing our offices around the world in March 2020 for all
except essential workers. We also eliminated most business travel. We provided our employees with resources to work
32

--- Page 54 ---

remotely and continued to pay all employees and contractors. For essential labs and offices that remain open, we
instituted appropriate safety protocols and social distancing guidelines. Additionally, we provided resources for
employees, including work from home support, enhanced health coverage, reimbursement for certain work from home
expenses, and learning and development resources on how to lead and manage remotely.
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to a more inclusive culture that supports all
employees, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, veteran status, race, ethnicity, or disability.
We have increased our efforts to recruit, develop, and retain a more diverse workforce with a focus on those historically
underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black, and Hispanic candidates. In Fiscal 2021, we created
the role of Head of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, along with hiring a global diversity recruiting leader, and a Head
of Strategic Initiatives to build our developer ecosystem and ensure it represents the global population.
Efforts we are undertaking include:
• Shepherding underrepresented candidates through the interviewing process, engaging employees from
underrepresented communities for recruiting events and interview panels, and increased investment in
minority-serving institutions and professional organizations;
• Developing an internal slate of diverse talent for open management positions, beginning semi-annual talent
review sessions with executives to identify internal, diverse talent, and forming sponsorship and career
acceleration programs; and
• Increasing inclusion communications and pulse surveys to measure employee sentiments
As of the end of Fiscal 2021, our global workforce was 80% men and 20% women, and 6% of our workforce in the United
States was composed of Black or African American, and Hispanic or Latino employees.
Climate Change and the Environment
We drive operational excellence to reduce our environmental impact. Our rapid and significant business growth and the
urgent climate action imperative mean that we must focus on expanding strategically, managing our operations
efficiently, and sourcing low-carbon and renewable forms of energy to avoid growth in our greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions footprint.
After meeting our goal of a 15 percent reduction in scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, normalized per employee, from Fiscal
2014 to Fiscal 2020, we developed a new goal to source 65 percent of our global electricity use from renewable energy
by the end of Fiscal 2025.
We also integrate energy efficiency principles into our products. Whether it is creation of technology to power next-
generation notebooks or designs to support high-performance supercomputers, improving energy efficiency is a
principal goal in each step of our research, development, and design processes. As a result, graphics processing units
(GPUs) are inherently more energy efficient than other ways of computation because they are optimized for throughput
and performance per watt rather than absolute performance.
Public Policy Engagement and Accountability
Our Government Relations team engages in public policy advocacy to affect government action on issues of importance
to our business, customers, stockholders, and employees, and to provide thought leadership to global governments on
issues that directly affect our business. It is also a platform for educating policymakers through demonstrations of
NVIDIA’s technology, amplifying our work in targeted areas, and collaborating with various organizations on issues of
shared interest. We focus our public policy activities in artificial intelligence (AI), specifically to promote investment in
core AI research, support workforce development around AI, and provide educational resources to technology policy
advisors. NVIDIA may make expenditures to support or advocate particular viewpoints on public policy issues, including
expenditures for intermediaries that advocate on our behalf if it is in our best interest.
NVIDIA does not make contributions of any kind (money, employee time, goods or services or employee expense
reimbursements), to political parties or candidates, including any direct contributions to any intermediary organizations,
such as political action committees (PAC) or lobbyists, campaign funds, or trade or industry associations and super
PACs. This policy applies in all countries and across all levels of government, even where such contributions are
permitted by law.
33

--- Page 55 ---

We belong to a number of trade associations worldwide, representing the interests of the technology industry, industries
in which we operate and the broader business community. These organizations work to bring about industry consensus
and advocacy on major public policy issues. Where required by law, we file lobbying disclosure reports with U.S. federal,
state and local governments.
Our NCGC oversees our public policy engagement and accountability. Management reports to the NCGC about our
policies and practices in connection with governmental relations, public policy advocacy, and related expenditures.
NVIDIA’s policies and practices related to public policy matters, including lobbying activities, trade association
memberships, and related expenditures, are available on our website at https://investor.nvidia.com/governance/
governance-documents/default.aspx.

Director Compensation
The CC reviews our non-employee director compensation program each year with the assistance of Exequity LLP, the
CC’s independent compensation consultant, who prepares a comprehensive assessment of our program, including
comparison to our Fiscal 2020 peer group used for executive compensation purposes, an update on recent trends in
director compensation, and a review of related corporate governance best practices. Following this review, the CC
recommended no changes to our non-employee director compensation program for the year starting on the date of our
2020 Meeting, which we refer to as the 2020 Program.
The CC subsequently recommended, and the Board approved, a mix of cash and equity awards for each non-employee
director with an approximate annual value of $300,000, which was slightly below the median total annual compensation
paid by similarly sized technology peer companies to their non-employee directors. We do not pay additional fees for
serving as a Lead Director, chairperson or member of Board committees or for meeting attendance. Directors who are
also employees do not receive fees or equity compensation for service on the Board.
Cash Compensation
The cash portion of the annual retainer, representing $75,000 on an annualized basis, was paid quarterly. Each of Drs.
Dabiri and Shah were paid the pro-rata portion of the annual cash retainer for service on the Board from the date of
appointment to the date of our 2021 Meeting.
Equity Compensation
The value of the annual equity award, in the form of RSUs, or the 2020 Program RSUs, was $225,000. The number of
shares subject to each RSU award equaled this value, divided by the average closing market price of our common stock
over the 60 calendar days ending the business day before the 2020 Meeting. The RSUs were granted on the first trading
day following the date of our 2020 Meeting.
To correlate the vesting of the RSUs to the non-employee directors’ service on the Board and its committees over the
following year, 50% of the 2020 Program RSUs vested on November 18, 2020 (the third Wednesday in November 2020)
and the remaining 50% will vest on May 19, 2021 (the third Wednesday in May 2021). If a non-employee director’s
service terminates due to death, his or her RSU grants will immediately vest in full for the benefit of his or her
beneficiary. Non-employee directors do not receive dividend equivalents on unvested RSUs.
In connection with Dr. Dabiri’s appointment to the Board in July 2020, he was granted on August 10, 2020: (a) an initial
RSU grant with a value of $225,000, which vests as to 1/6th of the shares approximately every six months, or the Initial
Dabiri RSUs, and (b) an annual RSU grant equal to the grant value of the 2020 Program RSUs, pro-rated for the period of
time from Dr. Dabiri’s appointment in July 2020 to the date of our 2021 Meeting, which vest on the same schedule as the
2020 Program RSUs, with the pro-rated amount vesting on November 18, 2020 and the remainder vesting on May 19,
2021, or the 2020 Program Dabiri RSUs. The number of shares subject to the Initial Dabiri RSUs equaled the value of the
grant, divided by the average closing market price of our common stock over the 60 calendar days ending the business
day before Dr. Dabiri’s appointment to the Board. The number of shares subject to the 2020 Program Dabiri RSUs
equaled the number of shares that would have been granted to him pursuant to the 2020 Program RSUs had Dr. Dabiri
been in service as of the 2020 Meeting, but pro-rated to reflect the period of service between the date of appointment of
Dr. Dabiri to the Board and the date of the 2021 Meeting. If Dr. Dabiri’s service terminates due to death, his RSU grants
will immediately fully vest. He does not receive dividend equivalents on unvested RSUs. The grants to Dr. Dabiri occurred
on the sixth business day of the calendar month following the date of his appointment, in alignment with our typical
grant procedures for new employees.
In connection with Dr. Shah’s appointment to the Board in November 2020, she was granted on December 8, 2020: (a) an
initial RSU grant with a value of $225,000, which vests as to 1/6th of the shares approximately every six months, or the
Initial Shah RSUs, and (b) an annual RSU grant equal to the grant value of the 2020 Program RSUs, pro-rated for the
period of time from Dr. Shah’s appointment in November 2020 to the date of our 2021 Meeting, which will vest in full on
May 19, 2021, or the 2020 Program Shah RSUs. The number of shares subject to the Initial Shah RSUs equaled the value
of the grant, divided by the average closing market price of our common stock over the 60 calendar days ending the
business day before Dr. Shah’s appointment to the Board. The number of shares subject to the 2020 Program Shah
RSUs equaled the number of shares that would have been granted to her pursuant to the 2020 Program RSUs had Dr.
Shah been in service as of the 2020 Meeting, but pro-rated to reflect the period of service between the date of
appointment of Dr. Shah to the Board and the date of the 2021 Meeting. If Dr. Shah’s service terminates due to death, her
RSU grants will immediately fully vest. She does not receive dividend equivalents on unvested RSUs. The grants to Dr.

our typical grant procedures for new employees.
Deferral of Settlement
Non-employee directors could elect to defer settlement of RSUs upon vesting for tax planning purposes, to be issued on
the earliest of (a) the date of the director’s “separation from service” (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-1(h)), unless a six month delay would be required under such Section, (b) the date of a change in control of
NVIDIA that also would constitute a “change in control event” (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-3(i)(5)), and (c) the third Wednesday in March of the year elected by the director, which year must have been or
be no earlier than (i) 2022 for the 2020 Program Dabiri RSUs and 2020 Program Shah RSUs, (ii) 2022 for the 2020
Program RSUs, or (ii) 2024 for the Initial Dabiri RSUs and Initial Shah RSUs. Messrs. Jones, McCaffery, and Neal, Dr.
Shah and Ms. Hudson elected to defer settlement of the RSUs granted to them in Fiscal 2021.
Other Compensation/Benefits
Our non-employee directors are reimbursed for expenses incurred in attending Board and committee meetings and
continuing educational programs pursuant to our Corporate Governance Policies. However, we do not offer change-in-
control benefits to our directors, except for the vesting acceleration provisions in our equity plans that apply to all
holders of stock awards under such plans in the event that an acquirer does not assume or substitute for such awards.

Proposal 2—Approval of Executive Compensation
What am I voting on? A non-binding vote, known as “say-on-pay,” to approve our Fiscal 2021 NEO compensation.
Vote required: A majority of the shares present or represented by proxy.
Effect of abstentions: Same as a vote AGAINST.
Effect of broker non-votes: None.
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking our stockholders to vote on an advisory basis,
commonly referred to as “say-on-pay”, to approve the Fiscal 2021 compensation paid to our NEOs as disclosed in the
CD&A, the compensation tables and the related narrative disclosure contained in this proxy statement. This vote is not
intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and the
philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement.
In response to our stockholders’ preference, our Board has adopted a policy of providing for annual “say-on-pay” votes.
This advisory proposal is not binding on the Board or us. Nevertheless, the views expressed by the stockholders,
whether through this vote or otherwise, are important to management and the Board and, accordingly, the Board and
the CC intend to consider the results of this vote in making determinations in the future regarding NEO compensation
arrangements.
Recommendation of the Board
The Board recommends that our stockholders adopt the following resolution:
“RESOLVED, that the Fiscal 2021 compensation paid to the Company’s named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to
Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative
discussion, is hereby APPROVED.”

Executive Compensation
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
This CD&A describes our Fiscal 2021 executive compensation goals, philosophies and program design, including the CC’s
process for determining compensation, the various components of pay, and how our corporate results affected
performance-based payout. Our Fiscal 2021 NEOs were:
Jen-Hsun Huang Colette M. Kress Ajay K. Puri Debora Shoquist Timothy S. Teter
President and CEO EVP and CFO EVP, Worldwide Field EVP, Operations EVP, General Counsel and
Operations Secretary
Fiscal 2021 Executive Compensation Highlights
Despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, in Fiscal 2021, we enhanced our networking technologies by
completing the acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd., launched the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture for our Gaming
and Data Center platforms, and announced a partnership with Mercedes-Benz to introduce software-defined, intelligent
vehicles using end-to-end NVIDIA technology. On the strength of our Gaming and Data Center market platforms, we
achieved record revenue for the Company, which directly impacted the performance payouts under our executive
compensation program.
NVIDIA’s executive compensation program in Fiscal 2021 continued to be guided by a pay for performance philosophy,
and was designed to align NEO compensation with the interests of our stockholders. The overall design of the program
remained consistent year-over-year, with the following Fiscal 2021 NEO pay highlights:
Components of Pay
BASE SALARY + VARIABLE CASH + EQUITY
based on annual revenue RSUs vesting over 4 years (all NEOs other than our CEO)
SY PSUs based on annual Non-GAAP Operating Income,
vesting over 4 years
MY PSUs based on 3-year TSR relative to the S&P 500,
vesting after completion of the performance period
Target Pay Adjustments Performance Achievement; Maximum Payouts
• Increase in proportion of “at-risk” target pay to 94% of • Revenue and Non-GAAP Operating Income each
CEO target pay and 88% of other NEO target pay adjusted to exclude the impact of acquisitions
completed during Fiscal 2021
• Increased CEO target variable cash to 150% of base
salary (representing 25th percentile of peers) Revenue, as adjusted,
Variable cash payout
exceeded Stretch
at 200% of target
• No other changes to NEO base salary or target Operating Plan goal
variable cash for the third consecutive year
• Target equity increased by 51% for CEO and by Non-GAAP Operating 200% (150% for CEO)
111% for other NEOs, after no significant increases in Income, as adjusted, of target PSU shares
the last three years exceeded Stretch eligible to vest
Operating Plan goal
Increased Performance Goals 200% (150% for CEO)
3-year relative TSR
of target PSU shares
• Fiscal 2021 revenue and Non-GAAP Operating Income exceeded Stretch goal
eligible to vest
Threshold goals set above Fiscal 2020 performance
• No adjustments to performance goals due to
COVID-19

Our Compensation Philosophy and Practices
NVIDIA’s mission is to develop revolutionary technology that improves lives. To achieve this vision, we must attract and
retain a high-caliber executive team while balancing our stockholders’ interests. While our CC considers numerous
factors in making executive pay decisions, our compensation program is guided by the following goals and philosophies:
• Pay for Performance: emphasize at-risk and performance-based cash and equity for NEOs based on multiple
corporate metrics
• Provide Competitive Pay: NEO target compensation should be competitive with our peers; reflects job impact,
scope, and responsibilities; and is structured to attract and retain talent
• Stockholder Alignment: structure NEO pay to align with stockholders’ long-term interests and make
adjustments in response to feedback received through our annual stockholder engagement and our annual
“say-on-pay” vote
• Simplicity and Transparency: utilize clear, simple performance metrics that are defined and reported publicly
Our executive compensation program adheres to the following practices:
What We Do What We Don’t Do
üEmphasize at-risk, performance-based compensation, X Enter into agreements with NEOs providing for specific
with objective and distinct goals for each such component terms of employment or severance benefits
üInclude multi-year PSU awards X Give our executive officers special change-in-control
benefits
üUse annual and 3-year performance targets to help
determine SY PSU and MY PSU awards earned, X Provide automatic equity vesting upon a change-in-
respectively control (except for the provisions in our equity plans that
apply to all employees if an acquiring company does not
üRequire NEOs to provide continuous service for 4 years
assume or substitute our outstanding stock awards)
to fully vest in SY PSU and RSU awards
X Give NEOs supplemental retirement benefits or
üEvaluate and adjust our program annually based on
perquisites that are not available to all employees
stockholder and corporate governance group feedback
X Provide tax gross-ups
üMinimize excessive risk-taking
X Reprice stock options without stockholder approval
üCap performance-based variable cash and PSU payouts
X Pay dividends or the equivalent on unearned or
üRetain an independent compensation consultant
unvested equity
reporting directly to the CC
X Permit executive officers, employees or directors to
üRequire NEOs to maintain meaningful stock ownership
hedge their ownership of NVIDIA stock or to pledge
üMaintain a clawback policy for performance-based NVIDIA stock as collateral for a loan
compensation
How We Determine Executive Compensation
Our CC managed our Fiscal 2021 executive compensation program according to the cycle below:
Nov - Dec 2019 Dec 2019 Mar 2020 Mar 2021 Apr 2021
Members of CC CC determined CC certified Completed

Roles of the CC, Compensation Consultant and Management
Our CC solicits the input of Mr. Huang and the CC’s independent compensation consultant, Exequity, which reports
directly to our CC. The roles of our CC, Exequity, and management, including our CEO, CFO, and Human Resources and
Legal departments, in setting our Fiscal 2021 NEO compensation program are summarized below.

At the CC’s direction, Exequity and management recommended a peer group for our program, which was approved by
the CC. Management then gathered peer data from the Radford Global Technology Survey, which was considered by
Exequity in its analysis of Mr. Huang’s compensation, and by Mr. Huang in his recommendations on our other NEOs’
compensation, for Fiscal 2021. The CC considered Exequity’s advice, Mr. Huang’s recommendations, and management’s
proposed Fiscal 2021 performance goals prior to making its final and sole decision on all Fiscal 2021 NEO
compensation. Exequity also advised the CC on the Fiscal 2021 compensation risk analysis prepared by management.
Finally, the CC also certified performance-based compensation payouts for the applicable periods ended Fiscal 2021.
During Fiscal 2021, our CC continued to use Exequity for its experience working with our CC and with compensation
committees at other technology companies. Our CC analyzed whether Exequity’s role raised any conflict of interest,
considering: (i) Exequity does not provide any services directly to NVIDIA (although we pay Exequity on the CC’s behalf),
(ii) the percentage of Exequity’s total revenue resulting from fees paid by us on the CC’s behalf, (iii) Exequity’s conflict of
interest policies and procedures, (iv) any business or personal relationship between Exequity and an NEO, or between
Exequity’s individual compensation advisors and an NEO or any member of our CC, and (v) any NVIDIA stock owned by
Exequity or its individual compensation advisors. After considering these factors, our CC determined that Exequity’s
work did not create any conflict of interest.
Peer Companies and Market Compensation Data
We believe our peers should be companies that (1) compete with us for executive talent; (2) have established businesses,
market presence, and complexity similar to us; and (3) are generally of similar size to us, as measured by revenue and/
or market capitalization at roughly 0.5-3.5x of us. At the time our CC determined our Fiscal 2021 peer group in
December 2019, our revenue and market capitalization, compared to the median of our peer group companies, was as
follows:
Revenue Market Capitalization
Fiscal 2021 Peer Group Median $22.26 billion $122.83 billion
NVIDIA $10.02 billion $130.47 billion
After consultation with management, the CC determined that the existing peer group continued to be appropriate and did
not make changes to our peer group for Fiscal 2021:
Fiscal 2021 Peer Group
Adobe Inc. Cisco Systems, Inc. Intuit Inc. Qualcomm Incorporated Tesla, Inc.
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. IBM Oracle Corporation Salesforce.com, Inc. Texas Instruments
Broadcom Limited Intel Corporation PayPal SAP VMware, Inc.
Our CC reviews market practices and compensation data from the Radford survey for peer companies’ comparably
situated executives when determining the components of our executive compensation program as well as total
compensation. The CC compares the total compensation opportunity for our NEOs and similarly situated executives at
the 50th percentile of peer company data, and also considers the factors below in determining NEO compensation
opportunities.

Factors Used in Determining Executive Compensation
In addition to peer data, our CC considers the following factors in making executive compensation decisions. The weight
given to each factor may differ among NEOs and each component of pay, and is subject to the CC’s sole discretion.
ü The need to attract and retain talent in a highly ü Internal pay equity relative to similarly situated
competitive industry executives and the scope and complexity of the
department(s) or function(s) the NEO manages

Components of Pay
Taking into account (i) the Company’s Fiscal 2021 outlook at the time of determining executive compensation (which
occurred in early March 2021 prior to the full onset of the COVID-19 pandemic), (ii) stockholder feedback from our
annual outreach efforts, and (iii) strong Fiscal 2020 say-on-pay approval, the CC maintained the same elements for our
executive pay program for Fiscal 2021, with some adjustments to further strengthen the link between corporate
performance and NEO pay, including an increase to the proportion of pay that is at-risk. The primary components of
NVIDIA’s Fiscal 2021 executive compensation program are summarized below:

We provide medical, vision, dental, and accidental death and disability insurance as well as time off and paid holidays for
our NEOs, on the same basis as our other employees. Like other employees, our NEOs are eligible to participate in our
2012 ESPP, unless otherwise prohibited by the rules of the Internal Revenue Service, and our 401(k) plan, which
included a Company match of salary deferral contributions of up to $6,500 for calendar 2020, which increased to up to
$7,000 for calendar 2021. For Fiscal 2021, Mr. Puri, Mr. Teter and Ms. Kress each received a $7,000 401(k) match, while
Mr. Huang and Ms. Shoquist each received matches of $6,500.
Compensation Actions and Achievements
Stockholder Outreach and Feedback
We value stockholder feedback and conduct an annual stockholder outreach program. During the Fall of 2019, in
preparing for Fiscal 2021 compensation decisions, we contacted our top institutional holders who held 1% or more of
our stock (with the exception of brokerage firms and index funds who we know do not engage in direct conversations),
with an aggregate ownership of approximately 31% of our common stock outstanding. Members of management and
the Board, including our Lead Director, ultimately discussed executive compensation with representatives of
stockholders holding an aggregate of approximately 19% of our common stock. Our stockholders generally provided
positive feedback on our pay for performance alignment and the simplicity of our executive compensation program
design.
After considering their feedback, and our Fiscal 2020 say-on-pay approval rate of 95%, our CC determined to maintain
the same general elements and metrics for our Fiscal 2021 NEO pay program, but increased the rigor of the corporate
goals and increased the proportion of “at-risk” target pay to further align pay with performance, as described below. In
the Fall of 2020, members of management and the Board, including our Lead Director and a member of our CC, again
engaged in stockholder outreach. The CC considered the feedback from these meetings in making decisions regarding
the current Fiscal 2022 executive compensation program.
Total Target Compensation Approach
Our CC reviewed each NEO’s total target pay opportunity and distribution across different pay elements. Our CC
compared Mr. Huang’s base salary, target variable cash opportunity, target equity opportunity, and total target pay
against chief executives of our peer companies. For our other NEOs, our CC reviewed their respective total target pay
against similarly situated executives of our peer companies. The CC also considered the factors discussed above in
Factors Used in Determining Executive Compensation and the CC’s specific compensation objectives for Fiscal 2021. Our
CC did not use a single formula or assign a specific weight to any one factor in determining each NEO’s target pay.
Instead, our CC used its business judgment and experience to set total target compensation, mix of cash and equity, and
fixed and at-risk pay opportunities for each NEO to achieve our program’s objectives. When the CC set each element of
pay for an NEO, it considered the context of the levels of the other pay elements, and the resulting total target pay for
such NEO. These amounts and structure allowed our NEOs to realize above-market value from equity awards and
variable cash incentives only upon exceptional corporate performance.
For Fiscal 2021, the CC considered that NEO target pay had been kept essentially flat for the last three years, and made
adjustments to better align each NEO’s total target pay with those of similarly situated executives at our peer
companies. As a result, Mr. Huang’s total target pay increased by approximately 46% and each other NEO’s total target
pay increased by an average of 76%, with all increases pertaining to at-risk pay opportunities only.
While the CC generally made no changes to base salary and target variable cash compared to the prior year, it did
increase Mr. Huang’s target variable cash to 150% of his base salary, which brought his target variable cash
compensation, as a percentage of his base salary, to the 25th percentile of peer company chief executive officers. For
our other NEOs, the CC increased their respective target equity opportunities due to their increased responsibilities and
scope, to better align their pay with those of peer executives, as well as to provide for retention.
Continued Emphasis on Long-Term, At-Risk, Performance-Based Equity Awards
For Fiscal 2021, the CC decided that the largest portion of NEOs’ total target pay would remain in the form of at-risk,
performance-based equity. The CC believes an emphasis on long-term, at-risk opportunities drives results and
increases NEO and stockholder alignment, while providing sufficient annual cash compensation to be competitive and
retain our NEOs. The PSUs and RSUs provide long-term incentives and retention benefits because our NEOs must
achieve, for PSUs, the predetermined performance goal and also, for both PSUs and RSUs, remain with us for a multi-
year period (3 years for MY PSUs and 4 years for SY PSUs and RSUs) to fully vest in the awards.
47

--- Page 69 ---

The CC concluded that, given Mr. Huang’s position as CEO, 100% of his equity grants should be at-risk and performance-
based, tightly aligning his interests with stockholders. Consistent with its practice in recent years, the CC granted Mr.
Huang’s target equity opportunity 100% in the form of SY PSUs (which value is aligned with Non-GAAP Operating Income
performance) and MY PSUs (which value is aligned with relative stock price performance). For each of our other NEOs,
the CC provided 40% of the target equity opportunity in the form of RSUs and 60% of the target equity opportunity in the
form of PSUs. The CC, after considering our CEO’s recommendations, determined this mix provided an appropriate
balance, by placing a greater emphasis on awards contingent upon performance goal achievement while still providing a
meaningful amount of time-vesting RSUs to encourage retention and to reward our other NEOs, in line with our stock
performance over the long-term.
The CC evaluated market positioning, internal pay equity, individual performance, and level of unvested equity to
determine a target equity opportunity value for our NEOs. Because our CEO’s target equity opportunity value had been
kept constant for the preceding three years, the CC felt it was appropriate to increase the value for Fiscal 2021 to bring
that portion of pay closer to the median of peer company chief executive officers, representing an increase of 51% from
Fiscal 2020. The target equity opportunity values for our other NEOs represented an average increase of 111% from
Fiscal 2020, which the CC felt was appropriate due to their increased responsibilities and scope, to bring those portions
of pay closer to the median of peer company executives, as well as to provide for retention. To determine actual shares
awarded, the CC used the eight-week trailing average of our stock price ending the week prior to the date of grant,
reducing the impact of daily volatility on compensation decisions. This average stock price determined the number of
RSUs and the target numbers of SY PSUs and MY PSUs.
The target numbers of SY PSU and MY PSU shares were eligible to vest upon our achievement of the Base Operating
Plan Non-GAAP Operating Income performance goal for Fiscal 2021, and the Target TSR performance goal relative to
the S&P 500 over a 3-year period starting at the beginning of Fiscal 2021, respectively. No shares were eligible to vest if
at least Threshold performance was not achieved. Shares underlying any PSUs that are not earned are cancelled.
If the Company achieved at least Threshold performance, the minimum number of shares eligible to vest was 50% of the
SY PSU target opportunity and 25% of the MY PSU target opportunity. If the Company achieved at least Stretch
Operating Plan performance for SY PSUs (or Stretch performance for MY PSUs), the maximum number of shares eligible
to vest was capped at 150% of Mr. Huang’s, and 200% of our other NEOs’ respective, PSU target opportunities.

Goals for and Achievement of Performance-Based Compensation
Based on the Fiscal 2021 strategic plan as approved by the Board, the CC set performance metrics and goals, and
certified the Company’s performance achievement with resulting payouts to our NEOs, as set forth below:

* Revenue, on an adjusted basis, is GAAP revenue, as the Company reports in its respective earnings materials, excluding the impact of acquisitions
completed during the applicable fiscal year. Non-GAAP Operating Income, on an adjusted basis, is GAAP operating income as the Company reports
in its respective earnings materials, excluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related costs, legal settlement costs and other costs,
and the estimated unaudited operating income and costs associated with acquisitions completed during the applicable fiscal year.
Each of the performance goal levels as described above were set by the CC with the following objectives:
• Threshold was uncertain, but attainable and high enough to create modest value; represented an appropriately
decelerated payout for performance below Base Operating Plan (Target for MY PSUs)
• Base Operating Plan (Target for MY PSU) was uncertain but attainable with significant effort and execution
success; included budgeted investments in future businesses and revenue growth (and for PSUs, gross margin
growth) considering macroeconomic conditions and reasonable but challenging growth estimates for ongoing
and new businesses
• Stretch Operating Plan (Stretch for MY PSU) required exceptional achievement; only possible with strong
market factors and a very high level of management execution and corporate performance

At the time the CC established the Fiscal 2021 goals, the Company had executed a definitive agreement to acquire
Mellanox. However, due to uncertainty around the likelihood and timing of the receipt of required regulatory approvals
as well as regarding the closing of the transaction, the CC believed that in order to best align our executives’ interests
with those of our stockholders and to remain consistent with our pay for performance philosophy, the Fiscal 2021
performance goals should exclude the additional revenue and estimated unaudited operating income and costs
generated by the acquisition of Mellanox and other acquisitions completed during Fiscal 2021.
In accordance with the performance goals and methodology established by the CC in early Fiscal 2021, the CC excluded
the additional revenue and the estimated unaudited operating income and costs generated by acquisitions completed
during Fiscal 2021 in its certification of Fiscal 2021 results. Such exclusion had the effect of reducing the overall levels
of revenue and Non-GAAP Operating Income. The CC determined the foregoing approach best aligned our executives’
interests with those of our stockholders and remained consistent with our pay for performance philosophy.
Achievement of goals for Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2021 MY PSU grants will be determined after January 2022 and January
2023, respectively.
Target Fiscal 2021 Compensation Actions
The CC’s target Fiscal 2021 compensation actions are summarized below for each NEO, reflecting the target value of the
variable cash and equity opportunities the CC intended to deliver, as well as the variable cash earned and PSUs which
became eligible to vest. The CC considered the factors set forth in Factors Used in Determining Executive Compensation

Additional Executive Compensation Practices, Policies, and Procedures
Stock Ownership Guidelines
The Board believes that executive officers should hold a significant equity interest in NVIDIA. Our Corporate Governance
Policies require the CEO to hold shares of our common stock valued at six times his base salary, and our other NEOs to
hold shares of our common stock valued at the NEO’s respective base salary. NEOs have up to five years from
appointment to reach the ownership threshold. The stock ownership guidelines are intended to further align NEO
interests with stockholder interests. Each NEO currently exceeds the stock ownership requirements.
Compensation Recovery (“Clawback”) Policy
We maintain a Compensation Recovery Policy for all employees. Under this policy, if we are required to prepare an
accounting restatement to correct an accounting error on an interim or annual financial statement included in a report
on Form 10-Q or Form 10-K due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the federal
securities laws, or a Restatement, and if the Board or a committee of independent directors concludes that our CEO, our
CFO or any other employee received a variable compensation payment that would not have been payable if the original
interim or annual financial statements had reflected the Restatement, which we refer to as the Overpayment, then:
• Our CEO and our CFO will disgorge the net after-tax portion of the Overpayment; and
• The Board or the committee of independent directors in its sole discretion may require any other employee to
repay the Overpayment. In using its discretion, the Board or the independent committee may consider whether
such person was involved in the preparation of our financial statements or otherwise caused the need for the
Restatement and may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, recoup amounts by (1) requiring partial or full
repayment by such person of any variable or incentive compensation or any gains realized on the exercise of
stock options or on the open-market sale of vested shares, (2) canceling up to all and any outstanding equity
awards held by such person and/or (3) adjusting the future compensation of such person.
We will review and update the Compensation Recovery Policy as necessary for compliance with the clawback policy
provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act when the final regulations related to that
policy are issued.
Tax and Accounting Implications
Under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, or Section 162(m), compensation paid to each of the Company’s
“covered employees” that exceeds $1 million per taxable year is generally non-deductible unless the compensation
qualifies for certain grandfathered exceptions (including the “performance-based compensation” exception) for certain
compensation paid pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017 and not materially modified on
or after such date.
51

--- Page 73 ---

Although the CC will continue to consider tax implications as one factor in determining executive compensation, the CC
also looks at other factors in making its decisions and retains the flexibility to provide compensation for the NEOs in a
manner consistent with the goals of the Company’s executive compensation program and the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders, which may include providing for compensation that is not deductible by the Company due
to the deduction limit under Section 162(m). The CC also retains the flexibility to modify compensation that was initially
intended to be exempt from the deduction limit under Section 162(m) if it determines that such modifications are
consistent with the Company’s business needs.
Our CC also considers the impact of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, and in general, our executive plans and
programs are designed to comply with the requirements of that section to avoid the possible adverse tax consequences
that may arise from non-compliance.
Under FASB ASC Topic 718, the Company is required to estimate and record an expense for each award of equity

according to FASB ASC Topic 718.
Risk Analysis of Our Compensation Plans
With the oversight of the CC, members from the Company’s Legal, Human Resources and Finance departments, as well
as Exequity, the independent consultant engaged by the CC, performed an assessment of the Company’s compensation
programs and policies for Fiscal 2021 as generally applicable to our employees to ascertain any potential material risks
that may be created by our compensation programs. The assessment focused on programs with variability of payout
and the ability of participants to directly affect payout and the controls over participant action and payout—specifically,
the Company’s variable cash compensation, equity compensation, and sales incentive compensation programs. We
identified the key terms of these programs, potential concerns regarding risk taking behavior, and specific risk
mitigation features. The assessment was first presented to our Senior Vice President, Human Resources; our CFO; and
our General Counsel, and then presented to the CC.
The CC considered the findings of the assessment described above and concluded that our compensation programs,
which are structured to recognize both short-term and long-term contributions to the Company, do not create risks
which are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.
The CC believes that the following compensation design features guard against excessive risk-taking:
Our compensation program encourages our employees to remain focused on both our short-term and long-
ü
term goals
We design our variable cash and PSU compensation programs for executives so that payouts are based on
ü
achievement of corporate performance targets, and we cap the potential award payout
We have internal controls over our financial accounting and reporting which is used to measure and
ü
determine the eligible compensation awards under our Variable Cash Plan and our SY PSUs
Financial plan target goals and final awards under our Variable Cash Plan and our SY PSUs are approved by
ü
the CC and consistent with the annual operating plan approved by the full Board each year
ü MY PSUs are designed with a relative goal
We have a compensation recovery policy applicable to all employees that allows NVIDIA to recover
ü
compensation paid in situations of fraud or material financial misconduct
ü All executive officer equity awards have multi-year vesting
We have stock ownership guidelines that we believe are reasonable and are designed to align our executive
ü
officers’ interests with those of our stockholders
We enforce a “no-hedging” policy and a “no-pledging” policy involving our common stock which prevents our
ü
employees from insulating themselves from the effects of NVIDIA stock price performance

Employment, Severance and Change-in-Control Arrangements
Employment Agreements. Our executive officers are “at-will” employees and we do not have employment, severance or
change-in-control agreements with our executive officers.
Change-in-Control Arrangements. Our 2007 Plan provides that in the event of a corporate transaction or a change-in-
control, outstanding stock awards may be assumed, continued, or substituted by the surviving corporation. If the
surviving corporation does not assume, continue, or substitute such stock awards, then (a) with respect to any stock
awards that are held by individuals performing services for NVIDIA immediately prior to the effective time of the
transaction, the vesting and exercisability provisions of such stock awards will be accelerated in full and such stock
awards will be terminated if not exercised prior to the effective date of the corporate transaction or change-in-control,
and (b) all other outstanding stock awards will be terminated if not exercised on or prior to the effective date of the
corporate transaction or change-in-control.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control
Upon a change-in-control or certain other corporate transactions of NVIDIA, unvested RSUs and PSUs will fully vest in
some cases as described above under Employment, Severance and Change-in-Control Arrangements—Change-in-Control
Arrangements. The table below shows our estimates of the amount of the benefit each of our NEOs would have received
if the unvested RSUs and PSUs held by them as of January 31, 2021 had become fully vested as a result of a change-in-
control, calculated by multiplying the number of unvested RSUs and PSUs held by the applicable NEO by the $519.59
closing price of our common stock on January 29, 2021.

tables below reflect the actual numbers of the SY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2021 and MY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2019 that would be eligible to vest,
based on our performance during the relevant performance period for such awards, as certified by our CC shortly after the end of Fiscal 2021. The

Pay Ratio
In accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, promulgated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act, we determined the ratio of: (a) the annual total compensation of our CEO, to (b) the median of the annual
total compensation of all our employees, except for our CEO, both calculated in accordance with the requirements of
Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K.
To determine the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees, except for our CEO, for Fiscal 2021,
we used a consistently applied compensation measure which aggregated, for each employee employed by us on the last
business day of Fiscal 2021, or January 29, 2021: (i) target base salary as of January 29, 2021 (annualized for
permanent employees who were employed by us for less than the entire fiscal year), (ii) variable cash earned during
Fiscal 2021, and (iii) aggregate full grant date fair value of equity awards granted during Fiscal 2021, calculated in
accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 and assuming the probable outcome of the conditions at Base Operating Plan for
performance-based awards. Compensation paid in foreign currencies was converted to U.S. dollars based on exchange
rates in effect on January 29, 2021.
After applying the methodology described above, we determined the identity of our median employee for Fiscal 2021,
whose compensation for Fiscal 2021 was $215,930. Our CEO’s compensation for Fiscal 2021 was $19,316,401.
Therefore, our Fiscal 2021 CEO to median employee pay ratio was 89:1.
This pay ratio represents our reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K
and applicable guidance, which provide significant flexibility in how companies identify the median employee. Each
company may use a different methodology and make different assumptions. As a result, and as explained by the SEC
when it adopted these rules, in considering the pay ratio disclosure, stockholders should keep in mind that the rule was
not designed to facilitate comparisons of pay ratios among different companies, even companies within the same
industry, but rather to allow stockholders to better understand and assess each particular company’s compensation
practices and pay ratio disclosures. Neither the CC nor our management used our Fiscal 2021 CEO to median employee
pay ratio in making compensation decisions.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
At the beginning of Fiscal 2021, the CC initially consisted of Messrs. Burgess, Coxe, Jones, and Seawell and Dr. Drell.
After the 2020 Meeting, the CC became composed of Messrs. Burgess, Coxe, and Jones and Dr. Drell. No member of the
CC is an officer or employee of NVIDIA, and none of our executive officers serve as a director or member of a
compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our Board or CC.
Compensation Committee Report
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the compensation programs of NVIDIA on behalf of the
Board of Directors. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed with
management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis included in this proxy statement.
In reliance on the review and discussions referred to above, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of
Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of NVIDIA for
the year ended January 31, 2021 and in this proxy statement.

Proposal 3—Ratification of the Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for Fiscal 2022
What am I voting on? Ratification of the selection of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for
Fiscal 2022.
Vote required: A majority of the shares present or represented by proxy.
Effect of abstentions: Same as a vote AGAINST.
Effect of broker non-votes: None (because this is a routine proposal, there are no broker non-votes).
The AC has selected PwC, which has audited our financial statements annually since 2004, to serve as our independent
registered public accounting firm for Fiscal 2022. Our lead audit partner at PwC serves no more than five consecutive
years in that role. Stockholder ratification of the AC’s selection of PwC is not required by our Bylaws or any other
governing documents or laws. As a matter of good corporate governance, we are submitting the selection of PwC to our
stockholders for ratification. If our stockholders do not ratify the selection, the AC will reconsider whether or not to
retain PwC. Even if the selection is ratified, the AC in its sole discretion may direct the appointment of a different
independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the fiscal year if it determines that such a change
would be in our best interests and those of our stockholders. The AC believes it is in the best interests of NVIDIA and our
stockholders to retain PwC.
We expect that a representative of PwC will attend the 2021 Meeting. The PwC representative will have an opportunity to
make a statement at the 2021 Meeting if he or she so desires and will also be available to respond to appropriate
stockholder questions.
Recommendation of the Board
The Board recommends that you vote FOR the ratification of the selection of PwC as our independent registered
accounting firm for our fiscal year ending January 30, 2022.

Fees Billed by the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The following is a summary of fees billed by PwC for Fiscal 2021 and 2020 for audit, tax and other professional services
during each fiscal year:
Fiscal 2021 Fiscal 2020
Audit Fees (1) $ 6,283,381 $ 5,028,120
Tax Fees (2) 609,281 208,062
All Other Fees (3) 7,200 4,500
Total Fees $ 6,899,862 $ 5,240,682
(1) Audit fees include fees for the audit of our consolidated financial statements, including business combination activities during the year, the audit
of our internal control over financial reporting, reviews of our quarterly financial statements and annual report, reviews of SEC registration
statements and related consents, review of an SEC filing for public debt financing and related comfort letter, and fees related to statutory audits
of some of our international entities.
(2) Tax fees consisted of fees for tax compliance and consultation services.
(3) All other fees consisted of fees for products or services other than those included above, including payment to PwC related to the use of
accounting research software and an industry report.
All of the services provided for Fiscal 2021 and 2020 described above were pre-approved by the AC or the Chairperson
of the AC through the authority granted to him by the AC, which is described below. Our AC determined that the
rendering of services other than audit services by PwC was compatible with maintaining PwC’s independence.
Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
The AC has adopted policies and procedures for the pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services
rendered by our independent registered public accounting firm. The policy generally permits pre-approvals of specified
permissible services in the defined categories of audit services, audit-related services and tax services up to specified
amounts. Pre-approval may also be given as part of the AC’s approval of the scope of the engagement of our
independent registered public accounting firm or on an individual case-by-case basis before the independent registered
public accounting firm is engaged to provide each service. In some cases the full AC provides pre-approval for up to a
year related to a particular defined task or scope. In other cases, the AC has delegated power to Mr. McCaffery, the
Chairperson of our AC, to pre-approve additional non-audit services if the need for the service was unanticipated and
approval is required prior to the next scheduled meeting of the AC. Mr. McCaffery then communicates such pre-approval
to the full AC at its next meeting.

Report of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
The material in this report is not “soliciting material,” is not deemed “filed” with the SEC and is not to be incorporated by
reference in any of our filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, whether made before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in any such
filing, except to the extent specifically incorporated by reference therein.
The Audit Committee, or AC, oversees accounting, financial reporting, internal control over financial reporting, financial
practices and audit activities of NVIDIA and its subsidiaries. The AC reviews the results and scope of the audit and other
services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm and reviews financial statements and the
accounting policies followed by NVIDIA prior to the issuance of the financial statements with both management and the
independent registered public accounting firm.
Management is responsible for the financial reporting process, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, the system of internal control
over financial reporting, and the procedures designed to facilitate compliance with accounting standards and applicable
laws and regulations. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or PwC, our independent registered public accounting firm for
Fiscal 2021, was responsible for performing an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements and issuing a
report on the consolidated financial statements and of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of January 31, 2021. PwC’s judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of our accounting principles and
such other matters are required to be disclosed to the AC under applicable standards. The AC oversees these processes.
Also, the AC has ultimate authority and responsibility to select, evaluate and, when appropriate, terminate the
independent registered public accounting firm. The AC approves audit fees and non-audit services provided by and fees
paid to the independent registered public accounting firm.
NVIDIA has an internal audit function that reports to the AC. This function is responsible for objectively reviewing and
evaluating the adequacy, effectiveness and quality of our system of internal controls and the operating effectiveness of
our business processes. The AC approves an annual internal audit plan and monitors the activities and performance of
our internal audit function throughout the year to ensure the plan objectives are carried out and met.
The AC members are not professional accountants or auditors, and their functions are not intended to duplicate or to
certify the activities of management or the independent registered public accounting firm. The AC does not plan or
conduct audits, determine that our financial statements are complete and accurate and in accordance with GAAP or
assess our internal control over financial reporting. The AC relies, without additional independent verification, on the
information provided by our management and on the representations made by management that the financial
statements have been prepared with integrity and objectivity, and the opinion of PwC that such financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with GAAP.
In this context, the AC reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements for Fiscal 2021 with
management and our internal control over financial reporting with management and PwC. Specifically, the AC discussed
with PwC the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board and the SEC. We have received from PwC the written disclosures and letter required by the applicable
requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding PwC’s communications with the AC
concerning independence. The AC also considered whether the provision of certain permitted non-audit services by PwC
is compatible with PwC’s independence and discussed PwC’s independence with PwC.
Based on the AC’s review and discussions, the AC recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated
financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of NVIDIA for the fiscal year ended January 31,
2021.

Proposal 4—Approval of an Amendment to our Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation to Increase the Number of Authorized Shares of Common Stock
from 2 Billion Shares to 4 Billion Shares
What am I voting on? Approval of an amendment to our Charter to increase the number of authorized shares of
common stock from 2 billion shares to 4 billion shares.
Vote required: A majority of the shares outstanding.
Effect of abstentions: Same as a vote AGAINST.
Effect of broker non-votes: Same as a vote AGAINST.
For purposes of this Proposal 4, the term “Proposed Amendment” refers to an amendment and restatement of our
Charter.
Description of the Proposed Amendment
Our Charter currently authorizes the issuance of up to two billion shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share,
and two million shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.
On April 7, 2021, our Board adopted resolutions approving an amendment to the Charter to increase the number of
authorized shares of common stock from two billion shares to four billion shares. Our Board is recommending the
proposed increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock to provide adequate shares of common stock
for general corporate purposes, as further described below. The Board determined that the Proposed Amendment is
advisable and in the best interests of the Company and directed that the proposed Amendment be submitted for
adoption and approval by stockholders at the Meeting.
The full text of the Proposed Amendment is set forth in Appendix A to this Proxy Statement. The Proposed Amendment
would not affect the number of authorized shares of preferred stock. Currently, there are no shares of preferred stock
issued and outstanding.
Purposes and Effect of the Proposed Amendment and Effect of Stockholder Approval
As of April 5, 2021, we have 622,383,615 shares of common stock outstanding and the number of authorized shares of
our common stock is two billion. Following the filing of the Proposed Amendment, the number of authorized shares of
our common stock will be increased to four billion.
If our stockholders adopt and approve the Proposed Amendment, the Proposed Amendment will become effective on the
date that it is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. If the Proposed Amendment is adopted and
approved by the stockholders, the Company currently anticipates filing the Proposed Amendment with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware on or around June 4, 2021. If the Proposed Amendment is not adopted and approved by
the stockholders or is subsequently abandoned by the Board, the Proposed Amendment will not be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and our authorized number of shares of common stock will remain at two
billion. Further, if the Board subsequently determines not to proceed with the filing of the Proposed Amendment, it will
not be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware even if it is approved by stockholders.
As a general matter, the increase in our authorized but unissued shares of common stock as a result of the Proposed
Amendment would enable the Board to issue additional shares of common stock in its discretion from time to time for
general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, expanding our business through mergers and acquisitions,
including shares we would be obligated to issue in connection with the pending acquisition of Arm Limited; stock
dividends and/or stock splits; providing equity incentives to employees, officers or directors; and the raising of additional
capital. Such issuances would occur without further action or approval of our stockholders and would be subject to and
limited by any rules or listing requirements of Nasdaq or of any other applicable rules or regulations. Except for shares
of common stock reserved for grant(s) pursuant to our equity compensation plans, the Company does not currently have
any other plans, agreements, commitments or understandings with respect to the issuance of the additional shares (or
the currently authorized but unissued shares) of common stock, nor does the Company currently have any plans,
arrangements, commitments or understandings with respect to the issuance of any shares of preferred stock.
Failure by the stockholders to approve the Proposed Amendment would reduce the ability of the Board to take the
potential future actions to issue additional common stock discussed above.
63

--- Page 85 ---

Any additional authorized shares of common stock, if and when issued, would be part of our existing class of common
stock, and would have the same rights and privileges as the currently outstanding shares of common stock. The holders
of common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or cumulative voting.
Effective Date of Proposed Amendment
If the Proposed Amendment is adopted by the required vote of stockholders, it will become effective on the date the
Proposed Amendment is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which we anticipate will be on or
around June 4, 2021.
Reservation of Right to Abandon Proposed Amendment
Our Board reserves the right to not proceed with the Proposed Amendment and to abandon the Proposed Amendment
without further action by our stockholders at any time before the effectiveness of the filing of the Proposed Amendment
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, even if the Proposed Amendment is adopted and approved by our
stockholders at the Meeting. By voting in favor of the Proposed Amendment, you are expressly also authorizing our
Board to delay, not proceed with, and abandon, the Proposed Amendment if it should so decide, in its sole discretion,
that such action is in the best interests of our Company and its stockholders. If the Board elects to abandon the
Proposed Amendment, the number of authorized shares of common stock will remain at two billion.
Recommendation of the Board
The Board recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the Proposed Amendment to increase the number of
authorized shares of common stock from two billion shares to four billion shares.

PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original
focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by
the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU
architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, artificial intelligence, or AI, data science, autonomous vehicles,
or AV, robotics, and augmented and virtual reality, or AR and VR.
The GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. Today,
it also simulates human intelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing
capabilities, supported by up to thousands of computing cores, are essential to running deep learning algorithms. This
form of AI, in which software writes itself by learning from data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots and self-
driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered deep learning is being adopted by thousands of
enterprises to deliver services and products that would have been impossible with traditional coding.
NVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, software, algorithms, libraries, systems, and services to
create unique value for the markets we serve. While the requirements of these end markets are diverse, we address
them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and software stacks. The programmable nature of our
architecture allows us to support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by using
a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. The large and growing
number of developers across our platforms strengthens our ecosystem and increases the value of our platform to our
customers.
Innovation is at our core. We have invested over $24 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding
inventions that are essential to modern computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 defined modern computer graphics
and established NVIDIA as the leader in visual computing. With our introduction of the CUDA programming model in
2006, we opened the parallel processing capabilities of the GPU for general purpose computing. This approach
significantly accelerates the most demanding high-performance computing, or HPC, applications in fields such as
aerospace, bio-science research, mechanical and fluid simulations, and energy exploration. Today, our GPUs power
many of the fastest supercomputers across the world. In addition, the massively parallel compute architecture of our
GPUs and associated software are well suited for deep learning and machine learning, powering the era of AI. While
traditional CPU-based approaches no longer deliver advances on the pace described by Moore’s Law, we deliver GPU
performance improvements on a pace ahead of Moore’s Law, giving the industry a path forward.
Gamers choose NVIDIA GPUs to enjoy immersive, increasingly cinematic virtual worlds. GPUs also help underpin the
world’s fastest growing spectator sport, eSports, which attracts hundreds of millions of viewers to watch top-quality
gaming. In addition to serving the growing number of gamers, the market for gaming GPUs is expanding as a result of
the burgeoning population of live streamers, broadcasters, artists and creators.
Researchers use our GPUs to accelerate a wide range of important applications, from simulating molecular dynamics to
weather forecasting. With support for more than over 600 applications - including the top 15 HPC applications - NVIDIA
GPUs enable some of the most promising areas of discovery, from weather prediction to materials science and from
wind tunnel simulation to genomics. NVIDIA GPUs power the top supercomputers in the United States and Europe.
Including GPUs and networking, NVIDIA powers nearly 70%, and 8 of the top 10, supercomputers on the global TOP500
list.
The world’s leading cloud service providers and consumer internet companies use our GPUs to enable, accelerate or
enrich the services they deliver to billions of end-users, including search, social networking, online shopping, live video,
translation, AI assistants, navigation, and cloud computing.
A rapidly growing number of enterprises and startups across a broad range of industries use our GPUs and AI software
to bring automation to the products and services they build. For example, the transportation industry is turning to our
platforms for AV; the healthcare industry is leveraging them for enhanced medical imaging and accelerated drug
discovery; and the financial services industry is using them for fraud detection.
Professional designers use our GPUs to create visual effects in movies and design products ranging from soft drink
bottles to commercial aircraft.

Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in
Delaware in April 1998.
Pending Acquisition of Arm Limited
On September 13, 2020, we entered into a Share Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Arm Limited, or
Arm, and SoftBank Group Capital Limited and SVF Holdco (UK) Limited, or together, SoftBank, for us to acquire, from
SoftBank, all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion. The announced acquisition
is expected to bring together NVIDIA's leading AI computing platform with Arm's vast ecosystem to create the premier
computing company for the age of artificial intelligence, accelerating innovation while expanding into large, high-growth
markets. We paid $2 billion in cash at signing, or the Signing Consideration, and will pay upon closing of the acquisition
$10 billion in cash and issue to SoftBank 44.3 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of
$21.5 billion. The transaction includes a potential earn out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial
performance targets by Arm during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. If the financial targets are achieved, SoftBank
can elect to receive either up to an additional $5 billion in cash or up to an additional 10.3 million shares of our common
stock. We will issue up to $1.5 billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $2 billion paid upon
signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $1.36 billion and the prepayment of
intellectual property licenses from Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of $0.47 billion, both with a 20-year term. The
closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and
regulatory consents and approvals and expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation of
the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. We are engaged
with regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions. If the
Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we will be refunded $1.25 billion of the Signing
Consideration. The $2 billion payment upon signing was allocated on a fair value basis and any refund of the Signing
Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement. We believe the closing of the acquisition will likely
occur in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.

We specialize in markets in which our computing platforms can provide tremendous acceleration for applications. These
platforms incorporate processors, interconnects, software, algorithms, systems, and services to deliver value that is
unique in the marketplace. Our platforms address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Gaming,
Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive.
Gaming
Computer gaming is the largest entertainment industry. Many factors propel computer gaming’s growth, including new
high production value games and franchises, the continued rise of competitive gaming or eSports, social connectivity
and the demand for more content from game streamers, modders and creators.
Our gaming platforms leverage our GPUs and sophisticated software to enhance the gaming experience with smoother,
higher quality graphics. This includes GeForce Experience, our gaming application that optimizes the PC user’s settings
for each application and enables gamers to record and share gameplay.
We developed NVIDIA RTX bringing next generation graphics and AI to games. The NVIDIA RTX line-up features ray
tracing technology for real-time, cinematic-quality rendering. Ray tracing, which has long been used for special effects
in the movie industry, is a computationally intensive technique that simulates the physical behavior of light to achieve
greater realism in computer-generated scenes. NVIDIA RTX also features deep learning super sampling, or DLSS, our AI
technology that boosts frame rates while generating beautiful, sharp images for games.
5

--- Page 95 ---

Our products for the gaming market include GeForce RTX and GeForce GTX GPUs for PC gaming, SHIELD devices for
gaming and streaming, GeForce NOW for cloud-based gaming, as well as platforms and development services for
specialized console gaming devices.
Professional Visualization
We serve the Professional Visualization market by working closely with independent software vendors to optimize their
offerings for NVIDIA GPUs. Our GPU computing solutions enhance productivity and introduce new capabilities for critical
parts of the workflow for such major industries as automotive, media and entertainment, architectural engineering, oil
and gas, and medical imaging.
Designers who build the products we use every day need the images that they view digitally to mirror reality. This
requires simulating the physical behavior of light and materials, or physically-based rendering. Our DesignWorks
software delivers this to designers and enables an architect designing a building with a computer-aided design package
to interact with the model in real time, view it in greater detail, and generate photorealistic renderings for the client. It
also allows an automotive designer to create a highly realistic 3D image of a car, which can be viewed from all angles,
reducing reliance on costly, time-consuming full-scale clay models.
Our Professional Visualization platforms are critical enablers in many fields, such as design and manufacturing and
digital content creation. Design and manufacturing encompass computer-aided design, architectural design, consumer-
products manufacturing, medical instrumentation, and aerospace. Digital content creation includes professional video
editing and post-production, special effects for films, and broadcast-television graphics.
The NVIDIA RTX platform makes it possible to render film-quality, photorealistic objects and environments with
physically accurate shadows, reflections and refractions using ray tracing in real-time. Many leading 3D design and
content creation applications developed by our ecosystem partners now support RTX, allowing professionals to
accelerate and transform their workflows with NVIDIA RTX GPUs.
Just as VR is becoming more important in gaming, it is also being incorporated in a growing number of enterprise
applications. Virtual car showrooms, surgical training, architectural walkthroughs, and bringing historical scenes to life
all deploy this technology, powered by our GPUs.
Data Center
The NVIDIA computing platform is focused on accelerating the most compute-intensive workloads, such as AI, data
analytics, graphics and scientific computing, across hyperscale, cloud, enterprise, public sector, and edge data centers.
The platform consists of our energy efficient GPUs, interconnects and systems, our CUDA programming model, and a
growing body of software libraries, Software Development Kits, or SDKs, application frameworks and services.
In the field of AI, NVIDIA’s platform accelerates both deep learning and machine learning workloads. Deep learning is a
computer science approach where neural networks are trained to recognize patterns from massive amounts of data in
the form of images, sounds and text - in some instances better than humans. Machine learning is a related approach
that leverages algorithms as well as data to learn how to make determinations or predictions, often used in data
science. HPC, also referred to as scientific computing, uses numerical computational approaches to solve large and
complex problems. For both AI and HPC applications, the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform greatly increases the
performance and power efficiency of high-performance computers and data centers.
We are engaged with thousands of organizations working on AI in a multitude of industries, from automating tasks such
as reading medical images, to enabling fraud detection in financial services, to optimizing oil exploration and drilling.
These organizations include the world’s leading consumer internet and cloud services companies, which are using AI for
critical tasks such as natural language processing and recommendation systems; enterprises that are increasingly
turning to AI to improve products and services; and startups seeking to implement AI in transformative ways across
multiple industries. We partnered with industry leaders such as IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, and VMware to bring AI to
enterprise users. We also have partnerships in transportation, retail, healthcare and manufacturing, among others, to
accelerate the adoption of AI.
At the foundation of the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform are our GPUs, which excel at parallel workloads such as
the training and inferencing of neural networks. They are available in industry standard servers from every major
computer maker worldwide, including Cisco, Dell, HP, Inspur, and Lenovo; from every major cloud service provider such
as Alicloud, Amazon Web Services, Baidu Cloud, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud; as well as
in our DGX AI supercomputer, a purpose-built system for deep learning and GPU accelerated applications. To facilitate
customer adoption, we have also built other ready-to-use systems and reference designs around our GPUs, including
6

HGX for hyperscale and supercomputing data centers, EGX for enterprise and edge computing, and AGX for autonomous
machines.
In fiscal year 2021, we completed the acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd., or Mellanox, a supplier of high-
performance interconnect and networking products that are now part of our Data Center market platform. Mellanox
interconnects are included in our DGX, HGX and EGX platforms and continue to be available on a standalone basis. With
Mellanox, we can optimize across the entire computing, networking, and storage stack to deliver data center-scale
computing solutions. For example, we announced a new class of processor – the data processing unit, or DPU –
supported by a novel data-center-infrastructure-on-a-chip architecture, or DOCA, that enables breakthrough networking,
storage and security performance.
While our approach starts with powerful chips, what makes it a computing platform is our large body of software,
including the CUDA parallel programming model, the CUDA-X collection of application acceleration libraries, Application
Programming Interfaces, or APIs, SDKs and tools, and domain-specific application frameworks. We also offer the NVIDIA
GPU Cloud registry, or NGC, a comprehensive catalog of easy-to-use, optimized software stacks across a range of
domains including scientific computing, deep learning, and machine learning. With NGC, AI developers, researchers and
data scientists can get started with the development of AI and HPC applications and deploy them on DGX systems, NGC-
ready workstations or servers from our systems partners, or with NVIDIA’s cloud partners such as Amazon Web
Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, or Oracle Cloud.
We also serve the data center market with NVIDIA virtual GPU (vGPU) software products that enable powerful GPU
performance for workloads ranging from graphics-rich virtual desktops and workstations to data science and AI.
Installed on a physical GPU in a cloud or enterprise data center server, NVIDIA vGPU software creates virtual GPUs that
can be shared across multiple virtual machines accessed on any device, anywhere. With companies supporting more
offsite workers than ever before, NVIDIA vGPU software products are enabling remote access to professional graphics
and accelerated computing for data scientists, researchers, designers, engineers, and creative professionals across
industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, architecture, and media and entertainment.
Automotive
NVIDIA’s Automotive market is comprised of cockpit infotainment solutions, AV platforms, and associated development
agreements. Leveraging our technology leadership in AI and building on our long-standing automotive relationships, we
are delivering a complete end-to-end solution for the AV market under the DRIVE brand. NVIDIA has demonstrated
multiple applications of AI within the car: AI can drive the car itself as a pilot in fully autonomous mode or it can also be a
co-pilot, assisting the human driver while creating a safer driving experience.
NVIDIA is working with several hundred partners in the automotive ecosystem including automakers, truck makers, tier-
one suppliers, sensor manufacturers, automotive research institutions, HD mapping companies, and startups to develop
and deploy AI systems for self-driving vehicles. Our unified AI computing architecture starts with training deep neural
networks using our GPUs, and then running a full perception, planning and control stack within the vehicle on the NVIDIA
DRIVE computing platform. The in-vehicle platform consists of the high-performance, energy efficient DRIVE AGX
computing hardware, and open, modular software, including DRIVE AV for autonomous driving and DRIVE IX for in-
vehicle intelligent experience and AI assistants.
NVIDIA DRIVE can perceive and understand in real-time what is happening around the vehicle, precisely locate itself on
an HD map, and plan a safe path forward. This advanced self-driving car platform combines deep learning, sensor
fusion, and surround vision to change the driving experience. Our DRIVE platform scales from a palm-sized, energy-
efficient module for automated highway-driving capabilities to a configuration with multiple systems aimed at enabling
driverless cars. Our Xavier system-on-a-chip, or SoC, which started shipping in 2018, enables vehicles to use deep
neural networks to process data from multiple cameras and sensors. It powers the DRIVE AutoPilot, NVIDIA’s Level 2+
automated driving solution, combining the DRIVE AV self-driving solution with the DRIVE IX cockpit software, including a
visualization system for allowing the driver to see what the car sees and plans to do. In fiscal year 2020, we announced
our next-generation SoC, Orin.
In addition, we offer a scalable data center-based simulation solution, NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation running DRIVE Sim
software, for testing and validating a self-driving platform before commercial deployment. NVIDIA's unique end-to-end,
software-defined approach is designed for continuous innovation and continuous development, enabling cars to receive
over-the-air updates to add new features and capabilities throughout the life of a vehicle.

Business Strategies
NVIDIA’s key strategies that shape our overall business approach include:
Advancing the NVIDIA accelerated computing platform. NVIDIA’s accelerated computing platform can solve complex
problems in significantly less time and with lower power consumption than alternative computational approaches.
Indeed, it can help solve problems that were previously deemed unsolvable. We work to deliver continued performance
leaps that outpace Moore’s Law by leveraging innovation across the architecture, chip design, system, and software
layers. With our acquisition of Mellanox in fiscal year 2021, we strengthened our end-to-end expertise in data center
architectures, positioning us for a future when the data center is the new unit of computing. This full-stack innovation
approach allows us to deliver order-of-magnitude performance advantages relative to legacy approaches in our target
markets, which include Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. While the requirements of
these end markets are diverse, we address them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and CUDA
as the fundamental building blocks. The programmable nature of our architecture allows us to make leveraged
investments in R&D: we can support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same underlying technology by
using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third party developers and partners. We utilize this
platform approach in each of our target markets.
Extending our technology and platform leadership in AI. We provide a complete, end-to-end accelerated computing
platform for deep learning and machine learning, addressing both training and inferencing. This includes GPUs,
interconnects, systems, our CUDA programming language, algorithms, libraries, and other software. GPUs are uniquely
suited to AI, and we will continue to add AI-specific features to our GPU architecture to further extend our leadership
position. Our AI technology leadership is reinforced by our large and expanding ecosystem in a virtuous cycle. Our GPU
platforms are available from virtually every major server maker and cloud service provider, as well as on our own AI
supercomputer. There are over 2.2 million developers worldwide using CUDA and our other software tools to help
deploy our technology in our target markets. We evangelize AI through partnerships with hundreds of universities and
more than 7,000 startups through our Inception program. Additionally, our Deep Learning Institute provides instruction
on the latest techniques on how to design, train, and deploy neural networks in applications using our accelerated
computing platform.
Extending our technology and platform leadership in visual computing. We believe that visual computing is
fundamental to the continued expansion and evolution of computing. We apply our research and development resources
to extending our leadership in visual computing, enabling us to enhance the user experience for consumer
entertainment and professional visualization applications. Our technologies are instrumental in driving gaming forward,
as developers leverage our libraries and algorithms to create near-cinematic and VR experiences. Our close
collaboration with game developers allows us to deliver an optimized gaming experience on our GeForce platform. Our
GeForce Experience gaming application further enhances each gamer’s experience by optimizing their PC’s settings, as
well as enabling the recording and sharing of gameplay. We also enable interactive graphics applications - such as
games, movie and photo editing and design software - to be accessed by almost any device, almost anywhere, through
our cloud platforms such as GRID for enterprise and GeForce NOW for gaming.
Advancing the leading autonomous vehicle platform. We believe the advent of AV will soon revolutionize the
transportation industry. In our view, AI is the key technology enabler of this opportunity, as the algorithms required for
autonomous driving - such as perception, localization, and planning - are too complex for legacy hand-coded
approaches and will run on multiple trained neural networks instead. Therefore, we provide a full functionally safe AI-
based hardware and software solution for the AV market under the DRIVE brand, which we are bringing to market
through our partnerships with automotive original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, tier-1 suppliers, and start-ups.
Our AV solution also includes the GPU-based hardware required to train the neural networks before their in-vehicle
deployment, as well as to re-simulate their operation prior to any over-the-air software updates. We believe our
comprehensive, top-to-bottom and end-to-end approach will enable the transportation industry to solve the complex
problems arising from the shift to autonomous driving.
Leveraging our intellectual property. We believe our intellectual property is a valuable asset that can be accessed by
our customers and partners through license and development agreements when they desire to build such capabilities
directly into their own products, or have us do so through a custom development. Such license and development
arrangements can further enhance the reach of our technology.
Sales and Marketing
Our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets with our high-
performance and efficient computing platforms. Our sales and marketing teams, located across our global markets,
work closely with end customers and various industry ecosystems through our partner network. Our partner network
8

--- Page 98 ---

incorporates each industry's respective OEMs, original device manufacturers, or ODMs, system builders, add-in board
manufacturers, or AIBs, retailers/distributors, internet and cloud service providers, automotive manufacturers and
tier-1 automotive suppliers, mapping companies, start-ups, and other ecosystem participants.
Members of our sales team have technical expertise and product and industry knowledge. We also employ a team of
application engineers to assist our partner network in designing, testing, and qualifying system designs that incorporate
our platforms. We believe that the depth and quality of our design support are key to improving our partner network’s
time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction, and fostering relationships that encourage our end
customers and partner network to use the next generation of our products within each platform.
To encourage the development of applications optimized for our platforms, we seek to establish and maintain strong
relationships in the software development community. Engineering and marketing personnel engage with key software
developers to promote and discuss our platforms, as well as to ascertain individual product requirements and solve
technical problems. Our developer program makes our products available to developers prior to launch in order to
encourage the development of AI frameworks, SDKs, and APIs for software applications and game titles that are
optimized for our platforms. Our Deep Learning Institute provides in-person and online training for developers in
industries and organizations around the world to build AI and accelerated computing applications that leverage our
platforms.
As NVIDIA’s business has evolved from a focus primarily on gaming products to broader markets, and from chips to
platforms and complete systems, so, too, have our avenues to market. Thus, in addition to sales to customers in our
partner network, certain of our platforms are also sold through e-tail channels, or direct to cloud service providers and
enterprise customers.
Seasonality
Our computing platforms serve a diverse set of markets such as enterprise and cloud data centers, consumer gaming,
professional workstations, and automotive. Our consumer products typically see stronger revenue in the second half of
our fiscal year. In addition, based on the production schedules of key customers, some of our products for notebooks
and game consoles typically generate stronger revenue in the second and third quarters, and weaker revenue in the
fourth and first quarters. However, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue.
Manufacturing
We do not directly manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing
strategy, whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer
fabrication, assembly, testing, and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are
certified by the International Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and
assurance, reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with
owning and operating manufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the
production of our products, such as substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for
procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus our
resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing, and customer support.
We utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and Samsung
Electronics Co. Ltd, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as Amkor
Technology, BYD Auto Co. Ltd., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd., Omni Logistics, LLC and
Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd. to perform assembly, testing, and packaging of most of our products and
platforms. We use contract manufacturers such as Flex Ltd. to manufacture our standard and custom adapter card
products and switch systems, and Fabrinet to manufacture our cables. We purchase substrates from Ibiden Co. Ltd.,
Kinsus Interconnect Technology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation, and memory from Micron
Technology, Samsung Semiconductor, Inc., and SK Hynix.
We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance and
configuration, and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, distributors,
motherboard and add-in card, or AIC, customers from our third-party warehouse in Hong Kong, Israel, and the United
States. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications,
and then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMs as motherboard and AIC solutions.
We also utilize industry-leading contract manufacturers, or CMs, such as Flex Ltd. and Fabrinet, and ODMs such as
Wistron Corporation, to manufacture some of our products for sale directly to end customers. In those cases, key
9

--- Page 99 ---

elements such as the GPU, SoC, memory, and integrated circuit are often consigned by us to the CMs, who are
responsible for the procurement of other components used in the production process.
Competition
The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving
industry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of product
offerings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry
standard APIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to
remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and
partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of
quality and at competitive prices. We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market
entrants with products that may be lower priced than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not
provided by our products. In addition, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge
and acquire significant market share.
A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, including Intel’s
recent announcement that they will introduce high performance GPUs, embedded SOCs, and other accelerated, AI
computing processor products, and providers of semiconductor-based high-performance interconnect products based
on InfiniBand, Ethernet, Fibre Channel and proprietary technologies. Some of our competitors may have greater
marketing, financial, distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer
or technological changes. We expect an increasingly competitive environment in our fiscal year 2022.
Our current competitors include:
• suppliers and licensors designing discrete and integrated GPUs and other accelerated computing solutions,
including chipsets that incorporate 3D graphics, or HPC, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, Intel
Corporation, and Xilinx, Inc.;
• large internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporates HPC or accelerated
computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alphabet Inc. and Amazon, Inc.;
• suppliers of SoC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices,
such as Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Inc., Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation,
Samsung, and Xilinx or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for internal use, such as Tesla
Motors; and
• suppliers of interconnect, switch and cable solutions such as Applied Optoelectronics, Inc., Arista Networks,
Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Intel, Juniper Networks, Inc., Lumentum
Holdings, Marvell Technology Group, and Xilinx, as well as internal teams of system vendors and large internet
services companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
We rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure
agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. Our
currently issued patents have expiration dates from March 2021 to June 2045. We have numerous patents issued,
allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications
primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international
treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign countries in
which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our
products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection
makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where
to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:
• the location in which our products are manufactured;
• our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;
• the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and
• the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and
regions.
10

--- Page 100 ---

We have also licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.
Government Regulations
Our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of
foreign governments. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had a material effect upon our capital
expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position, and we do not currently anticipate material capital
expenditures for environmental control facilities. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental
regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data
protection, employee health and safety, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods.
Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts.
Human Capital Management
We believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our
stakeholders. As of January 31, 2021, we had 18,975 employees in 29 countries. 13,532 were engaged in research and
development and 5,443 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions.
To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain talented
employees, including qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff, and research and development
personnel. The primary ways in which we seek to do this are summarized below, in addition to an overview of employee
programs we implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Recruitment
The demand for talent in new markets, such as AI and deep learning, is increasingly competitive. Our intern and new
college graduate recruiting programs are a sustainable source of talent. We partner with higher education institutions
globally to develop our candidate pipelines, recruit at industry conferences, and encourage our employees to submit
referrals, with over 36% of hires coming from internal recommendations. Collaborations with our community resource
groups improve how we reach and attract minority candidates.
Development and Retention
To support employee advancement, we provide training on-the-job through coaching, feedback, and role modeling. We
have a rich library of live and on-demand learning experiences such as workshops, panel discussions, speaker-based
forums, and internally focused technical conferences. We curate learning libraries around our most common
development needs, provide the latest technical platforms to support self-paced learning, and regularly listen to learner
feedback through internal messaging channels to improve and update those topics. We offer tuition reimbursement
programs and subsidize advanced technical education programs and online technical certifications. We encourage
internal mobility through career expos and coaching, as well as foster mentorship connections and provide trained
coaches as additional developmental support. Our strong partnerships with internal community resource groups allow
us to personalize programs to address specific career development needs.
To evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use several listening mechanisms such as pulse surveys, a
suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party hotline.
In fiscal year 2021, our overall turnover rate was 3.8%.
Compensation, Benefits, and Well-Being
Our compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the company’s
future. Employees receive equity (except where unavailable due to local regulations) that is tied to the value of our stock
price and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of our
stockholders.
We offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ well-being, including 401(k) programs in
the U.S., statutory pension programs outside the U.S., our employee stock purchase program, flexible work hours and
time off, and programs to address mental health, stress, and time-management challenges. We evaluate our benefit
offerings globally and are committed to providing tailored benefits based on community needs, including assistance for
military members, additional mental health benefits, and support for new birth parents, and those who wish to become
parents.

Diversity and Inclusion
We believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all
employees, regardless of gender, gender identity or expression, veteran status, race, ethnicity, or ability.
We have increased our efforts to recruit, develop, and retain a more diverse workforce with a focus on those historically
underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black, and Hispanic candidates. In fiscal year 2021, we
created the role of Head of Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging, along with hiring a global diversity recruiting leader, and
a Head of Strategic Initiatives to build our developer ecosystem and ensure it represents the global population.
Efforts we are undertaking include:
• Shepherding underrepresented candidates through the interviewing process, engaging employees from
underrepresented communities for recruiting events and interview panels, and increased investment in
minority-serving institutions and professional organizations.
• Developing an internal slate of diverse talent for all open management positions, beginning semi-annual talent
review sessions with executives to identify internal, diverse talent, and forming sponsorship and career
acceleration programs.
• Increasing inclusion communications and pulse surveys to measure employee sentiment.
As of January 31, 2021, our global workforce was 80% male and 20% female, and 6% of our workforce in the United
States was composed of Black or African American, and Hispanic or Latino employees.
Safety and COVID-19
We support our people and their families in making their health a top priority. We implemented global protocols to slow
the spread of COVID-19 and to keep our workforce safe by closing our offices around the world in March 2020 for all
except essential workers. We also eliminated most business travel. We provided our employees with resources to work
remotely and continued to pay all employees and contractors. For essential labs and offices that remain open, we
instituted appropriate safety protocols and social distancing guidelines. Additionally, we provided resources for
employees, including work from home support, enhanced health coverage, reimbursement for certain work from home
expenses, and learning and development resources on how to lead and manage remotely.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
In evaluating NVIDIA and our business, the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K. Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves
risks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. Any one of the following risks could harm our business, financial
condition, results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline, and you may lose all or a part of
your investment. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are
immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.
Risks Related to Our Industry and Markets
If we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or to identify new products, services or technologies, our
revenue and financial results may be adversely impacted.
Our GPU-based visual and accelerated computing platforms address four large markets: Gaming, Professional
Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive. These markets often experience rapid technological change, changes in
customer requirements, new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards. Our success
depends on our ability to identify emerging industry changes and to develop new (or enhance our existing) products,
services and technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets. Such activities may require considerable
technical, financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments. We devote significant resources to the development
of technologies and business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history, such as the automotive
and data center markets, which presents additional risks to our business. For example, we must continue to accurately
forecast demand, scale and optimize utilization in our data center business, and develop and deliver next-generation
autonomous driving solutions to our partners and customers or our business could be negatively impacted. We also
must continue to scale our networking business following the Mellanox acquisition by leveraging our joint product
13

--- Page 103 ---

capabilities and continuing to effectively integrate company processes. We must also continue to develop the
infrastructure needed to scale our business in these areas, including customer service and support, e-commerce and
intellectual property, or IP, licensing capabilities. If we do not continue to evolve our business, including by developing
market specific technologies, managing the social and environmental impact of our products and technologies,
expanding the ecosystem for our current and future products and technologies, and monetizing and expanding our
business in various areas, our financial results could be negatively impacted. We also must meet customer safety and
compliance standards, which are subject to change, including those applicable to our automotive solutions and systems.
Additionally, we continue to make considerable investments in research and development, which may not produce
significant revenue for several years, if at all. If our investments are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new products,
services and technologies, or if we focus on technologies that do not become widely adopted, our business, revenue,
financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that our strategic
direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers, partners, and
ultimately, our shareholders. If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology
trends, or if we do not appropriately adapt our strategies as market conditions evolve, in a timely manner to exploit
potential market opportunities, our business will be harmed.
For our products that we do not sell directly to consumers, achieving design wins is an important success factor,
including for our interconnect products. Achieving design wins may involve a lengthy process in pursuit of a customer
opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate features and functionality that customers and consumers will
demand. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations
of a particular product. This could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid
selection processes.
Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major
hardware manufacturers and software developers. Additionally, if our products are not in compliance with prevailing
industry standards, including safety standards, our customers may not incorporate our products into their design
strategies. Furthermore, winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as
much revenue as anticipated, if any.
Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue.
Our target markets remain extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand
their product and/or service offerings, industry standards continue to evolve, customer needs change and new
competitors enter these markets. Our competitors’ products, services and technologies may be less costly, or may offer
superior functionality or better features, than ours, which may result, among other things, in lower than expected selling
prices for our products. In addition, some of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities, have
longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive IP portfolios and patent protections, and greater
financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to more effectively
identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, quickly transition their
products, including semiconductor products, to increasingly smaller line width geometries, and obtain sufficient foundry
capacity and packaging materials, which could harm our business. In our networking business, some of our customers
are also integrated circuit and switch suppliers and already have in-house expertise and internal development
capabilities similar to ours. Licensing our technology and supporting such customers entails the transfer of intellectual
property rights that may enable such customers to develop their own products and solutions to replace those we are
currently providing to them. Consequently, these customers may become competitors to us. Further, each new design by
a customer presents a competitive situation. If we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets, respond to
changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment, including
in significant international markets such as China, demand for our products, services and technologies could decrease,
which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our results of operations to suffer. In addition, the competitive
landscape in our target markets has changed and may continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation, which
could lead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.
Risks Related to Our Supply and Manufacturing
We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and/or package our products, which
reduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and product
delivery schedule and could harm our business.
We do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility.
Instead, we are dependent on industry-leading foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company
Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment
14

--- Page 104 ---

and techniques. Similarly, we do not directly assemble, test or package our products, but instead rely on independent
subcontractors. In the past we have not had and going forward we may not have long-term commitment contracts with
these foundries or subcontractors. Nevertheless, we may enter into long-term procurement and capacity commitments
as our business grows or in periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain. As our
business grows, we must continue to scale and adapt our supply chain or it could have an adverse impact on our
business. As a result, we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet
customer demand, scale our supply chain and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue
and/or financial results, including:
• a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices,
which could be impacted by our failure to correctly estimate demand and to place orders with our suppliers in
sufficient quantities and/or in a timely manner;
• a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate, or any, manufacturing or
test capacity for our products;
• a failure by our foundries to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality, leading-edge process
technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node
technologies and memory designs needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis;
• a limited number of suppliers, including foundries, assembly and test providers, and memory manufacturers;
• loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or
subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or
change a supplier;
• a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality; and
• delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event our
subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ orders over our orders or otherwise.
In addition, low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand, increase
manufacturing costs, harm customer or partner relationships, and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross
margin, revenue and/or financial results. Manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design, which
is developed largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to the foundry. Low yields may result
from either product design or process technology failure. We do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our
design is actually manufactured by the foundry. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the
manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem.
We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new
products or product enhancements, and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner. In
the past, we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of
then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products. The
design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our
products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools. If we miss design cycles or lose design
wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools, we could lose market share and our revenues could
decline. If we fail to achieve design wins for our products, our business will be harmed.
If our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our
reputation could be damaged, and we could lose market share.
Our products, including both hardware and software offerings, are complex and may contain defects or security
vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication,
packaging, materials and/or use within a system. These risks may increase as our products are introduced into new
devices, markets, technologies and applications, including into the automotive market, or as new versions are released.
Some errors in our products or services may only be discovered after a product or service has been shipped or used by
customers or the end users of such product. Undiscovered vulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our
customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses, worms and
other malicious software programs that could attack our products or services. Failure of our products to perform to
specifications, or other product defects, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers,
the end product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to
the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair or
15

--- Page 105 ---

replacement costs, write-off the value of related inventory, cause us to lose market share, and divert the attention of our
engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue. In addition, an error or defect
in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in
failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins, harm our relationships with customers and partners and
harm consumers’ perceptions of our brand. Also, we may be required to reimburse our customers, partners or
consumers, including costs to repair or replace products in the field. A product recall, including automotive recalls or
recalls due to a bug in our products, or a significant number of product returns could be expensive, damage our
reputation, harm our ability to attract new customers, result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in
litigation against us, such as product liability suits. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending
the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our
business. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on
acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results.
Risks Related to Our Operating Business
If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed.
Our products are manufactured based on estimates of customers’ future demand and our manufacturing lead times are
very long. This could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or
excess inventory, and make our demand forecast more uncertain. We sell many of our products through a channel
model, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made
by our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand
for our products could impact our financial results. In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery
schedules for our customers, we may build inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, may build
inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pent-up
demand. In periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, we may place non-
cancellable inventory orders significantly in advance of our normal lead times, pay premiums or provide deposits to
secure normal and incremental future supply, which could negatively impact our financial results. Demand for our
products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, competitor announcements, and
competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue. For example, our GPUs for
gaming are capable of digital currency mining. Demand and use of GPUs for cryptocurrency has fluctuated in the past
and is likely to continue to change quickly. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including changes in the prices of
cryptocurrencies, can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to
cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may also
create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. Additionally, consumer
behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our Gaming, Data Center and mobile workstation
and laptop products and suppressed corporate demand for desktop workstations, has made it more difficult for us to
estimate future demand, and these challenges may be more pronounced in the future if and when the effects of the
pandemic subside. In estimating demand, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect. If we
are unable to accurately anticipate demand for our products, our business and financial results could be adversely
impacted. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include:
• changes in business and economic conditions, including downturns in our target markets and/or overall
economy;
• changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit
market;
• a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products;
• a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer
requirements;
• our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products;
• less demand than expected for newly-introduced products; or
• increased competition, including competitive pricing actions.
The cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could
adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last
month of each quarter, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in
16

--- Page 106 ---

response to customer cancellations or deferrals. We could be required to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost
or net realizable value or excess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we
incorrectly forecast product demand, any of which could harm our financial results.
Conversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequate
lead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers'
orders on a timely basis. We may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. In such
cases, even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a
cost-effective or timely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer
relationships could be damaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged.
System security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our
expected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our
reputation.
Security breaches, computer malware, phishing, and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in
recent years. These threats are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them
or implement adequate preventative measures. These attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are
expected to occur in the future. Experienced computer programmers, hackers and employees may penetrate our
security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information, or that of our employees or third
parties. These attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These hackers may also develop and deploy
viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our
products, including consumer and automotive products, where we utilize over-the-air updates to improve functionality
over time. For portions of our IT infrastructure, including business management and communication software products,
we rely on products and services provided by third parties. These providers may also experience breaches and attacks
to their products which may impact our systems. For example, in 2020, SolarWinds Inc., one of our third party software
service providers, was subject to a data security breach. To date, our investigations of this breach, which were
supported by a third party expert, have not identified any adverse impact to NVIDIA. Data security breaches may also
result from non-technical means, such as actions by an employee with access to our systems. To defend against
security threats, both to our internal systems and those of our customers, we must continuously engineer more secure
products and enhance security and reliability features, which may result in increased expenses. We must also continue
to develop security measures within NVIDIA, ensure our suppliers have appropriate security measures in place, and
continue to meet the evolving security requirements of our customers or our business could be negatively impacted.
Actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved
dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our partners, our customers or third
parties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and
potential liability, paying damages, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to
our business. Our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be
successful. We may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers.
Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions. Delayed sales,
lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price
and reputation.
Business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs.
Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages,
outages at cloud service providers, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, cyber-
attacks, terrorist attacks, medical epidemics or pandemics (including, but not limited to, COVID-19) and other natural or
man-made disasters, catastrophic events or climate change. The occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our
business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses. Any of these
business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. Such
risks are discussed further in the risk factor “The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could
materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.” Our corporate headquarters, and a portion
of our research and development activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations, finished
goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity.
In addition, a large portion of our current data center capacity is located in California, making our operations vulnerable
to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. The manufacture of product
components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic
locations, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Israel and Korea. Additionally, a significant portion of our finished goods
product distribution occurs through Hong Kong, Israel and Taiwan. Geopolitical change or changes in government
17

--- Page 107 ---

regulations and policies in the United States or abroad may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade policies,
import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global
markets, hiring, and profitability. In particular, revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement
could result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on
imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans or impact the
timing of our shipments. For example, regulations to implement the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 could have an
adverse effect on our business plans. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide
us critical infrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. In addition, geopolitical
and domestic political developments, such as existing and potential trade wars, political or social unrest, elections and
post-election developments, and other events beyond our control, can increase levels of political and economic
unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets. Political instability, changes in
government or adverse political developments in or around any of the major countries in which we do business would
also likely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations could be harmed if
manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters,
high heat events or water shortages, other negative impacts from climate change, information technology system
failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The
ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near
major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown. In the event a major
earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our business
could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses, substantial expenditures and time spent to
fully resume operations. All of these risks and conditions could materially adversely affect our future sales and
operating results.
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations.
COVID-19 has spread worldwide, resulting in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to
contain the disease, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. These
measures have impacted, and may further impact, our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers and
our partners, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers (including our subcontractors and third-party contract
manufacturers). Our critical business operations, including our headquarters, most of our finished goods inventory and
many of our key suppliers are located in regions which have been impacted by COVID-19. Our customers and suppliers
worldwide have also been affected and may continue to be affected by COVID-19 related restrictions and closures.
The COVID-19 pandemic has increased economic and demand uncertainty. It continues to affect our business in both
positive and negative ways, and there is uncertainty around their duration and impact. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2021, our Gaming and Data Center market platforms benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn,
and play from home. Our Professional Visualization market platform benefited from work-from-home trends in mobile
workstations and desktop workstation demand has started to recover, although not back to pre-COVID levels. In our
Automotive market platform, COVID-19 did not have a significant impact on demand in the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2021. In some regions, markets, or industries, where COVID-19 has driven an increase in sales for our products, the
demand may not be sustainable if conditions change. Additionally, stronger demand globally has limited the availability
of capacity and components in our supply chain, particularly in Gaming, which could cause us to order an excess amount
if demand changes, pay higher prices, or limit our ability to obtain supply at necessary levels or at all. As the COVID-19
pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers and the availability of supply chain, logistical
services and component supply may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial results.
The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are
concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, Israel and Korea. A significant portion
of our finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong, Israel and Taiwan. Additionally, our headquarters
is located in California. Each of these countries and locations has been affected by the pandemic and has taken
measures to try to contain it, including restrictions on manufacturing facilities, commerce, travel, on our support
operations or workforce, or on our customers, partners, vendors and suppliers. There is considerable uncertainty
regarding the impact of such measures and potential future measures. Such measures, as well as restrictions or
disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability or increased cost of air transport, port closures and increased
border controls or closures, could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition and results of operations.
The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, mandatory work-
from-home policies and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take
18

--- Page 108 ---

further actions as required by government authorities and regulations or that we determine are in the best interests of
our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. Most of our employees continue to work remotely. There is no
certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to perform
critical functions could be harmed.
While the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business is difficult to assess or
predict, the pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets,
which may reduce our ability to access capital or our customers’ ability to pay us for past or future purchases, which
could negatively affect our liquidity. A recession or financial market correction resulting from the lack of containment
and spread of COVID-19 could impact overall technology spending, adversely affecting demand for our products, our
business and the value of our common stock.
The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change.
The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to
execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments,
including, but not limited to, the duration and continued spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain the
disease or treat its impact, availability of vaccines or other treatments, further related restrictions on travel, and the
duration, timing and severity of the impact on customer spending, including any recession resulting from the pandemic,
all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations,
access to sources of liquidity and financial condition, though the full extent and duration is uncertain.
We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or investments,
including the Mellanox acquisition and the planned Arm acquisition, and we may not be able to successfully integrate
acquisition targets, which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.
We have in the past acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, other businesses that offer
products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products, strategic
objectives and business. We completed our acquisition of Mellanox for approximately $7 billion in April 2020. In
September 2020, we announced our agreement to acquire all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a
transaction valued at $40 billion. The Mellanox acquisition, the planned Arm acquisition and future acquisitions or
investments involve significant challenges and risks, and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new
products or sell our products, and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results. Given
that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a
particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve
our strategic objectives. Furthermore, if we are unable to complete acquisitions in a timely manner, including due to
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain
critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve, making the acquisition less attractive, and other changes
can take place which could jeopardize or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our
business. In addition, we have made and may in the future make strategic investments in private companies and may
not realize a return on our investments. Additional risks related to the Mellanox acquisition, the planned Arm acquisition
and other acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:
• difficulty in combining the technology, products, or operations of the acquired business with our business;
• difficulty in integrating and retaining the acquired workforce, including key employees;
• diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;
• assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs
of acquired assets;
• integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;
• coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated;
• acquiring business challenges and risks, including, but not limited to, disputes with management and
integrating international operations and joint ventures;
• difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return, if any return at all;
19

--- Page 109 ---

• difficulty in obtaining or inability to obtain governmental and regulatory consents and approvals, other
approvals or financing;
• the potential impact of with complying with governmental or other regulatory restrictions placed on an
acquisition;
• the potential impact on our stock price and financial results if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an
acquisition, are required to pay reverse breakup fees or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;
• failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic
investment;
• legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;
• the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities;
• the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;
• uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;
• negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target
operate;
• the need to determine an alternative strategy if an acquisition does not meet our expectations;
• potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or
company; and
• impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s employees, vendors and customers, as a result of
our acquisition or investment.
We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network and
our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.
We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partner
network. With several of these distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms through their
channels. Our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales within our partner network, as
well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our processors. In the future, these partners may
decide to purchase fewer products than they did in the past, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to
alter their purchasing patterns in some other way, particularly because:
• most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, which permits our customers to cancel, change or delay
product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty;
• our partners may develop their own solutions;
• our customers may purchase products from our competitors; or
• our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products.
We could also be restricted from selling our products or providing our technology and services due to U.S. trade
restrictions. The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, or our inability to sell
to a customer due to U.S. trade restrictions would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations, and any
difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition.
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our
customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these
customers. In the future, we may have to record additional provisions or write-offs and/or defer revenue on certain
sales transactions, which could negatively impact our financial results, and we may not be able to acquire credit
insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient.
20

We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, including adverse economic
conditions, which may harm our business.
We conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the United States. Our
semiconductor wafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United
States. We also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the United States. We allocate revenue
to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if our customers’ revenue is
attributable to end customers that are located in a different location. Revenue from sales outside of the United States
accounted for 81% of total revenue for fiscal year 2021, 92% for fiscal year 2020 and 87% for fiscal year 2019. Revenue
from billings to China, including Hong Kong, was 23% of our revenue for fiscal year 2021. Additionally, as of January 31,
2021, approximately 53% of our employees were located outside of the United States. The global nature of our business
subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations, including:
• international economic and political conditions and other political tensions between countries in which we do
business;
• unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws
and employee safety and health regulations and those applicable to business acquisitions;
• differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices;
• local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business
practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption
laws and regulations;
• exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions, including deemed export restrictions,
tariffs, quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions;
• disruptions of capital and trading markets and currency fluctuations;
• increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations, such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and
pollution limits; and
• natural disasters, public health issues (including the COVID-19 pandemic discussed further in the risk factor
“The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations,” above), and other catastrophic events.
If our sales outside of the United States are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may
be negatively impacted.
We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide that differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas
including, but not limited to: IP ownership and infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption;
foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; data privacy requirements; competition; advertising;
employment; product regulations; environment, health, and safety requirements; and consumer laws. Compliance with
such requirements can be onerous and expensive, and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively.
Expanding privacy legislation and compliance costs of privacy-related and data protection measures could adversely
affect our customers and their products and services, which could in turn reduce demand for our products used for
those workloads.
Although we have policies, controls, and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws, there can
be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, or agents will not violate such laws or our policies.
Violations of these laws and regulations can result in fines; criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees;
prohibitions on the conduct of our business; and damage to our reputation. The technology industry is subject to intense
media, political, and regulatory scrutiny, which can increase our exposure to government investigations, legal actions,
and penalties.
Adverse changes in global, regional or local economic conditions, including recession or slowing growth, changes or
uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or trade policy, higher interest rates, tighter credit, inflation, lower capital expenditures
by businesses including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence and spending,
periodically occur. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. It is likely that
the continued spread of COVID-19 will cause an economic slowdown, and it is possible that it could cause a global
21

--- Page 111 ---

recession. Adverse changes in economic conditions, including as a result of the pandemic, can significantly harm
demand for our products and make it more challenging to forecast our operating results and make business decisions,
including regarding prioritization of investments in our business. A slowdown in economic growth could have adverse,
wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including a decrease in demand for our products and
technologies; a decrease in demand for the products and services of our customers or licensees; the inability of our
suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us, our inability to supply our products to our customers and/or the
inability of our customers or licensees to supply their products to end users; the insolvency of key suppliers, customers
or licensees; delays in reporting or payments from our customers or licensees; failures by counterparties; and/or
negative effects on inventories. Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may
also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for
bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales, additional inventory or bad
debt expense. Economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers, which could impair their ability to
deliver parts and negatively affect our ability to manage operations and deliver our products. These conditions may also
lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect our
ability to compete effectively. An economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and
collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts
on our suppliers, failures of counterparties including financial institutions and insurers, asset impairments, and declines
in the value of our financial instruments.
Additionally, we have engineering facilities, corporate and sales support operations and some of our manufacturing
located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel and the Middle East may directly affect
our business. In addition, the State of Israel and companies with business in Israel have in the past been the subject of
an economic boycott and could be in the future. Other countries have in the past, and may continue in the future, to
restrict business with the State of Israel and companies with Israeli operations. Further, we are unable to ship products
manufactured in Israel to certain countries. These laws and policies may have an impact on our results of operations.
Any losses or damages incurred by us as a result of such events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.
If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, we may not be able to execute our
business strategy effectively.
To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives
and key employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. In
particular, hiring qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff and research and development personnel is
critical to our business. We also must recruit and develop diverse talent. Additionally, changes in immigration and work
permit laws and regulations or the administration or interpretation of such laws or regulations could impair our ability
to attract and retain highly qualified employees. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain
key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected.
Additionally, competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cash and stock-based compensation.
The interpretation and application of employment related laws to our workforce practices may result in increased
operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. We also must retain the key personnel hired as
a result of our acquisitions, or it could reduce the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and negatively impact our
business. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer
of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. We
continue to evolve our business practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by supporting and providing resources
to our employees who are working remotely and implementing stringent safety guidelines for those who go into the
essential labs and offices that remain open. If we do not continue to anticipate and address the safety and wellness
needs of our employees sufficiently and/or in a timely manner, their productivity could be impacted, or we could fail to
retain them.
Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are
below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.
Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors.
Therefore, investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future
performance.
Additional factors, other than or in addition to those described elsewhere in these risk factors, that could affect our
results of operations in the future include, but are not limited to:
• our ability to achieve volume production of our next-generation products;
22

--- Page 112 ---

• our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of
our products and services;
• fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies and COVID-19, as discussed further in
the risk factor “If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed;”
• changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our partners’ products;
• our ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive pricing;
• our ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations;
• product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues;
• our ability to secure appropriate safety certifications and meet industry safety standards;
• supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our products;
• inventory write-downs;
• our ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network, including by generating sales within our
partner network and ensuring our products are incorporated into our partners product ecosystems, and our
partner network’s ability to sell products that incorporate our technologies;
• our dependence on third party vendors and end users to adopt our products, including InfiniBand;
• the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments to us, and our ability to obtain credit
insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers;
• customer bad debt write-offs;
• any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities;
• unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property;
• our ability to maintain and scale our business processes, information systems and internal controls;
• changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards; and
• general macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target markets.
Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results.
Any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock
price to decline or experience substantial price volatility.
Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Common Stock and Other Matters
Actions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be
harmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.
We have in the past, currently are, and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging
patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed
to indemnify for certain claims of infringement. An unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation
could include significant damages, invalidation of a patent or family of patents, indemnification of customers, payment of
lost profits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of
others, regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims,
and they may also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.
We may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights. Such
proceedings may increase our operating expenses, which could negatively impact our operating results. Further, we
could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation. If infringement claims are made against us or
our products are found to infringe a third party’s patent or intellectual property, we or one of our indemnitees may have
to seek a license to the third party’s patent or other intellectual property rights. However, we may not be able to obtain
licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable
23

--- Page 113 ---

to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products, we could be
subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our
products. We may also have to make royalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. If these arrangements
are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the
indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact
our operating results.
Our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely primarily on a
combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing
arrangements, and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the United States
and internationally. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property
rights, and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights that are
valuable to our business. The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property
rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and
products more likely. In addition, the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential
business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value
of our investment in research and development, product development, and marketing could be reduced. We also may
face risks to our intellectual property if our employees are hired by potential competitors. We continuously assess
whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies, but cannot be certain
whether our applications for such protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able to enforce such
protections.
Privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential
users from using our products and services, result in liability, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings.
Our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is
subject to privacy and security laws and regulations. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products
and services with regard to the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-
related matters, including for use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our
operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our
business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increased security costs, damage to our reputation,
regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased costs related to defending legal claims.
Worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data
protection, which continue to evolve and apply to our business. For example, the European Union adopted the General
Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which required companies to meet requirements effective as of May 2018
regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to
access, correct and delete such data about themselves. Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of
up to 4% of worldwide revenue. In addition, California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA,
which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of
certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared.
Violations of the CCPA carry substantial civil penalties and the law creates a private right of action for certain data
breaches, which is expected to increase data breach litigation. California’s privacy laws will expand substantially
effective January 1, 2023 as a result of California voters approving the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, in
the November 2020 election. The CPRA will, among other things, restrict use of certain categories of sensitive personal
information; further restrict the use of cross-contextual advertising techniques; establish restrictions on the retention of
personal information; expand the types of data breaches subject to the private right of action; and establish the
California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law, as well as impose administrative fines.
Since the enactment of the CCPA, more than half of the states in the United States and the United States Congress have
considered proposed privacy legislation, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States.
The interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are
often uncertain and fluid, and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If
so, we may be ordered to change our data practices and/or be fined. Complying with these changing laws has caused,
and could continue to cause, us to incur substantial costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business and
results of operations. Further, failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to
stop the alleged noncompliant activity.
24

We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher
than expected tax rates.
As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll,
sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreign
jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in
different jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and
other tax liabilities. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. For example, we are
currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for our fiscal years 2018 and 2019 and under audit in the
United Kingdom, Germany, Israel and India. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may
disagree with certain positions we have taken, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our
worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial
position, results of operations, and cash flows. Further, changes in United States federal, and state or international tax
laws applicable to multinational corporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense
and cash flows, as we experienced in fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the TCJA.
Our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, changes in our business or
statutory rates, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in available
tax credits, the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, changes in United States generally accepted accounting
principles, adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax
purposes, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances,
changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and the
recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur,
the impact of accounting for business combinations, shifts in the amount of earnings in the United States compared with
other regions in the world and overall levels of income before tax, changes in the domestic or international organization
of our business and structure, as well as the expiration of statute of limitations and settlements of audits. Any changes
in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.
Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.
We currently and may in the future face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or
investigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business on a global
basis. For example, we are currently defending ourselves in a shareholder lawsuit claiming that we and certain of our
officers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining
on GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. In addition, multiple stockholders, purporting to act on our behalf, filed derivative
lawsuits seeking to assert claims on our behalf against the members of our board of directors and certain officers based
on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of
cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand.
Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetary
damages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain business
practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlement
may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. In
addition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.
In addition, the laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex and change frequently. We may be required
to incur significant expense to comply with changes in, or remedy violations of, these laws and regulations.
Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft
Corporation could delay or prevent a change in control.
Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may
discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an
interested shareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder, even if a change
of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws
contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock.
These provisions include the following:
• the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval;
• the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent;
25

--- Page 115 ---

• advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals;
• the ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder
approval;
• a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;
• the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and
• the ability of our Board of Directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws.
On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips
and to license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if an individual
or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our
common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The Microsoft provision and the
other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA. These provisions could also
discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause
us to take other corporate actions they desire.
Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or
fulfilling our contractual obligations.
In March 2020, we issued $1.50 billion of the 2.85% Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2040, $2.00
billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2050, and $500 million of the 3.70% Notes Due 2060, or collectively, the March 2020
Notes. In September 2016, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due
2026, or collectively, the September 2016 Notes.
Our indebtedness may limit our ability to use our cash flow or borrow additional funds for working capital, capital
expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes. Additionally, our obligation to make payments
related to the Notes could impact our cash balance and limit our ability to use our cash for our capital return program
and our other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments and other
general corporate purposes.

PART II
ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER
PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our common
stock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of February 19,
2021, we had approximately 303 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.
Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares for a
total cost of $7.08 billion through January 31, 2021. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into
treasury stock.
The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share
repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other
factors. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may
be suspended at any time at our discretion.
In fiscal year 2021, we paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends. As of January 31, 2021, we are authorized, subject
to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did
not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2021.
Restricted Stock Unit Share Withholding
We also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon
the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our employee equity incentive program. During fiscal year 2021, we
withheld approximately 3 million shares at a total cost of $942 million through net share settlements. Refer to Note 4 of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further
discussion regarding our equity incentive plans.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction
with “Item 1A. Risk Factors”, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other
cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase,
hold or sell shares of our common stock.
Overview
Our Company and Our Businesses
NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Starting with a
focus on PC graphics, we extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI. Fueled by the sustained
demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA leveraged its GPU architecture to create
platforms for virtual reality, HPC, and AI.
Through fiscal year 2020, our reportable segments were GPU and Tegra Processor. We changed our reportable
segments to "Graphics" and "Compute & Networking" starting with the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.
Our Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and
related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise workstation
graphics; vGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment
systems.
Our Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated
computing; Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development
agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms.
All prior period comparisons presented reflect our new reportable segments. Our market platforms – Gaming,
Professional Visualization, Data Center, Automotive, OEM and Other – remain unchanged.
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in
Delaware in April 1998.
Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges
Pending Acquisition of Arm Limited
On September 13, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Arm and SoftBank for us to acquire, from SoftBank,
all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion. We paid $2 billion in cash at signing,
or the Signing Consideration, and will pay upon closing of the acquisition $10 billion in cash and issue to SoftBank 44.3
million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $21.5 billion. The transaction includes a potential earn
out, which is contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by Arm during the fiscal year
ending March 31, 2022. If the financial performance targets are achieved, Softbank can elect to receive either up to an
additional $5 billion in cash or up to an additional 10.3 million shares of our common stock. We will issue up to $1.5
billion in restricted stock units to Arm employees after closing. The $2 billion paid upon signing was allocated between
advanced consideration for the acquisition of $1.36 billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from
Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of $0.47 billion, both with a 20-year term. The closing of the acquisition is subject to
customary closing conditions, including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and
expiration of any related mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization and distribution of
Arm’s IoT Services Group and certain other assets and liabilities. We are engaged with regulators in the United States,
the United Kingdom, the European Union, China and other jurisdictions. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under
certain circumstances, we will be refunded $1.25 billion of the Signing Consideration. The $2 billion payment upon
signing was allocated on a fair value basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the
Purchase Agreement. We believe the closing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.
Demand
Our products are manufactured based on estimates of customers’ future demand and our manufacturing lead times are
very long. This could lead to a significant mismatch between supply and demand, giving rise to product shortages or
excess inventory, and make our demand forecast more uncertain. We sell many of our products through a channel
model, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers. As a result, the decisions made
29

--- Page 119 ---

by our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditions and the changing demand
for our products could impact our financial results. In order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery
schedules for our customers, we may build inventory for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur, may build
inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pent-up
demand. In periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, we may place non-
cancellable inventory orders significantly in advance of our normal lead times, pay premiums or provide deposits to
secure normal and incremental future supply, which could negatively impact our financial results. Demand for our
products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, competitor announcements, and
competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue. For example, our GPUs for
gaming are capable of digital currency mining. Demand and use of GPUs for cryptocurrency has fluctuated in the past
and is likely to continue to change quickly. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including changes in the prices of
cryptocurrencies, can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to
cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may also
create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. Additionally, consumer
behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our Gaming, Data Center and mobile workstation
and laptop products and suppressed corporate demand for desktop workstations, has made it more difficult for us to
estimate future demand, and these challenges may be more pronounced in the future if and when the effects of the
pandemic subside. In estimating demand and evaluating trends, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may prove
to be incorrect.
COVID-19
The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic is prompting governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures
including restrictions on travel, temporary business closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders. It has
significantly impacted global economic activity and caused volatility and disruption in global financial markets. Since
March 2020, most of our employees have been working remotely and we have temporarily prohibited most business
travel.
Our Gaming and Data Center market platforms have benefited from stronger demand as people continue to work, learn,
and play from home. In Professional Visualization, mobile workstations continue to benefit from work-from-home
trends, and desktop workstation demand has started to recover, although not back to pre-COVID levels. In Automotive,
COVID is no longer having a significant impact on demand. Throughout our supply chain, stronger demand globally has
limited the availability of capacity and components, particularly in Gaming.
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the timing and overall demand from customers and the availability of supply
chain, logistical services and component supply may have a material net negative impact on our business and financial
results. Refer to Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information under the heading “Risk
Factors”.
We believe our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, along with commercial paper and
other short-term liquidity arrangements, will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital asset purchases,
dividends, debt repayments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations.
Fiscal Year 2021 Summary

Revenue for fiscal year 2021 was $16.68 billion, up 53% from a year earlier.
30

--- Page 120 ---

From a market-platform perspective, Gaming revenue was up 41% from a year ago, reflecting higher sales across
desktop and laptop GPUs for gaming, and game-console SOCs. GPUs for gaming benefited from the ramp of our GeForce
RTX 30 Series based on the NVIDIA Ampere architecture.
Professional Visualization revenue was down 13% from a year ago due to lower sales of GPUs for desktop workstations
as enterprise demand was impacted by COVID.
Data Center revenue was up 124% from a year ago. Revenue growth was driven by our Mellanox acquisition and the
ramp of the NVIDIA Ampere GPU architecture. In fiscal year 2021, Mellanox revenue contributed 10% of total company
revenue.
Automotive revenue was down 23% from a year earlier, reflecting lower revenue from the expected ramp down of
legacy infotainment modules and autonomous driving development agreements, partially offset by increases in AI
cockpit and autonomous vehicle solutions.
OEM and Other revenue was up 25% from a year ago, primarily due to higher volume of entry-level laptop GPUs.
Gross margin for fiscal year 2021 was up 30 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by product mix with higher
Data Center and lower Automotive revenue, partially offset by Mellanox acquisition-related charges.
Operating expenses for fiscal year 2021 were $5.86 billion, up 50% from a year ago. The growth was influenced by the
inclusion of Mellanox in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, employee additions and increases in employee
compensation and related expenses. Additionally, acquisition-related and other costs of $411 million primarily include
$190 million in non-recurring intangible amortization of Mellanox order backlog, $123 million in recurring amortization
of Mellanox intangible assets, and $40 million related to the pending acquisition of Arm.
Income from operations for fiscal year 2021 was $4.53 billion, up 59% from a year earlier. Net income and net income
per diluted share for fiscal year 2021 were $4.33 billion and $6.90, up 55% and 53%, respectively, from a year earlier.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $11.56 billion as of January 31, 2021, compared with $10.90
billion as of January 26, 2020. The increase primarily reflects the issuance of the $5 billion of notes in March 2020 and
cash-flow generation, partially offset by acquisitions.
We paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends in fiscal year 2021.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of
contingencies. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to business combinations,
inventories, revenue recognition, income taxes, and goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the
preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of
these critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee
has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-
K.
Business Combinations
The application of acquisition accounting to a business acquisition requires that we identify the individual assets
acquired and liabilities assumed and estimate the fair value of each. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in a business acquisition are recognized at the acquisition date, with the purchase price exceeding the fair
values being recognized as goodwill. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, liabilities
acquired and contingent obligations assumed requires management to make estimates. In certain circumstances, the
allocations of the purchase price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions and subject to revision when
we receive final information, including appraisals and other analyses. Accordingly, the measurement period for such
purchase price allocations will end when the information, or the facts and circumstances, becomes available, but will
not exceed twelve months. We will recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period of resolution,
including the effect on earnings of any amounts that would have been recorded in previous periods if the accounting had
been completed at the acquisition date.
Goodwill and intangible assets often represent a significant portion of the assets acquired in a business combination. We
recognize the fair value of an acquired intangible apart from goodwill whenever the intangible arises from contractual or
other legal rights, or when it can be separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented
or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. Intangible assets consist
primarily of technology, customer relationships, order backlog and trade name acquired in a business combination and
in-process research and development, or IPR&D. We generally assess the estimated fair values of acquired intangibles
using a combination of valuation techniques. To estimate fair value, we are required to make certain estimates and
assumptions, including future economic and market conditions, revenue growth, technology migration curve, and risk-
adjusted discount rates. Our estimates require significant judgment and are based on historical data, various internal
estimates, and external sources. Our assessment of IPR&D also includes consideration of the risk of the projects not
achieving technological feasibility.
Inventories
Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,
first-out basis. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net
realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of
products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to
assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions,
changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence
because of changing technology and customer requirements, failure to estimate customer demand properly, or
32

--- Page 122 ---

unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition. In addition, cancellation or deferral of customer purchase
orders could result in our holding excess inventory.
The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was
insignificant in fiscal years 2021 and 2020. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to
purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our third-party
manufacturers' lead times and constraints. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing
actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand
for our products.
Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further
discussion.
Revenue Recognition
We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements,
and software licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract
with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction
price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on
a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling
price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
Product Sales Revenue
Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold along with
support or extended warranty. Support and extended warranty revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or
as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes
collected from customers.
For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for
estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if
product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional
sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.
Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in
various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that
are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also
promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential
rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.
License and Development Arrangements
Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual
property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development
services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We
measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost
required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision
for such loss in that period.
Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form
10-K for additional information.
Income Taxes
We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or
refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or
liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards;
and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on
available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.
Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing
with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change
33

--- Page 123 ---

based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in
the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we
recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether,
and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or
if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit
or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.
As of January 31, 2021, we had a valuation allowance of $728 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax
assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable
income, tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes
acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-
likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period.
We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon
audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form
10-K for additional information.
Goodwill
Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if indicators of
potential impairment exist, using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. Our impairment review process
compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. We changed our
reportable segments to "Graphics" and "Compute & Networking" starting with the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. As a
result, our reporting units also changed, and we reassigned the goodwill balance to the new reporting units based on
their relative fair values. We determined there was no goodwill impairment immediately prior to the reorganization. As
of January 31, 2021, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $4.19 billion and the amount of goodwill allocated to our
Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $347 million and $3.85 billion, respectively. Determining the
fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and
assumptions. We also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting
units. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and
inherently uncertain.
We performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 using a qualitative
assessment and concluded there was no goodwill impairment.
Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form
10-K for additional information.

Graphics $ 9,834 $ 7,639 $ 2,195 29 %
Compute & Networking 6,841 3,279 3,562 109 %
Total $ 16,675 $ 10,918 $ 5,757 53 %
Graphics - Graphics segment revenue increased by 29% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, reflecting
growth in GeForce GPUs and game console SOCs, partially offset by lower sales of Quadro/NVIDIA RTX workstations.
Compute & Networking - Compute & Networking segment revenue increased by 109% in fiscal year 2021 compared to
fiscal year 2020, reflecting the addition of Mellanox acquired on April 27, 2020 and the continued ramp of NVIDIA
Ampere GPU architecture systems and new products.
Concentration of Revenue
Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 81% and 92% of total revenue for fiscal
years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the
location to which the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different
location.
No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2021. Dell represented approximately 11% of our
total revenue for fiscal year 2020, and was attributable primarily to the Graphics segment.
Gross Profit and Gross Margin
Gross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the
cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging,
board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases,
final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, and shipping costs. Cost of
35

--- Page 125 ---

revenue also includes acquisition-related costs, development costs for license and service arrangements, IP-related
costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing.
Our overall gross margin was 62.3% and 62.0% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in fiscal year
2021 was driven by product mix with higher Data Center and lower Automotive revenue, partially offset by Mellanox
acquisition-related charges, including a non-recurring inventory step-up charge of $161 million and ongoing intangible
asset amortization of $263 million.
Inventory provisions totaled $116 million and $161 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales of
inventory that was previously written-off or written-down totaled $145 million for both fiscal years 2021 and 2020. As a
result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was insignificant in both fiscal years 2021 and 2020.
A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows:
Graphics - The gross margin of our Graphics segment increased during fiscal year 2021 when compared to fiscal year
2020, primarily driven by product mix with lower legacy automotive infotainment revenue and higher margin mix
within Quadro/Nvidia RTX.
Compute & Networking - The gross margin of our Compute & Networking segment increased during fiscal year 2021
when compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily driven by the addition of Mellanox products, higher margins in Data
Center compute systems, and lower product mix of certain Automotive solutions.
Operating Expenses
Year Ended
January 31, January 26, $ %
2021 2020 Change Change
($ in millions)
Research and development expenses $ 3,924 $ 2,829 $ 1,095 39 %

Sales, general and administrative expenses 1,940 1,093 847 77 %
% of net revenue 11.6 % 10.0 %
Total operating expenses $ 5,864 $ 3,922 $ 1,942 50 %
Research and Development
Research and development expenses increased by 39% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, driven
primarily by the acquisition of Mellanox. In addition, the increases reflect employee compensation and related costs,
including stock-based compensation, and infrastructure costs.
Sales, General and Administrative
Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 77% in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, driven
primarily by the Mellanox acquisition. In addition, the increases reflect employee compensation and related costs,
including stock-based compensation.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was
$57 million and $178 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily
due to lower interest rates earned on our investments.
Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our September
2016 Notes and March 2020 Notes. Interest expense was $184 million and $52 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020,
respectively.
Income Taxes
We recognized income tax expense of $77 million and $174 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our
annual effective tax rate was 1.7% and 5.9% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.
36

--- Page 126 ---

The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a
decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United States tax and an increase of tax benefits from stock-
based compensation.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily
to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel, and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was
lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, and excess tax benefits
related to stock-based compensation.

Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (19,675) $ 6,145
Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ 3,804 $ (792)
As of January 31, 2021, we had $11.56 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $664
million from the end of fiscal year 2020. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income
securities, the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain maturity limits on our portfolio.
In the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we paid $2 billion as part of the proposed acquisition of Arm, which was allocated
between advanced consideration for the acquisition of $1.36 billion, the prepayment of intellectual property licenses
from Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of $0.47 billion. The cash flow allocation of the payment resulted in $1.36 billion
of advanced consideration included in acquisitions, net of cash acquired, $0.17 billion for the intellectual property license
included in purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and $0.47 billion in prepayment of
royalties included in changes in prepaid expenses and other assets.
Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020, due to higher net
income, higher non-cash adjustments, partially offset by changes in working capital. Changes in working capital include
increases in purchases of inventory and outstanding trade receivables, both due to higher fiscal year 2021 revenue, and
a prepayment of royalties to Arm.
Cash used in investing activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to cash provided in fiscal year 2020, which
primarily reflects cash used for the acquisition of Mellanox and the advanced consideration for the proposed acquisition
of Arm, higher purchases of marketable securities, higher purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets,
and lower sales of marketable securities, offset by higher maturities of marketable securities.
Cash provided by financing activities increased in fiscal year 2021 compared to cash used in fiscal year 2020, which
primarily reflects the debt issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, offset by payments related to tax on restricted
stock units.

Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated
by our operations. As of January 31, 2021, we had $11.56 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We
believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months,
including our proposed acquisition of Arm. We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our
access to external capital, to ensure we can adequately and efficiently finance our capital requirements beyond twelve
months. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K for additional information.
Our marketable securities consist of debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly rated
corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, and certificates of deposits. These marketable
securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
During fiscal year 2022, we expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the
cash generated by our operations to fund our capital investments of approximately $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion related to
property and equipment, including construction of a new building at our Santa Clara campus.
We have approximately $1.38 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held outside the U.S. for which
we have not accrued any related foreign or state taxes if we repatriate these amounts to the U.S. Other than that,
substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the U.S. as of January 31, 2021
are available for use in the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Capital Return to Shareholders
In fiscal year 2021, we paid $395 million in quarterly cash dividends. Our cash dividend program and the payment of
future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that the dividend program
and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.
As of January 31, 2021, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our
common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2021.
Outstanding Indebtedness and Credit Facilities
We have outstanding $1.50 billion of Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of Notes Due 2040, $2.00 billion of Notes Due 2050,
and $500 million of Notes due 2060, or collectively, the March 2020 Notes.
We have outstanding $1.00 billion of Notes due 2021 and $1.00 billion of Notes due 2026, or collectively, the September
2016 Notes.
We have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $575 million for general corporate purposes and can
obtain revolving loan commitments up to $425 million. As of January 31, 2021, we had not borrowed any amounts under
this agreement.
We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of January 31, 2021, we
had not issued any commercial paper.
Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form
10-K for further discussion.
Contractual Obligations
We have $157 million of long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox and unrecognized tax
benefits of $395 million, which includes related interest and penalties of $43 million recorded in non-current income tax
payable as of January 31, 2021. We are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of any potential tax liability, interest
payments, or penalties in individual years due to uncertainties in the underlying income tax positions and the timing of
the effective settlement of such tax positions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service for
our fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item
15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

For a description of our long-term debt, purchase obligations, and operating lease obligations, refer to Note 12, Note 13,
and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K,
respectively.
Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K for a discussion of adoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Investment and Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to interest rate risk related to our fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. The investment
portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs and strategic
growth of our businesses.
As of January 31, 2021, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our investment portfolio. According to our analysis,
parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5%, taking into account a yield floor of 0%, would result in a
decrease in fair value for these investments of $24 million, or an increase in fair value for these investments of $8
million, respectively.
In September 2016, we issued $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2026. In March
2020, we issued $1.50 billion of Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of Notes Due 2040, $2.00 billion of Notes Due 2050, and
$500 million of Notes due 2060. We carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in
interest rates. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk
We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign
currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant. The impact of
foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2021
and 2020.
Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and,
therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to
other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete.
Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers
raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international operations and incur
expenditures in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are
adversely affected by a weaker dollar.
We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our
operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge
relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in
earnings or ineffectiveness should occur.
We also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary
assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not
designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other
income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets
and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.
If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, the amount recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have
been approximately $84 million and $43 million lower as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, respectively.
Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset a
corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized.
39

--- Page 129 ---

If an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have
resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of approximately $44 million and $29 million as of January 31,
2021 and January 26, 2020, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net by
corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming the
hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of January 31, 2021, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as
such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021 based on the criteria set forth in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Based on our evaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2021.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021 has been audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included
herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Other than the acquisition of Mellanox that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, there were no
changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting despite the fact that virtually all of our
employees are working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continually monitoring and assessing the
COVID-19 situation on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their operating effectiveness. We are in the
process of integrating Mellanox into our systems and control environment. We believe that we have taken the necessary
steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting during this integration.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure
controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how
well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control
system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within
NVIDIA have been detected.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of NVIDIA Corporation
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries (the
"Company") as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income,
comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31,
2021, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2)
(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control
over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2021, based on criteria established in
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts
for leases in fiscal year 2020.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item
9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's
internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the
Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of
material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting
was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that
respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated
financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
44

--- Page 134 ---

management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated
financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate
to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our
opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit
matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they
relate.
Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd.- Valuation of Developed Technology and In-process Research and Development
Intangible Assets Acquired
As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in fiscal year 2021 the Company completed the
acquisition of Mellanox Technologies Ltd. for consideration of approximately $7.13 billion, of which $1,640 million of
developed technology and $630 million of in-process research and development intangible assets were recorded. The
fair values of developed technology and in-process research and development intangible assets were determined using
the multi-period excess earnings method. As disclosed by management, management applied significant judgment in
estimating the fair value of the intangible assets acquired, which involved the use of certain estimates and assumptions,
including future economic and market conditions, revenue growth, the technology migration curve, and risk-adjusted
discount rates.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the developed
technology and in-process research and development intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Mellanox
Technologies Ltd. is a critical audit matter are (i) the high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in applying
procedures relating to the fair value measurement of developed technology and in-process research and development
intangible assets acquired due to the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate, (ii) significant
audit effort in evaluating management’s assumptions relating to the estimate, such as revenue growth and the
technology migration curve, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and
knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our
overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls
relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of the intangible assets and
controls over development of the assumptions related to the revenue growth and the technology migration curve. These
procedures also included, among others, reading the purchase agreement and testing management’s process for
estimating the fair value of the developed technology and in-process research and development intangible assets
acquired. Testing management’s process included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation method and the
reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to the revenue growth and the technology migration curve for
the intangible assets acquired, and using professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist with the
evaluation. Evaluating the reasonableness of the revenue growth involved considering the past performance of the
acquired business as well as economic and industry forecasts. The technology migration curve was evaluated by
considering the revenue attribution between existing technology and in-process research and development based on the
assessment of the separation of forecasted future revenue between developed products and new generation products
and the technology carryover rate.
Valuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories
As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory
provisions to write-down inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most
of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the Company’s inventory levels
and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions. As
45

--- Page 135 ---

disclosed by management, the inventory provisions developed include assumptions about future demand and market
conditions. As of January 31, 2021, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $1,826 million.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories,
specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, is a critical audit matter are the significant judgments by
management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including developing assumptions related
to future demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in
performing procedures and evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our
overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls
relating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including controls over management’s
assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures also included, among others, testing
management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories; evaluating the appropriateness
of management’s approach; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the approach;
and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.
Evaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the
assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product
life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, (iii) changes in technology, and (iv) comparing prior
period estimates to actual results of the same period.

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Our Company
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in
Delaware in April 1998.
All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.
Fiscal Year
We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal year 2021 is a 53-week year. Fiscal
years 2020 and 2019 were both 52-week years.
Reclassifications
Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.
Principles of Consolidation
Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including
those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories,
income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other
charges, and other contingencies. The inputs into our judgments and estimates consider the economic implications of
COVID-19. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
Revenue Recognition
We derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements,
and software licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract
with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction
price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated on
a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling
price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
Product Sales Revenue
Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that
reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold along with
support or extended warranty. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period,
or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes
collected from customers.
For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for
estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if
product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional
sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.
Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in
various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that
are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also
promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential
rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.

License and Development Arrangements
Our license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual
property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development
services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We
measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost
required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision
for such loss in that period.
Software Licensing
Our software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer.
Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over
which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with post-contract customer
support, or PCS. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the
customer. PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.
Product Warranties
We generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or
replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated
cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may
offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and
indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.
Stock-based Compensation
We use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair
value of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate
financial performance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value
of performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for
RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service
period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the
fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at
the commencement of an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our
ESPP is expensed using an accelerated amortization model. Additionally, we estimate forfeitures annually based on
historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those
estimates.
Litigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs
From time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. There are many
uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-
party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If information
becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements
is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance
with U.S. GAAP. However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our
estimates, which could require us to record additional costs.
Foreign Currency Remeasurement
We use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets
and liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and
liabilities such as property and equipment, and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and
expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to
the previously noted balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from
foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income
and to date have not been significant.

Income Taxes
We recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or
refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or
liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards;
and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on
available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.
Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing
with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change
based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in
the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we
recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether,
and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or
if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit
or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.
As of January 31, 2021, we had a valuation allowance of $728 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax
assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable
income, tax attributes usage limitation by certain jurisdictions, and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes
acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-
likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period.
We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon
audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
Net Income Per Share
Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially
dilutive shares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the
effect of equity awards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when
their effect is anti-dilutive.
Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
We consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three
months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt
investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased. We currently classify our investments as
current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current operations.
We generally classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities related to debt securities at the date of acquisition
as available-for-sale. These available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains
and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of
tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of
marketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income
(expense), net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.
All of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. If the estimated fair value of
an available-for-sale debt securities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused
by expected credit losses and write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than not we will be
required or we intend to sell the securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Allowances for credit losses and
write-downs are recognized in other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their
fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020. Marketable securities
are comprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses
54

--- Page 144 ---

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair value
of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as
either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative
depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as
fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting
losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-
flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other
comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in
earnings. For derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in
earnings.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents,
marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed
income securities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our
portfolio duration. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an
allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an
amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit
insurance and letters of credit.
Accounts Receivable
We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for expected losses resulting from the inability of our
customers to make required payments. We determine this allowance by identifying amounts for specific customer
issues as well as amounts based on overall estimated exposure. Factors impacting the allowance include the level of
gross receivables, the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit
insurance or letters of credit.
Inventories
Inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in,
first-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including
wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead
associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory
products and other component parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the
lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess
quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to
assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it
creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line
method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Once an asset is identified for
retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss
is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years. Depreciation expense includes the
amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under finance
leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Leases
We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12
months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease
liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for
the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.
Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments
discounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and
prepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease
55

NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Continued)
when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over
the lease term.
We combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.
Goodwill
Goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators of
potential impairment exist. For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or a
quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis.
Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events
and factors affecting the reporting units.
Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting
unit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not
limited to, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples
from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding
industry economic factors and the future profitability of our business.
Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets
Intangible assets primarily represent acquired intangible assets including developed technology, in-process research
and development, or IPR&D, and customer relationships, as well as rights acquired under technology licenses, patents,
and acquired intellectual property. We currently amortize our intangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging
from two to twenty years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset
are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortization
method. We initially capitalize the fair value of IPR&D as an intangible asset with an indefinite life. When IPR&D projects
are completed, we reclassify the IPR&D as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortize over the asset’s
estimated useful life.
Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group
may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of
the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated
by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows,
an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds
the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future
cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be
separately presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying
amount or fair value less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated.
Business Combination
We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and
intangible assets acquired, including IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the
purchase price over the fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and
assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing
intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used
to determine the present value of these cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and,
therefore, actual results may differ from the estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one
year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the
corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value
of the purchase price of an acquisition, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our
Consolidated Statements of Income.
Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.

Investment in Non-Affiliated Entities
Non-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis only
if an impairment or observable price adjustment occurs in the period with changes in fair value recorded through net
income. These investments are valued using observable and unobservable inputs or data in an inactive market and the
valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The estimated fair
value is based on quantitative and qualitative factors including subsequent financing activities by the investee.
Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard to replace the existing
incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires
consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates for accounts
receivable and other financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt securities. We adopted the standard in the
first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and the impact of the adoption was not material to our consolidated financial
statements.
Note 2 - Business Combination
Pending Acquisition of Arm Limited
On September 13, 2020, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Arm and SoftBank for us to acquire, from SoftBank
all allotted and issued ordinary shares of Arm in a transaction valued at $40 billion. We paid $2 billion in Signing
Consideration and will pay upon closing of the acquisition $10 billion in cash and issue to SoftBank 44.3 million shares of
our common stock with an aggregate value of $21.5 billion. The transaction includes a potential earn out, which is
contingent on the achievement of certain financial performance targets by Arm during the fiscal year ending March 31,
2022. If the financial targets are achieved, SoftBank can elect to receive either up to an additional $5 billion in cash or up
to an additional 10.3 million shares of our common stock. We will issue up to $1.5 billion in restricted stock units to Arm
employees after closing. The $2 billion paid upon signing was allocated between advanced consideration for the
acquisition of $1.36 billion and the prepayment of intellectual property licenses from Arm of $0.17 billion and royalties of
$0.47 billion, both with a 20-year term. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions,
including receipt of specified governmental and regulatory consents and approvals and expiration of any related
mandatory waiting period, and Arm's implementation of the reorganization and distribution of Arm’s IoT Services Group
and certain other assets and liabilities. We are engaged with regulators in the United States, the United Kingdom, the
European Union, China and other jurisdictions. If the Purchase Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances,
we will be refunded $1.25 billion of the Signing Consideration. The $2 billion payment upon signing was allocated on a
fair value basis and any refund of the Signing Consideration will use stated values in the Purchase Agreement. We
believe the closing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of calendar year 2022.
Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.
On April 27, 2020, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of Mellanox for a total purchase consideration
of $7.13 billion. Mellanox is a supplier of high-performance interconnect products for computing, storage and
communications applications. We acquired Mellanox to optimize data center workloads to scale across the entire
computing, networking, and storage stack.

Mellanox ordinary shares.
(2) Represents the cash consideration for the settlement of approximately 249 thousand Mellanox stock options held by employees and non-
employee directors of Mellanox.
(3) Represents the fair value of Mellanox’s stock-based compensation awards attributable to pre-combination services.
We allocated the purchase price to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
the estimated fair values.
The goodwill is primarily attributable to the planned growth in the combined business of NVIDIA and Mellanox. Goodwill
is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually, absent any interim indicators of
impairment. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition is not expected to be deductible for foreign tax purposes. Goodwill
arising from the Mellanox acquisition has been allocated to the Compute and Networking segment. Refer to Note 17 –
Segment Information for further details on segments.
The operating results of Mellanox have been included in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2021 since
the acquisition date of April 27, 2020. Revenue attributable to Mellanox was approximately 10% for fiscal year 2021.
There is not a practical way to determine net income attributable to Mellanox due to integration. Acquisition-related
costs attributable to Mellanox of $28 million were included in selling, general and administrative expense for fiscal year
2021.

Customer relationships (2) 440 3 years
Based on actual

Trade names (4) 70 5 years
Total identified finite-lived intangible assets 2,340

Total identified intangible assets $ 2,970
(1) The fair value of developed technology was identified using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method.
(2) Customer relationships represent the fair value of the existing relationships using the With and Without Method.
(3) Order backlog represents primarily the fair value of purchase arrangements with customers using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method. The
intangible asset was fully amortized as of January 31, 2021.
(4) Trade names primarily relate to Mellanox trade names and fair value was determined by applying the Relief-from-Royalty Method under the
income approach.
(5) The fair value of IPR&D was determined using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method.
The fair value of the finite-lived intangible assets will be amortized over the estimated useful lives based on the pattern
in which the economic benefits are expected to be received to cost of revenue and operating expenses.
Mellanox had an IPR&D project associated with the next generation interconnect product that had not yet reached
technological feasibility as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, we recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset of
$630 million for the fair value of this project, which will initially not be amortized. Instead, the project will be tested for
impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the project may be impaired or
may have reached technological feasibility. Once the project reaches technological feasibility, we will begin to amortize
the intangible asset over its estimated useful life.

Dividend yield 0.1%-0.3% 0.3%-0.4% 0.3%-0.4%
For ESPP shares, the expected term represents the average term from the first day of the offering period to the

on Treasury bills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated
using historical volatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU, PSU, and market-based
PSU awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs, and market-
based PSUs are discounted for the dividend yield.

In 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended and
restated, the 2007 Plan.
The 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted
stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based
awards to employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. As of January
31, 2021, up to 244 million shares of our common stock could be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the
2007 Plan, of which 2 million shares were issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options. All options are fully
vested, the last of which will expire by May 2024 if not exercised. Currently, we grant RSUs, PSUs and market-based
PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 31, 2021, there were 37 million shares available for future
issuance.
Subject to certain exceptions, RSUs and PSUs granted to employees either vest (A) over a four-year period, subject to
continued service, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and
6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter, or (B) over a three-year period, subject to continued service, with 40% vesting on a
pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and 7.5% vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-
based PSUs vest 100% on approximately the three-year anniversary of the date of grant. However, the number of shares
subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is generally determined by the Compensation
Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria.
Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In 2012, our shareholders approved the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently amended and restated,
the 2012 Plan.
Employees who participate may have up to 10% of their earnings withheld to the purchase of shares of common stock.
Starting in March 2021, employees who participate may have up to 15% of their earnings withheld to purchase shares of
common stock. The Board may decrease this percentage at its discretion. Each offering period is approximately 24
months, which is generally divided into four purchase periods of six months. The price of common stock purchased
under our 2012 Plan will be equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the
commencement date of each offering period and the fair market value on each purchase date within the offering. As of
January 31, 2021, we had 60 million shares reserved for future issuance under the 2012 Plan.

Note 6 - Goodwill
We changed our reportable segments to "Graphics" and "Compute & Networking" starting with the first quarter of fiscal
year 2021, as discussed in Note 17 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, our reporting
units also changed, and we reassigned the goodwill balance to the new reporting units based on their relative fair
values. Comparative periods presented reflect this change. We determined there was no goodwill impairment
immediately prior to the reorganization. As of January 31, 2021, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $4.19 billion
and the amount of goodwill allocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $347 million and
$3.85 billion, respectively. As of January 26, 2020, the total carrying amount of goodwill was $618 million and the
amount of goodwill allocated to our Graphics and Compute & Networking reporting units was $347 million and
$271 million, respectively. Goodwill increased by $3.57 billion in fiscal year 2021 due to goodwill of $3.43 billion arising
from the Mellanox acquisition, and goodwill of $143 million from other acquisition activities, all of which were allocated
to the Compute & Networking reporting unit. During the fourth quarters of fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, we
completed our annual impairment tests and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years.

been amortized. Once the project reaches technological feasibility, we will begin to amortize the intangible asset over its estimated useful life.
Refer to Note 2 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.
Amortization expense associated with intangible assets for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $612 million, $25
million, and $29 million, respectively. Future amortization expense related to the net carrying amount of intangible
assets as of January 31, 2021 is estimated to be $548 million in fiscal year 2022, $545 million in fiscal year 2023, $423

Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements
on our operating expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains
or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to
operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The
fair value of the contracts was not significant as of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020.
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary
assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not
designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other
income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets
and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.
The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of January 31,
2021 and January 26, 2020:

realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to foreign currency
forward contracts within the next twelve months was not significant.
During fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting
treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be
highly effective. Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.

In connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities to cover the
indemnified party for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual property
indemnification provisions in our technology related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments
cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have not recorded
any liability for such indemnifications.

Securities Litigation, filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2020. The amended complaint asserts that NVIDIA and
certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange
Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the
impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also allege
that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs seek
class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses,
including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On June 29, 2020,
NVIDIA moved to dismiss the amended complaint on the basis that plaintiffs failed to state any claims for violations of
the securities laws by NVIDIA or the individual defendants. As of September 14, 2020, the motion was fully briefed but
the Court has not yet issued a decision.
The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California,
captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative
Litigation, remains stayed pending resolution of NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint in the In Re NVIDIA
Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment,
waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the
dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of
cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including
reforms and improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures.
The putative derivative actions initially filed September 24, 2019 and pending in the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware, Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-
cv-01798- UNA), remain stayed pending resolution of NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint in the In Re NVIDIA
Corporation Securities Litigation action. The lawsuits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment,
insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the
Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and
the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including
disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures.
It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations received from shareholders, with respect to these same or
other matters, naming NVIDIA and/or its officers and directors as defendants.
Accounting for Loss Contingencies
As of January 31, 2021, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings
described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically
described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are
engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no
assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse

The tax effect of temporary differences that gives rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are

Research and other tax credit carryforwards 650 605
Operating lease liabilities 120 114
Net operating loss carryforwards 100 62

Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries (111) (40)
Operating lease assets (111) (107)
Gross deferred tax liabilities (413) (148)
Net deferred tax asset (1) $ 565 $ 519
(1) Net deferred tax asset includes long-term deferred tax assets of $806 million and $548 million and long-term deferred tax liabilities of $241 million
and $29 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Long-term deferred tax liabilities are included in other long-term liabilities on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets.
We recognized an income tax expense of $77 million and $174 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, and
income tax benefit of $245 million for fiscal year 2019. Our annual effective tax rate was 1.7%, 5.9%, and (6.3)% for fiscal
years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal
year 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the proportional amount of earnings subject to United States tax and an
increase of tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2021 and
fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to an absence of tax benefits related to the
enactment of the TCJA and a decrease of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due
primarily to income earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Israel and Hong Kong, where the tax rate
was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, excess tax benefits
related to stock-based compensation, and the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA in 2019.
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we completed the acquisition of Mellanox. As a result of the acquisition,
we recorded $256 million of net deferred tax liabilities primarily on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of the
acquired intangible assets and undistributed earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries. We also recorded $153 million of
long-term tax liabilities related to tax basis differences in Mellanox. The net deferred tax liabilities and long-term tax
liabilities are based upon certain assumptions underlying our purchase price allocation. As a result of the acquisition, as
of January 31, 2021, we intend to indefinitely reinvest approximately $1.16 billion of cumulative undistributed earnings
held by Mellanox non-U.S. subsidiaries. We have not provided the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for
temporary differences related to investments in Mellanox non-U.S. subsidiaries as the determination of such amount is
not practicable.
As of January 31, 2021 and January 26, 2020, we had a valuation allowance of $728 million and $621 million,
respectively, related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be
realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax

assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the
period.
As of January 31, 2021, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $333 million, $308 million
and $344 million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023 and 2022,
respectively. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $344 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of
January 31, 2021, we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $238 million that will begin to expire in fiscal year
2035. We have state research tax credit carryforwards of $987 million, of which $944 million is attributable to the State
of California and may be carried over indefinitely, and $43 million is attributable to various other states and will begin to
expire in fiscal year 2022. Our tax attributes, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and
may be adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and
circumstances. Utilization of federal, state, and foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may also be
subject to limitations due to ownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar
state and foreign tax provisions. If any such limitations apply, the federal, state, or foreign net operating loss and tax
credit carryforwards, as applicable, may expire or be denied before utilization.
As of January 31, 2021, we had $776 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $606 million would affect our
effective tax rate if recognized. However, $132 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax
positions taken, that, if recognized, would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a
full valuation allowance. The $606 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 31, 2021 consisted of $352 million
recorded in non-current income taxes payable, $5 million recorded in current income taxes payable, and $249 million
reflected as a reduction to the related deferred tax assets.
A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

2021 2020 2019
(In millions)
Balance at beginning of period $ 583 $ 477 $ 447
Increases in tax positions for current year 158 104 129

Decreases in tax positions for prior years (11) — (141)
Settlements (5) — —
Lapse in statute of limitations (9) (5) (10)
Balance at end of period $ 776 $ 583 $ 477
(1) The fiscal year 2021 balance represents prior year gross unrecognized tax benefits recorded as a result of the Mellanox acquisition.
We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we anticipate
payment or receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term liability, or
reduction of long-term deferred tax assets or amount refundable if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income
taxes during a period beyond a year.
Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax
expense. As of January 31, 2021, January 26, 2020, and January 27, 2019, we had accrued $44 million, $31 million, and
$21 million, respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not
included as a component of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 31, 2021, unrecognized tax benefits of $352
million and the related interest and penalties of $43 million are included in non-current income taxes payable, and
unrecognized tax benefits of $5 million and the related interest and penalties of $1 million are included in current
income taxes payable.
While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be
greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to
be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise
resolved. As of January 31, 2021, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions
will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.

We are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 31, 2021, the
significant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include the United States, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China,
United Kingdom, Germany, Israel, and India for fiscal years 2005 through 2020. As of January 31, 2021, the significant
tax jurisdictions for which we are currently under examination include the United States, United Kingdom, Germany,
Israel and India, for fiscal years 2005 through 2019.
Note 15 - Shareholders’ Equity
Capital Return Program
Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.
Through January 31, 2021, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares under our share repurchase
program for a total cost of $7.08 billion. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury
stock. As of January 31, 2021, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common
stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022.
During fiscal year 2021, we paid $395 million in cash dividends to our shareholders.
Note 16 - Employee Retirement Plans
We provide tax-qualified defined contribution plans to eligible employees in the U.S. and certain other countries. Our
contribution expense for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $120 million, $76 million, and $70 million, respectively.
Note 17 - Segment Information
Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial
information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making decisions and assessing financial
performance. In the prior fiscal year, we had reported two operating segments: GPU and Tegra Processor. During the
first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we changed our operating segments to be consistent with the revised manner in which
our CODM reviews our financial performance and allocates resources. The two new operating segments are "Graphics"
and "Compute & Networking". Comparative periods presented reflect this change. Our operating segments are
equivalent to our reportable segments.
Our Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and
related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro/NVIDIA RTX GPUs for enterprise design; GRID
software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive platforms for infotainment systems. Our
Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing;
Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements,
and autonomous vehicle solutions; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms.
Operating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or
expenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments.
The “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Graphics or Compute &
Networking for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include
stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related costs, legal
settlement costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.
Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and
amortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment.
However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is
not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the
same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the
“All Other” category.
