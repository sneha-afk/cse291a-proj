While the Board benefits from the experience and institutional knowledge that2our longer-serving directors bring, it has also brought in new perspectives and ideas by appointing three new directors inthe last five years.  Furthermore, James C. Gaither, who has served on our Board since 1999, is not seeking re-electioneffective as of the 2020 Meeting.  Below are the skills and competencies that our NCGC and Board consider important forour directors to have in light of our current business and future market opportunities, and the number of directors whopossess them: Our NCGC and Board also consider diversity in business experience, professional expertise, gender and ethnic backgroundamong Board members in recommending nominees to serve as directors.Corporate Governance HighlightsOur Board is committed to strong corporate governance to promote the long-term interests of NVIDIA and our stockholders.We seek a collaborative approach to stockholder issues that affect our business and to ensure that our stockholders seeour governance and executive pay practices as well-structured.  In the Fall of 2019, we contacted stockholders holdingapproximately 1% or more of our common stock (except for brokerage firms and index funds who we know do not engagein individual conversations with companies), representing an aggregate ownership of 31%, to gain insights into their viewson corporate governance, executive compensation and environmental, social and corporate governance issues.  Ourmanagement and Lead Director met with stockholders holding, in total, 19% of our common stock.Highlights of our corporate governance practices include:  ü Proxy accessü Declassified Boardü Majority voting for directorsü Active Board oversight of risk and risk managementü All Board members independent, except for our CEOü Independent Lead Directorü 75% or greater attendance by each Board member at      meetings of the Board and applicable committeesü Independent directors frequently meet in executive sessionsü At least annual Board and committee self-assessmentsü Annual stockholder outreach, including NCGC participationü Stock ownership guidelines for our directors and executiveofficersApproval of Executive Compensation for Fiscal 2020 (Proposal 2)We are asking our stockholders to cast a non-binding vote, also known as “say-on-pay,” to approve our NEOs’ compensation.The Board believes that our compensation policies and practices are effective in achieving our goals of paying forperformance; attracting, motivating and retaining a high-caliber executive team; aligning our executives’ interests withthose of our stockholders to create long-term value; and achieving simplicity and transparency with our compensationprogram. The Board and our stockholders have approved holding our “say-on-pay” votes annually. Executive Compensation HighlightsOur executive compensation program is designed to pay for performance.  We utilize compensation elements that align ourNEOs’ interests with those of our stockholders to create long-term value.  Our NEO pay is heavily weighted towardperformance-based, “at-risk” variable cash and long-term equity awards that are only earned if the Company achieves pre-established corporate financial metrics, but capped at a maximum of 200% of target (or 150% of target for our CEO’s PSUs).3For the last several years, approximately 90% of our CEO’s, and over 50% of our other NEOs’, target pay has been performance-based and at-risk, and 100% of our CEO’s equity awards have been in the form of PSUs only.At our 2019 Meeting, over 96% of the votes cast approved the compensation paid to our NEOs for Fiscal 2019.  Afterconsidering this advisory vote, the feedback from our annual stockholder outreach, and the Company’s Fiscal 2020 outlookat the time of its determination, our CC concluded that our program effectively aligned executive pay with stockholderinterests.  Therefore, the CC maintained the same general executive compensation structure for Fiscal 2020, and keptexecutive target pay essentially flat with Fiscal 2019. Financial Performance and Link to Executive PayDespite a challenging start to Fiscal 2020 with excess channel inventory in our Gaming business and a pause in hyperscalespending in our Datacenter business, our business recovered in the second half of the year.  As described above, a significantportion of our executive pay opportunities are tied to the achievement of rigorous financial measures that drive businessvalue and contribute to our long-term success.  The tables below show our goals and achievement for each of thesemeasures for the applicable period ended Fiscal 2020, and their respective impact on our executive pay:RevenueNon-GAAP Operating Income*3-Year TSRPerformanceGoalPayout as a %of TargetOpportunity(1)PerformanceGoalShares Eligible to Vestas a % of Target Opportunity(1)PerformanceGoalShares Eligible to Vestas a % of Target Opportunity(1)Threshold$10.5 billion50%$3.21 billion50%25thpercentile25%Base Operating Plan(Target for MY PSUs)$11.4 billion100%$3.75 billion100%50thpercentile100%Stretch Operating Plan(Stretch for MY PSUs)$12.0 billion200%$4.23 billion150% for CEO; 200%for our other NEOs75thpercentile150% for CEO; 200%for our other NEOsPerformance and PayoutAchieved Fiscal 2020 revenue of$10.92 billion, resulting in aVariable Cash Plan payout at73.2% of targetAchieved Fiscal 2020 Non-GAAPOperating Income of $3.73 billion,resulting in 98.6% of target SY PSUsbecoming eligible to vestAchieved 3-year TSR of 138% (95thpercentile of S&P 500), resulting inmaximum number of MY PSUsbecoming eligible to vest(1) For achievement between Threshold and Base Operating Plan (or Target for MY PSUs) and between Base Operating Plan (or Target for MY PSUs)and Stretch Operating Plan (or Stretch for MY PSUs), payouts would be determined using straight-line interpolation.  Achievement less than Thresholdwould result in no payout, and exceeding Stretch Operating Plan (or Stretch for MY PSUs) would result in the capped maximum payout.* See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in our CD&A for a reconciliation between the non-GAAP measures and GAAP results.Ratification of the Selection of PwC as our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for Fiscal 2021 (Proposal 3)Although not required, we are asking our stockholders to ratify the AC’s selection of PwC as our independent registeredpublic accounting firm for Fiscal 2021 because we believe it is a matter of good corporate practice.  If our stockholders donot ratify the selection, the AC will reconsider the appointment, but may nevertheless retain PwC. Even if the selection isratified, the AC may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time if it determines that sucha change would be in the best interests of NVIDIA and our stockholders.Approval of an Amendment and Restatement of our 2007 Plan (Proposal 4)We are asking our stockholders to approve an amendment and restatement of our 2007 Plan primarily to increase theshare reserve by 14,800,000 shares; to remove a minimum 12-month vesting requirement from the date of grant on awardsunder the Proposed 2007 Plan; to prohibit paying dividends on unvested awards; and to extend the term of the 2007 Planto April 2030, which would otherwise expire in March 2022. The Board recommends a vote FOR this proposal because equityawards are an important component of our compensation program and the continued ability to issue these awards isessential to attracting, retaining and motivating our employees.Approval of an Amendment and Restatement of our 2012 ESPP (Proposal 5)We are asking our stockholders to approve an amendment and restatement of our 2012 ESPP to increase the share reserveby 2,000,000 shares. The Board recommends a vote FOR this proposal because our employee stock purchase program isan important employee benefit and is essential to attracting, retaining and motivating our employees.4NVIDIA CORPORATION2788 SAN TOMAS EXPRESSWAYSANTA CLARA, CALIFORNIA 95051(408) 486-2000  ____________________________________________________PROXY STATEMENT FOR THE 2020 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS - JUNE 9, 2020  ____________________________________________________5INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETINGYour proxy is being solicited for use at the 2020 Meeting on behalf of the Board.

The committee is committed to Board diversity and shall consider a nominee’sbackground and experience to ensure that a broad range of perspectives is represented on the Board.  The NCGC mayconduct any appropriate and necessary inquiries into the backgrounds and qualifications of possible candidates. The NCGCmay also engage a professional search firm to identify and assist the NCGC in identifying, evaluating, and conducting duediligence on potential director nominees. The NCGC has not established specific age, gender, education, experience, or skillrequirements for potential members, and instead considers numerous factors regarding the nominee taking into accountour current and future business models, including the following: •Integrity and candor•Independence•Senior management and operational experience•Professional, technical and industry knowledge•Financial expertise•Financial community experience (including as an investor inother companies)•Marketing and brand management•Public company board experience•Experience with emerging technologies and new businessmodels•Legal expertise•Diversity, including gender and ethnic background•Experience in academia•Willingness and ability to devote substantial time and effort toBoard responsibilities and Company oversight•Ability to represent the interests of the stockholders as awhole rather than special interest groups or constituencies•All relationships between the proposed nominee and any ofour stockholders, competitors, customers, suppliers or otherpersons with a relationship to NVIDIA•Overall service to NVIDIA, including past attendance at Boardand committee meetings and participation and contributions tothe activities of the BoardThe NCGC and the Board understand the importance of Board refreshment, and strive to maintain an appropriate balanceof tenure, diversity, professional experience and backgrounds, skills, and education on the Board.  While the Board benefitsfrom the experience and institutional knowledge that our longer-serving directors bring, it has also brought in newperspectives and ideas by appointing three new directors in the last five years.  Our longer-tenured directors are familiarwith our operations and business areas and have the perspective of overseeing our activities from a variety of economicand competitive environments.  Our newer directors bring expertise in consumer marketing, branding, technologydevelopments at leading academic institutions, and deep knowledge from decades of advising numerous companies thatare important to supporting NVIDIA as it competes in new markets and as it faces new regulatory and legal challenges.Each year, the NCGC and Board review each director’s individual performance, including the director’s past contributions,outside experiences and activities, and committee participation, and make a determination concerning how his or herexperience and skills continue to add value to NVIDIA and the Board.The following chart summarizes the skills and competencies of each director nominee that led our Board to conclude thathe or she is qualified to serve on our Board. The lack of a check does not mean the director lacks that skill or qualification;rather, a check indicates a specific area of focus or expertise for which the Board relies on such director nominee most.SeniorManagementand Operationsprovidesexperiencedoversight of ourbusiness andwith newinsightsIndustry andTechnicalfacilitates anunderstanding ofinnovations and atechnicalassessment of ourproducts andservicesFinancial/FinancialCommunityassists with review ofour operations andfinancial matters;those with a venturecapital backgroundoffer shareholderperspectivesPublicCompanyBoardhelps identifychallengesand risks weface as apubliccompanyEmergingTechnologiesand BusinessModelsintegral to ourgrowthstrategies givenour uniquebusiness modelMarketing andBrandManagementoffers guidanceon ourproductsdirectlymarketed toconsumersLegalimportant aswe are subjectto multiplelawsuits,regulatorymatters, andnewregulationsBurgessüüüüCoxeüüüDrellüHuangüüüüüHudsonüüüüJonesüüüüüMcCafferyüüüNealüüüPerryüüüüSeawellüüüüStevensüüüü9The NCGC evaluates candidates proposed by stockholders using the same criteria as it uses for other candidates.Stockholders seeking to recommend a prospective nominee should follow the instructions under StockholderCommunications with the Board of Directors below.

After considering all relevant relationships andtransactions, our Board determined that all of our directors are “independent” as defined by Nasdaq’s rules and regulations,except for Mr. Huang. The Board also determined that all members of our AC, CC and NCGC are independent under applicableNasdaq listing standards.  In addition, Messrs. McCaffery and Perry and Ms. Hudson of the AC are “audit committee financialexperts” based on SEC rules.Board Leadership StructureOur Board believes that all of its members should have an equal voice in the affairs and the management of NVIDIA, andtherefore, our stockholders are best served at this time by having an independent Lead Director, who is an integral part ofour Board structure and a critical aspect of our effective corporate governance, rather than having a chairperson. Theindependent directors consider the role and designation of the Lead Director on an annual basis, and Mr. Perry was appointedas our Lead Director in 2018. In addition, Mr. Perry serves on both the NCGC and the AC, which affords him increasedengagement with Board governance and composition as well as with risk assessment and management, and financial andregulatory matters of the Company. While the CEO has primary responsibility for preparing the agendas for Board meetingsand presiding over the portion of the meetings of the Board where he is present, our Lead Director has significantresponsibilities, which are set forth in our Corporate Governance Policies, and include, in part:•Determining an appropriate schedule of Board meetings, and seeking to ensure that the independent members ofthe Board can perform their duties responsibly while not interfering with the flow of our operations;•Working with the CEO, and seeking input from all directors and other relevant management, as to the preparationof the agendas for Board meetings;•Advising the CEO on a regular basis as to the quality, quantity and timeliness of the flow of information requestedby the Board from our management with the goal of providing what is necessary for the independent members ofthe Board to effectively and responsibly perform their duties, and, although our management is responsible forthe preparation of materials for the Board, the Lead Director may specifically request the inclusion of certainmaterial; and•Coordinating, developing the agenda for, and moderating executive sessions of the independent members of theBoard, and acting as principal liaison between them and the CEO on sensitive issues.The active involvement of our independent directors, combined with the qualifications and significant responsibilities ofour Lead Director, provide balance on the Board and promote strong, independent oversight of our management and affairs.Role of the Board in Risk OversightThe Board is responsible for overseeing risk management at NVIDIA and delegates oversight of appropriate topics to itscommittees. Our AC has the responsibility to consider and discuss our major financial risk exposures and the steps ourmanagement has taken to monitor and control these exposures. The AC also monitors compliance with certain legal andregulatory requirements and oversees the performance of our internal audit function.  Our NCGC monitors the effectivenessof our anonymous tip process and corporate governance guidelines, including whether they are successful in preventingillegal or improper liability-creating conduct, and oversees environmental, social and corporate governance risks, rangingfrom artificial intelligence to diversity and inclusion. Our CC assesses and monitors whether any of our compensationpolicies and programs has the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking. The Board exercises direct oversight of strategicrisks to NVIDIA and other risk areas not delegated to one of its committees, including business continuity and cybersecurity.Management periodically provides information, including guidance on risk management and mitigation, to the Board or arelevant committee. Each committee also reports to the Board on those matters.Corporate Governance Policies of the Board of DirectorsThe Board has documented our governance practices by adopting Corporate Governance Policies to ensure that the Boardhas the necessary authority and processes in place to review and evaluate our business operations as needed and to makedecisions that are independent of our management. Our Corporate Governance Policies set forth the practices the Boardfollows with respect to board composition and selection, regular evaluations of the Board and its committees, board meetingsand involvement of senior management, chief executive officer performance evaluation, and board committees andcompensation. Our Corporate Governance Policies may be viewed under Governance in the Investor Relations section ofour website at www.nvidia.com.Executive Sessions of the BoardAs required under Nasdaq’s listing standards, our independent directors have in the past met, and will continue to meet,regularly in scheduled executive sessions at which only independent directors are present. In Fiscal 2020, our independentdirectors met in executive session at all four of our scheduled quarterly Board meetings.In addition, independent directors have in the past met, and will continue to meet, regularly in scheduled executive sessionswith our CEO. In Fiscal 2020, our independent directors met in executive session with the CEO at all four of our scheduledquarterly Board meetings.Director Attendance at Annual MeetingWe do not have a formal policy regarding attendance by members of the Board at our annual meetings. We generallyschedule a Board meeting in conjunction with our annual meeting and expect that all of our directors will attend each annualmeeting, absent a valid reason.  All of our Board members attended our 2019 Meeting.Board Self-AssessmentsIn Fiscal 2020, the NCGC oversaw an evaluation process, conducted at least annually, whereby outside corporate counselfor NVIDIA interviewed each director to obtain his or her evaluation of the Board as a whole, and of the committees on whichhe or she serves. The interviews solicited ideas from the directors about, among other things, improving the quality of Boardand/or committee oversight effectiveness regarding strategic direction, financial and audit matters, executive compensationand other key matters.  The interviews also focused on Board process and identifying specific issues which should bediscussed in the future.  After these evaluations were complete, our outside corporate counsel summarized the results,reviewed with our Lead Director, and then submitted the summary for discussion by the NCGC. In response to the evaluations conducted in Fiscal 2020, our Board determined to strengthen oversight of the Company’soverall financial outlook process by the AC and the full Board, and to continue to prioritize its focus on the overall strengthand competence of the Board and the diversity of experience, gender and ethnic background of its members.Director Orientation and Continuing EducationThe NCGC and our General Counsel are responsible for director orientation programs and for director continuing educationprograms. Continuing education programs for directors may include a combination of internally developed materials andpresentations, programs presented by third parties, and financial and administrative support for attendance at qualifyingacademic or other independent programs. Director Stock Ownership GuidelinesThe Board believes that directors should hold a significant equity interest in NVIDIA. Our Corporate Governance Policiesrequire each non-employee director to hold a number of shares of our common stock with a value equal to six times theannual cash retainer for Board service during the period in which he or she serves as a director (or six times the basesalary, in the case of the CEO).  The shares may include vested deferred stock, shares held in trust and shares held byimmediate family members. Non-employee directors have five years after their Board appointment to reach the ownershipthreshold.  Our stock ownership guidelines are intended to further align director interests with stockholder interests.Each of our non-employee directors and Mr. Huang currently meets or exceeds the stock ownership requirements, with theexception of Mr. Neal, who joined our Board in 2019.Hedging and Pledging Policy Under our Insider Trading Policy, our directors, executive officers, employees, and their designees may not hedge theirownership of NVIDIA stock, including but not limited to trading in options, puts, calls, or other derivative instruments relatedto NVIDIA stock or debt to protect against a decline in the value of the Company’s stock. Additionally, directors, executive16officers and employees may not purchase NVIDIA stock on margin, borrow against NVIDIA stock held in a margin account,or pledge NVIDIA stock as collateral for a loan.  We allow for certain portfolio diversification transactions, such as investmentsin exchange funds.Outside AdvisorsThe Board and each of its principal committees may retain outside advisors and consultants of their choosing at our expense.The Board need not obtain management’s consent to retain outside advisors. In addition, the principal committees neednot obtain either the Board’s or management’s consent to retain outside advisors.Code of ConductWe expect our directors, executives and employees to conduct themselves with the highest degree of integrity, ethics andhonesty. Our credibility and reputation depend upon the good judgment, ethical standards and personal integrity of eachdirector, executive and employee. We have a Code of Conduct that applies to our executive officers, directors and employees,including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. We also have a FinancialTeam Code of Conduct that applies to our executive officers, directors and members of our finance department. We regularlyreview our Code of Conduct and related policies to ensure that they provide clear guidance to our directors, executives andemployees.The Code of Conduct and the Financial Team Code of Conduct are available under Governance in the Investor Relationssection of our website at www.nvidia.com.

Teter, our Secretary, at NVIDIA Corporation, 2788 San TomasExpressway, Santa Clara, California 95051. All stockholder communications we receive that are addressed to the Board willbe compiled by our Secretary. If no particular director is named, letters will be forwarded, depending on the subject matter,to the chairperson of the AC, CC or NCGC.  Matters put forth by our stockholders will be reviewed by the NCGC, which willdetermine whether these matters should be presented to the Board. The NCGC will give serious consideration to all suchmatters and will make its determination in accordance with its charter and applicable laws.Majority Vote StandardUnder our Bylaws, if the votes cast FOR an incumbent director in a non-contested election do not exceed the number ofWITHHOLD votes, such incumbent director shall promptly tender a resignation to the Board. The NCGC will then review thecircumstances surrounding the WITHHOLD vote and promptly make a recommendation to the Board on whether to acceptor reject the resignation or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the NCGC’s recommendation andpublicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date of certification of the stockholder vote.In a contested election, in which the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected, our directors willbe elected by a plurality of the shares represented at any such meeting or by proxy and entitled to vote on the election ofdirectors at that meeting.  The directors receiving the greatest number of FOR votes will be elected.Board Meeting InformationThe Board met seven times during Fiscal 2020,  including meetings during which the Board discussed the strategic directionof NVIDIA, explored and discussed new business and strategic opportunities and the product roadmap, and other mattersfacing NVIDIA.  We expect each Board member to attend each meeting of the Board and the committees on which he or sheserves. Each Board member attended 75% or more of the meetings of the Board and of each committee on which he orshe served.Committees of the Board of DirectorsThe Board has three standing committees: an AC, a CC and a NCGC. Each of these committees operates under a writtencharter, which may be viewed under Governance in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.nvidia.com.  The composition and functions of our committees are set forth below.  Committee assignments are determined based onbackground and the expertise which individual directors can bring to a committee.  Our Board believes that rotations amongcommittees are a good corporate governance practice which allows its members to be more fully informed regarding thefull scope of the Board and our activities, and benefits each committee and the Board as a whole, as a result of diverseperspectives and ideas that are introduced through new committee formations.  In February 2020, upon the recommendationof the NCGC, the Board determined to rotate Mr. Seawell off of the CC and onto the AC, effective as of the 2020 Meeting. ACMichael G.

Following this review, the CC recommended no changes to our non-employee director compensation programfor the year starting on the date of our 2019 Meeting, which we refer to as the 2019 Program.The CC subsequently recommended, and the Board approved, a mix of cash and equity awards with an approximate annualvalue of $300,000, which was slightly below the median total annual compensation paid by similarly-sized technology peercompanies to their non-employee directors. We do not pay additional fees for serving as a chairperson or member of Boardcommittees or for meeting attendance. Directors who are also employees do not receive fees or equity compensation forservice on the Board. Cash Compensation The cash portion of the annual retainer, representing $75,000 on an annualized basis, was paid quarterly.  Mr. Neal waspaid the pro-rata portion of the annual cash retainer for his service on the Board from the date of his appointment in March2019 to the date of our 2019 Meeting.Equity CompensationThe value of the annual equity award, in the form of RSUs, or the 2019 Program RSUs, was $225,000.

The RSUs were granted on the first trading day followingthe date of our 2019 Meeting.To correlate the vesting of the RSUs to the non-employee directors’ service on the Board and its committees over thefollowing year, the RSUs vested as to 50% on November 20, 2019 (the third Wednesday in November 2019) and will vest asto the remaining 50% on May 20, 2020 (the third Wednesday in May 2020).  If a non-employee director’s service terminatesdue to death, his or her RSU grants will immediately vest in full for the benefit of his or her beneficiary.  Non-employeedirectors do not receive dividend equivalents on unvested RSUs.In connection with Mr. Neal’s appointment to the Board in March 2019, he was granted on April 8, 2019: (a) an initial RSUgrant with a value of $225,000, which vests as to 1/6th of the shares approximately every six months, or the Initial NealRSUs, and (b) the pro-rata portion of the annual RSUs for his service on the Board from the date of his appointment in March2019 to the date of our 2019 Meeting, which vested in full on May 15, 2019, or the 2018 Program Neal RSUs.  If Mr. Neal’sservice terminates due to death, his RSU grants will immediately fully vest. He does not receive dividend equivalents onunvested RSUs.Deferral of SettlementNon-employee directors could elect to defer settlement of RSUs upon vesting, to be issued on the earliest of (a) the date ofthe director’s “separation from service” (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)), unless a six monthdelay would be required under such Section, (b) the date of a change in control of NVIDIA that also would constitute a “changein control event” (as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5)), and (c) the third Wednesday in March of theyear elected by the director, which year must have been or be no earlier than (i) 2020 for the 2018 Program Neal RSUs, (ii)2021 for the 2019 Program RSUs, or (iii) 2023 for the Initial Neal RSUs.  Messrs. Gaither, Jones, McCaffery, and Neal, Dr.Drell, and Ms. Hudson elected to defer settlement of the RSUs granted to them in Fiscal 2020.Other Compensation/BenefitsOur non-employee directors are reimbursed for expenses incurred in attending Board and committee meetings andcontinuing educational programs pursuant to our Corporate Governance Policies.

A non-binding vote, known as “say-on-pay,” to approve our Fiscal 2020 NEO compensation.Vote required:  A majority of the shares present or represented by proxy.Effect of abstentions:  Same as a vote AGAINST.Effect of broker non-votes:  None.In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking our stockholders to vote on an advisory basis, commonlyreferred to as “say-on-pay”, to approve the compensation paid to our NEOs as disclosed in the CD&A, the compensationtables and the related narrative disclosure contained in this proxy statement. In response to our stockholders’ preference,our Board has adopted a policy of providing for annual “say-on-pay” votes. This vote is not intended to address any specificitem of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and the philosophy, policies and practices describedin this proxy statement.This advisory proposal is not binding on the Board or us. Nevertheless, the views expressed by the stockholders, whetherthrough this vote or otherwise, are important to management and the Board and, accordingly, the Board and the CC intendto consider the results of this vote in making determinations in the future regarding NEO compensation arrangements.Recommendation of the BoardThe Board recommends that our stockholders adopt the following resolution:“RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company’s named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 ofRegulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion ishereby APPROVED.”24Executive Compensation25Compensation Discussion and AnalysisThis CD&A describes our Fiscal 2020 executive compensation goals, philosophies and program design, including the CC’sprocess for determining compensation, the various components of pay, and how our corporate results affected performance-based payout.

TeterExecutive Vice President, General Counsel and SecretaryThe CC will consider the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s Fiscal 2021 business and financial results in evaluatingexecutive compensation, and any resulting decisions will be described in the proxy statement for the 2021 Meeting.Executive SummaryExecutive Compensation Goals and PhilosophiesNVIDIA’s mission is to develop revolutionary technology that improves lives.  To achieve this vision, we must attract, motivateand retain a high-caliber executive team while balancing our stockholders’ interests.  While our CC considers numerousfactors in making executive pay decisions, our compensation program is guided by the following goals and philosophies:•Pay for Performance:  emphasize at-risk and performance-based cash and equity for NEOs based on multiplecorporate metrics.•Motivation and Retention:  NEO target compensation should be competitive with our peers; reflects job impact,scope, and responsibilities; and is structured to retain talent.•Stockholder Alignment:  structure NEO pay to align with stockholders’ long-term interests and make adjustmentsin response to feedback received through our annual stockholder engagement and our annual “say-on-pay” vote.•Simplicity and Transparency:  utilize clear, simple performance metrics that are defined and reported publicly.Fiscal 2020 Executive Compensation Program DesignTaking into account (i) the Company’s Fiscal 2020 outlook at the time of determining executive compensation, (ii) stockholderfeedback from our annual outreach efforts, and (iii) strong Fiscal 2019 say-on-pay approval, the CC determined to keeptarget pay essentially flat with Fiscal 2019.

A significant portion of ourexecutive pay opportunities are tied to achievement of rigorous financial measures that drive business value and contributeto our long-term success.  The tables below show our goals and achievement for each of these measures for the applicableperiod ended Fiscal 2020, and their respective impact on our executive pay:RevenueNon-GAAP Operating Income*3-Year TSRPerformanceGoalPayout as a % ofTargetOpportunity(1)PerformanceGoalShares Eligible to Vestas a % of Target Opportunity(1)PerformanceGoalShares Eligible to Vestas a % of Target Opportunity(1)Threshold$10.5 billion50%$3.21 billion50%25thpercentile25%Base Operating Plan(Target for MY PSUs)$11.4 billion100%$3.75 billion100%50thpercentile100%Stretch Operating Plan(Stretch for MY PSUs)$12.0 billion200%$4.23 billion150% for CEO; 200% forour other NEOs75thpercentile150% for CEO; 200% forour other NEOsPerformance andPayoutAchieved Fiscal 2020 revenue of$10.92 billion, resulting in aVariable Cash Plan payout at73.2% of targetAchieved Fiscal 2020 Non-GAAPOperating Income of $3.73 billion,resulting in 98.6% of target SY PSUsbecoming eligible to vestAchieved 3-year TSR of 138% (95thpercentile of S&P 500), resulting inmaximum number of MY PSUsbecoming eligible to vest(1)For achievement between Threshold and Base Operating Plan (or Target for MY PSUs) and between Base Operating Plan (or Target for MY PSUs)and Stretch Operating Plan (or Stretch for MY PSUs), payouts would be determined using straight-line interpolation.

Feedback fromconversations with our stockholders is further described in Compensation Actions and Achievements below.Roles of the CC, Compensation Consultant and ManagementOur CC solicits the input of Mr. Huang and the CC’s independent compensation consultant, Exequity, which reports directlyto our CC.  The roles of our CC, Exequity, and management, including our CEO, CFO, and Human Resources and Legaldepartments, in setting our Fiscal 2020 NEO compensation program are summarized below.At the CC’s direction, Exequity and management recommended a peer group for our program, which was approved by theCC.  Management then gathered peer data from the Radford Global Technology Survey, which was considered by Exequityin its analysis of Mr. Huang’s compensation, and by Mr. Huang in his recommendations on our other NEOs’ compensation,for Fiscal 2020.  The CC considered Exequity’s advice, Mr. Huang’s recommendations, and management’s proposed Fiscal2020 performance goals prior to making its final and sole decision on all Fiscal 2020 NEO compensation.  Additionally,Exequity advised the CC on the Fiscal 2020 compensation risk analysis prepared by management.  The CC also certifiedperformance-based Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2020 compensation payouts.  During Fiscal 2020, our CC continued to use Exequity for its experience working with our CC and with compensationcommittees at other technology companies.  Our CC analyzed whether Exequity’s role raised any conflict of interest,considering:  (i) Exequity does not provide any services directly to NVIDIA (although we pay Exequity on the CC’s behalf), (ii)the percentage of Exequity’s total revenue resulting from fees paid by us on the CC’s behalf, (iii) Exequity’s conflict of interestpolicies and procedures, (iv) any business or personal relationship between Exequity and an NEO, or between Exequity’sindividual compensation advisors and an NEO or any member of our CC, and (v) any NVIDIA stock owned by Exequity or itsindividual compensation advisors.  After considering these factors, our CC determined that Exequity’s work did not createany conflict of interest.Peer Companies and Market Compensation DataWe believe our peers should be companies that (1) compete with us for executive talent; (2) have established businesses,market presence, and complexity similar to us; and (3) are generally of similar size to us, as measured by revenue and/ormarket capitalization at roughly 0.5-3.5x of us.  Accordingly, we made significant updates to our peer group for Fiscal 2020:Fiscal 2020 Peer Group (1)Adobe Inc.Cisco Systems, Inc. (2)Intuit Inc.Qualcomm IncorporatedTesla, Inc.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.IBM (2)Oracle Corporation (2)Salesforce.com, Inc.Texas InstrumentsBroadcom LimitedIntel Corporation (2)PayPal (2)SAP (2)VMware, Inc.(1) Activision Blizzard, Analog Devices, Applied Materials, eBay, Electronic Arts, Lam Research, Micron Technology, Symantec, and Western Digital, eacha Fiscal 2019 peer, were removed for Fiscal 2020 because their respective market capitalizations fell below our targeted range and/or for lack ofcompetition for talent.(2) Added as a Fiscal 2020 peer for similar market capitalization to us.The CC determined our Fiscal 2020 peer group in December 2018.  At that time, our revenue and market capitalizationcompared to our peer group companies as follows:RevenueMarket CapitalizationFiscal 2020 Peer Group Median$14.97 billion$100.18 billionNVIDIA$9.71 billion$96.10 billionOur CC reviews market practices and compensation data from the Radford survey for peer companies’ comparably situatedexecutives when determining the components of our executive compensation program as well as total compensation.  TheCC compares the total compensation opportunity for our NEOs and similarly situated executives at the 50th and 75thpercentiles of peer company data, and also considers the factors below in determining NEO compensation opportunities.27Factors Used in Determining Executive CompensationIn addition to peer data, our CC considers the following factors in making executive compensation decisions. The weightgiven to each factor may differ among NEOs and each component of pay, and is subject to the CC’s sole discretion.ü The need to attract and retain talent in a highlycompetitive industryü Stockholder feedback regarding our executive payü The simplicity of the overall program and thetransparency of the performance metricsü An NEO’s past performance and anticipated futurecontributionsü Our financial performance and forecasted resultsü The need to motivate NEOs to address new businesschallengesü Each NEO’s current total compensationü Each NEO’s unvested equityü Internal pay equity relative to similarly situatedexecutives and the scope and complexity of thedepartment or function the NEO manages ü Our CEO’s recommendations for the other NEOs,including his understanding of each NEO’s performance,capabilities, contributionsü Our CC’s independent judgmentü Our philosophy that an NEO’s total compensationopportunity and percentage of at-risk pay should increasewith responsibilityü The total compensation cost and stockholder dilutionfrom executive compensation, to maintain a responsiblecost structure for our compensation programs**    See Note 4, Stock-Based Compensation of our Form 10-K consolidated financial statements for a discussion of stock-based compensation cost.28Components of PayThe primary components of NVIDIA’s Fiscal 2020 executive compensation program are summarized below:FixedCompensationAt-Risk CompensationBase SalaryVariable CashSY PSUsMY PSUsRSUs*FormCashCashEquityEquityEquityWhoReceivesNEOsNEOsNEOsNEOsNEOs except Mr. HuangWhenGranted orDeterminedAnnually inFiscal Q1Annually inFiscal Q1On the 6th business day ofMarch (March 8, 2019)On the 6th business day ofMarch (March 8, 2019)On the 6th business dayof March (March 8, 2019)When Paid,Earned, orIssuedRetroactivelypaid to start offiscal year, viabiweeklypayrollIf at leastThresholdgoal achieved,earned afterfiscal yearend, paid inMarchShares eligible to vestdetermined after fiscal year endbased on performance achieved;if at least Threshold achieved,issued on each vesting date,subject to the NEO’s continuedservice on each such dateShares eligible to vestdetermined after 3rd fiscal yearend based on performanceachieved; if at least Thresholdachieved, issued on the solevesting date, subject to the NEO’scontinued service on such dateIssued on each vestingdate, subject to theNEO’s continued serviceon each such datePerformanceMeasureN/ARevenue(determinescash payout)Non-GAAP Operating Income(determines number of shareseligible to vest)TSR relative to the S&P 500(determines number of shareseligible to vest)N/APerformancePeriodN/A1 year1 year3 yearsN/AVestingPeriodN/AN/A4 years from grant3 years from grant4 years from grantVestingTermsN/AN/AIf at least Threshold achieved,25% on approximately the 1-yearanniversary of the grant date;6.25% quarterly thereafterIf at least Threshold achieved,100% on approximately the 3-year anniversary of the grantdate25% on approximatelythe 1-year anniversaryof the grant date; 6.25%quarterly thereafterTimeframeEmphasizedAnnualAnnualLong-termLong-termLong-termMaximumAmount ThatCan BeEarnedN/A200% oftarget awardopportunityunder ourVariable CashPlan150% of Mr. Huang’s SY PSUtarget opportunity and 200% ofour other NEOs’ respective SYPSU target opportunityUltimate value delivereddepends on stock price on dateearned shares vest150% of Mr. Huang’s MY PSUtarget opportunity and 200% ofour other NEOs’ respective MYPSU target opportunityUltimate value delivereddepends on stock price on dateearned shares vest100% of grantUltimate value delivereddepends on stock priceon date shares vest* Our CC considers RSUs to be at-risk pay because the realized value depends on our stock price, which is a financial performance measure.In addition, we maintain medical, vision, dental, and accidental death and disability insurance as well as time off and paidholidays for all of our NEOs, on the same basis as our other employees.  Like our other full-time employees, our NEOs areeligible to participate in our 2012 ESPP, unless otherwise prohibited by the rules of the Internal Revenue Service, and our401(k) plan, which included a Company match of salary deferral contributions of up to $6,000 for calendar 2019 and up to$6,500 for calendar 2020.  For Fiscal 2020, Mr. Puri, Mr. Teter and Ms. Kress each received a $6,500 401(k) match, while ourother NEOs each received a $6,000 401(k) match. 29Compensation Actions and AchievementsStockholder Outreach and FeedbackWe value stockholder feedback and conduct an annual stockholder outreach program.  During the Fall of 2018, in preparingfor Fiscal 2020 compensation decisions, we contacted our top 14 institutional stockholders (except for brokerage firms andindex funds who we know do not engage in direct conversations with companies), with an aggregate ownership ofapproximately 27% of our shares.  Our Lead Director and members of management ultimately discussed executivecompensation with representatives of stockholders holding an aggregate of approximately 26% of our common stock. Ourstockholders generally provided positive feedback on our pay for performance alignment and the proportion of variableversus fixed pay.  While some stockholders encouraged our use of TSR as a relative performance figure and its tie to atransparent index, others expressed reservations about TSR due to NVIDIA’s lack of control over stock price. After considering their feedback, and our Fiscal 2019 say-on-pay approval rate of 96%, our CC concluded that the use ofour multi-year relative TSR performance metric continued to, in combination with our annual performance metrics ofrevenue and Non-GAAP Operating Income, effectively align executive compensation with stockholder interests.  Therefore,the CC maintained the same general elements and metrics for our Fiscal 2020 NEO pay program, but adjusted the corporategoals to appropriately motivate our executives, as further described below.  In the Fall of 2019, our management and LeadDirector again engaged in stockholder outreach.  The CC considered the feedback from these meetings in making decisionsregarding the current Fiscal 2021 executive compensation program.Total Target Compensation ApproachIn deciding Fiscal 2020 compensation, our CC reviewed each NEO’s total target pay opportunity and distribution acrossdifferent pay elements.  Our CC compared Mr. Huang’s base salary, target variable cash opportunity, target equity opportunity,and total target pay against chief executives of our peer companies.  For our other NEOs, our CC reviewed their respectivetotal target pay against similarly situated executives of our peer companies.  The CC also considered the factors discussedabove in Factors Used in Determining Executive Compensation and the CC’s specific compensation objectives for Fiscal 2020.Our CC did not use a single formula or assign a specific weight to any one factor in determining each NEO’s target pay.Rather, our CC used its business judgment and experience to set total target compensation, mix of cash and equity, andfixed and at-risk pay opportunities for each NEO to achieve our program’s objectives.  When the CC set each element of payfor an NEO, it considered the context of the levels of the other pay elements, and the resulting total target pay for such NEO.These amounts and structure allowed our NEOs to realize above-market value from equity awards and variable cashincentives only upon exceptional corporate performance.  After also considering the Company’s forecast of flat to slightlydown revenue for Fiscal 2020, the CC ultimately kept our NEOs’ target pay essentially flat with Fiscal 2019.  There were noincreases to base salaries or variable cash targets and only very minor adjustments to target equity values.Continued Emphasis on Long-Term, At-Risk, Performance-Based Equity AwardsFor Fiscal 2020, the CC decided that the largest portion of NEOs’ total target pay would again be in the form of at-risk,performance-based equity.  The CC believes an emphasis on long-term, at-risk opportunities drives results and increasesNEO and stockholder alignment, while providing sufficient annual cash compensation to be competitive and retain our NEOs.The PSUs and RSUs provide long-term incentives and retention benefits because our NEOs must achieve, for PSUs, thepredetermined performance goal and also, for both PSUs and RSUs, remain with us for a multi-year period (3 years for MYPSUs and 4 years for SY PSUs and RSUs) to fully vest in the awards.The CC concluded that, given Mr. Huang’s position as CEO, 100% of his equity grants should be at-risk and performance-based, tightly aligning his interests with stockholders.  Consistent with its practice over the last five years, the CC grantedMr. Huang’s target equity opportunity 100% in the form of SY PSUs (which value is aligned with our Non-GAAP OperatingIncome performance) and MY PSUs (which value is aligned with our relative stock price performance).  For our other NEOs,the CC provided roughly 65% of the target equity opportunity in the form of PSUs and 35% of the target equity opportunityin the form of RSUs, subject to individual adjustments determined appropriate by the CC.  The CC evaluated marketpositioning, internal pay equity, individual performance, and level of unvested equity to determine a target equity opportunityvalue for our NEOs, which was set substantially equivalently to the target equity values for Fiscal 2019.  To determine actualshares awarded, the CC used the 120-day trailing average of our stock price, reducing the impact of daily volatility oncompensation decisions.  This average determined the number of RSUs and the target number of SY PSUs and MY PSUs. The target numbers of SY PSU and MY PSU shares were eligible to vest upon our achievement of the Base Operating PlanNon-GAAP Operating Income performance goal for Fiscal 2020, and the Target TSR performance goal relative to the S&P500 over a 3-year period starting at the beginning of Fiscal 2020, respectively.  No shares were eligible to vest if at leastThreshold performance was not achieved.   Shares underlying any PSUs that are not earned are cancelled.If the Company achieved at least Threshold performance, the minimum number of shares eligible to vest was 50% of theSY PSU target opportunity and 25% of the MY PSU target opportunity.  If the Company achieved at least Stretch OperatingPlan performance for SY PSUs (or Stretch performance for MY PSUs), the maximum number of shares eligible to vest wascapped at 150% of Mr. Huang’s, and 200% of our other NEOs’ respective, PSU target opportunities.  Goals for and Achievement of Performance-Based CompensationBased on the Fiscal 2020 strategic plan as approved by the Board, the CC set performance metrics and goals, and theCompany achieved certain performance and paid out to our NEOs, as set forth below:Variable Cash PlanSY PSUsMY PSUsPERFORMANCE METRICSMetricRevenueNon-GAAP Operating Income*TSR relative to the S&P 500Timeframe1 year1 year3 yearsCC’s Rationale for MetricAnnual performance indicatorwhich drives value, contributes toCompany’s long-term successOur executives focus on growth inthe Company's specializedmarkets where our technologiesdid not previously exist; revenuegrowth is a strong predictor ofthe Company's future successDistinct, separate metric fromNon-GAAP Operating IncomeAnnual performance indicatorwhich drives value, contributes toCompany’s long-term successReflects both our annual revenuegeneration and effective operatingexpense managementTo ensure long-term performanceemphasis, structured to vest overa 4-year periodAligns directly with long-termshareholder value creationProvides direct comparison of ourstock price performance (withdividends) against an index thatrepresents a broader capitalmarket with which we competeRelative (versus absolute) natureof goals accounts formacroeconomic factors impactingthe broader marketPERFORMANCE LEVELSPerformanceGoalPayout as a %of TargetOpportunity(1)Performance GoalShares Eligibleto Vest as a %of TargetOpportunity(1)PerformanceGoalShares Eligibleto Vest as a %of TargetOpportunity(1)Threshold$10.5 billion50%$3.21 billion50%25th percentile25%Appropriately deceleratedpayout for performance belowBase Operating Plan (Target forMY PSUs); uncertain, butattainable and high enough tocreate modest valueBase Operating Plan (Target for MY PSUs)$11.4 billion100%$3.75 billion100%50th percentile100%Uncertain, but attainable withsignificant effort and executionsuccess.

The remainingshares that were ineligible to vestwere cancelled in February 2020.Achieved 3-year TSR endingFiscal 2020 of 138% (95thpercentile of S&P 500), resultingin maximum number of MY PSUsbecoming eligible to vest.  100%of the eligible MY PSUs vested onMarch 18, 2020, after the 3-yearperformance period.(1)For achievement between Threshold and Base Operating Plan (or Target for MY PSUs) and between Base Operating Plan (or Target for MY PSUs) andStretch Operating Plan (or Stretch for MY PSUs), payouts would be determined using straight-line interpolation.  Achievement less than Thresholdwould result in no payout, and exceeding Stretch Operating Plan (or Stretch for MY PSUs) would result in the capped maximum payout.(2)Goals for Variable Cash Plan and SY PSUs were lower than in Fiscal 2019 to account for headwinds from excess channel inventory and hyperscalespending pause.* See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this CD&A for a reconciliation between the non-GAAP measures and GAAP results.Achievement of goals for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2020 MY PSU grants will be determined after January 2021 and January2022, respectively.Target Fiscal 2020 Compensation ActionsThe CC’s target Fiscal 2020 compensation actions are summarized below for each NEO, reflecting the target value of thevariable cash and equity opportunities the CC intended to deliver.

Our Corporate GovernancePolicies require the CEO to hold shares of our common stock valued at six times his base salary, and our other NEOs tohold shares of our common stock valued at the NEO’s respective base salary.  NEOs have up to five years from appointmentto reach the ownership threshold.  The stock ownership guidelines are intended to further align NEO interests withstockholder interests.  Each of our NEOs currently exceeds the stock ownership requirements. Compensation Recovery (“Clawback”) PolicyWe maintain a Compensation Recovery Policy for all employees.  Under this policy, if we are required to prepare an accountingrestatement to correct an accounting error on an interim or annual financial statement included in a report on Form 10-Qor Form 10-K due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the federal securities laws,or a Restatement, and if the Board or a committee of independent directors concludes that our CEO, our CFO or any otheremployee received a variable compensation payment that would not have been payable if the original interim or annualfinancial statements had reflected the Restatement, which we refer to as the Overpayment, then:•Our CEO and our CFO will disgorge the net after-tax portion of the Overpayment; and•The Board or the committee of independent directors in its sole discretion may require any other employee to repaythe Overpayment.  In using its discretion, the Board or the independent committee may consider whether suchperson was involved in the preparation of our financial statements or otherwise caused the need for the Restatementand may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, recoup amounts by (1) requiring partial or full repayment bysuch person of any variable or incentive compensation or any gains realized on the exercise of stock options or onthe open-market sale of vested shares, (2) canceling up to all and any outstanding equity awards held by suchperson and/or (3) adjusting the future compensation of such person.  We will review and update the Compensation Recovery Policy as necessary for compliance with the clawback policyprovisions of the Dodd Frank Act when the final regulations related to that policy are issued.Tax and Accounting ImplicationsUnder Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, or Section 162(m), compensation paid to any publicly-held corporation’s“covered employees” that exceeds $1 million per taxable year for any covered employee is generally non-deductible.  Priorto the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Section 162(m) provided an exception pursuant to which the deduction limitdid not apply to any compensation that qualified as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m).  With the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m)was repealed with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, except that certain transition relief isprovided for compensation paid pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on November 2, 2017, and whichis not modified in any material respect on or after such date.  As a result, compensation paid to any of our “covered employees” in excess of $1 million per taxable year generally will notbe deductible unless it qualifies for the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m) pursuant to thetransition relief described above.  Because of certain ambiguities and uncertainties as to the application and interpretationof Section 162(m), as well as other factors beyond the control of the CC, no assurance can be given that any compensationpaid by the Company will be eligible for such transition relief and be deductible by the Company in the future.  Although theCC will continue to consider tax implications as one factor in determining executive compensation, the CC also looks atother factors in making its decisions and retains the flexibility to provide compensation for our NEOs in a manner consistentwith the goals of our executive compensation program and the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, whichmay include providing for compensation that is not deductible by the Company due to the deduction limit under Section162(m). The CC also retains the flexibility to modify compensation that was initially intended to be exempt from the deductionlimit under Section 162(m) if it determines that such modifications are consistent with the Company’s business needs.Our CC also considers the impact of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, and in general, our executive plans andprograms are designed to comply with the requirements of that section to avoid the possible adverse tax consequencesthat may arise from non-compliance.33Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresA reconciliation between our Non-GAAP Operating Income and GAAP operating income is as follows (in millions):Fiscal 2020Fiscal 2019GAAP operating income$2,846$3,804Stock-based compensation expense844557Legal settlement costs1544Acquisition-related and other costs302Non-GAAP Operating Income$3,735$4,407We believe these non-GAAP financial measures enhance stockholders’ overall understanding of our historical financialperformance. The presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation nor as asubstitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different fromnon-GAAP measures used by other companies. 34Risk Analysis of Our Compensation PlansWith the oversight of the CC, members from the Company’s Legal, Human Resources and Finance departments, as well asExequity, the independent consultant engaged by the CC, performed an assessment of the Company’s compensationprograms and policies for Fiscal 2020 as generally applicable to our employees to ascertain any potential material risksthat may be created by our compensation programs.  The assessment focused on programs with variability of payout andthe ability of participants to directly affect payout and the controls over participant action and payout—specifically, theCompany’s variable cash compensation, equity compensation, and sales incentive compensation programs.  We identifiedthe key terms of these programs, potential concerns regarding risk taking behavior, and specific risk mitigation features.The assessment was first presented to our Senior Vice President, Human Resources; our CFO; and our General Counsel,and then presented to the CC.The CC considered the findings of the assessment described above and concluded that our compensation programs, whichare structured to recognize both short-term and long-term contributions to the Company, do not create risks which arereasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.  The CC believes that the following compensation design features guard against excessive risk-taking: Compensation Design Features that Guard Against Excessive Risk-TakingüOur compensation program encourages our employees to remain focused on both our short-term and long-term goalsüWe design our variable cash and PSU compensation programs for executives so that payouts are based onachievement of corporate performance targets, and we cap the potential award payoutüWe have internal controls over our financial accounting and reporting which is used to measure anddetermine the eligible compensation awards under our Variable Cash Plan and our SY PSUsüFinancial plan target goals and final awards under our Variable Cash Plan and our SY PSUs are approved bythe CC and consistent with the annual operating plan approved by the full Board each yearüMY PSUs are designed with a relative goalüWe have a compensation recovery policy applicable to all employees that allows NVIDIA to recovercompensation paid in situations of fraud or material financial misconductüAll executive officer equity awards have multi-year vestingüWe have stock ownership guidelines that we believe are reasonable and are designed to align our executiveofficers’ interests with those of our stockholdersüWe enforce a “no-hedging” policy and a “no-pledging” policy involving our common stock which prevents ouremployees from insulating themselves from the effects of NVIDIA stock price performanceSummary Compensation Table for Fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018The following table summarizes information regarding the compensation earned by our NEOs during Fiscal 2020, 2019,and 2018.

If the survivingcorporation does not assume, continue, or substitute such stock awards, then (a) with respect to any stock awards that areheld by individuals performing services for NVIDIA immediately prior to the effective time of the transaction, the vestingand exercisability provisions of such stock awards will be accelerated in full and such stock awards will be terminated ifnot exercised prior to the effective date of the corporate transaction or change-in-control, and (b) all other outstandingstock awards will be terminated if not exercised on or prior to the effective date of the corporate transaction or change-in-control.Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-ControlUpon a change-in-control or certain other corporate transactions of NVIDIA, unvested RSUs and PSUs will fully vest in somecases as described above under Employment, Severance and Change-in-Control Arrangements—Change-in-ControlArrangements.

Teter *————* Mr. Teter joined NVIDIA in January of 2017 and did not receive PSUs until Fiscal 2019.The actual number of MY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2019 that will become eligible to vest will be determinable after January 31, 2021, the ending dateof the three year measurement period for MY PSUs.The actual number of MY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2020 that will become eligible to vest will be determinable after January 30, 2022, the ending dateof the three year measurement period for MY PSUs.40Pay Ratio In accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, promulgated by the Dodd Frank Act, we determined the ratio of: (a) theannual total compensation of our CEO, to (b) the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, except forour CEO, both calculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K.We determined our median employee for purposes of the pay ratio calculation for Fiscal 2018 by using a consistently appliedcompensation measure which aggregated, for each employee employed by us on the last business day of Fiscal 2018, orJanuary 26, 2018: (i) target base salary as of January 26, 2018 (annualized for employees who were employed by us forless than the entire fiscal year), (ii) variable cash earned during Fiscal 2018, and (iii) aggregate full grant date fair value ofequity awards granted during Fiscal 2018, calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 and assuming the probableoutcome of the conditions at Base Operating Plan for performance-based awards.  Compensation paid in foreign currencieswas converted to U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect on January 26, 2018.After applying the methodology described above, we determined the identity of our median employee for Fiscal 2018.  Weconcluded that because there have been no changes to our employee population or employee compensation arrangementssince the end of Fiscal 2018 that would significantly impact our pay ratio disclosure for Fiscal 2020, we would use the sameindividual in our Fiscal 2020 pay ratio calculation.Our median employee’s compensation for Fiscal 2020 was $178,944.  Our CEO’s compensation for Fiscal 2020 was$11,492,280.  Therefore, our Fiscal 2020 CEO to median employee pay ratio was 64:1.This pay ratio represents our reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-Kand applicable guidance, which provide significant flexibility in how companies identify the median employee. Each companymay use a different methodology and make different assumptions. As a result, and as explained by the SEC when it adoptedthese rules, in considering the pay ratio disclosure, stockholders should keep in mind that the rule was not designed tofacilitate comparisons of pay ratios among different companies, even companies within the same industry, but rather toallow stockholders to better understand and assess each particular company’s compensation practices and pay ratiodisclosures. Neither the CC nor our management used our Fiscal 2020 CEO to median employee pay ratio in makingcompensation decisions.41Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider ParticipationFor Fiscal 2020, the CC consisted of Messrs. Burgess, Coxe, Jones, and Seawell and Dr. Drell.  No member of the CC is anofficer or employee of NVIDIA, and none of our executive officers serve as a director or member of a compensation committeeof any entity that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our Board or CC. Compensation Committee ReportThe Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the compensation programs of NVIDIA on behalf of theBoard of Directors. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed withmanagement the Compensation Discussion and Analysis included in this proxy statement.In reliance on the review and discussions referred to above, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board ofDirectors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of NVIDIA for theyear ended January 26, 2020 and in this proxy statement.Compensation CommitteeRobert K.

Our lead audit partner at PwC serves no more than five consecutive yearsin that role. Stockholder ratification of the AC’s selection of PwC is not required by our Bylaws or any other governingdocuments or laws. As a matter of good corporate governance, we are submitting the selection of PwC to our stockholdersfor ratification. If our stockholders do not ratify the selection, the AC will reconsider whether or not to retain PwC. Even ifthe selection is ratified, the AC in its sole discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered publicaccounting firm at any time during the fiscal year if it determines that such a change would be in our best interests andthose of our stockholders. The AC believes it is in the best interests of NVIDIA and our stockholders to retain PwC.We expect that a representative of PwC will attend the 2020 Meeting. The PwC representative will have an opportunity tomake a statement at the 2020 Meeting if he or she so desires. The representative will also be available to respond toappropriate stockholder questions.Recommendation of the BoardThe Board recommends that you vote FOR the ratification of the selection of PwC as our independent registered accountingfirm for our fiscal year ending January 31, 2021.42Fees Billed by the Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe following is a summary of fees billed by PwC for Fiscal 2020 and 2019 for audit, tax and other professional servicesduring each fiscal year: Fiscal 2020Fiscal 2019Audit Fees (1)$5,028,120$5,019,270Audit-Related Fees——Tax Fees (2)208,062403,816All Other Fees (3)4,5004,500Total Fees$5,240,682$5,427,586(1)Audit fees include fees for the audit of our consolidated financial statements, the audit of our internal control over financial reporting, reviews of ourquarterly financial statements and annual report, reviews of SEC registration statements and related consents, and fees related to statutory auditsof some of our international entities.(2)Tax fees consisted of fees for tax compliance and consultation services.(3)All other fees consisted of fees for products or services other than those included above, including payment to PwC related to the use of an accountingregulatory database.All of the services provided for Fiscal 2020 and 2019 described above were pre-approved by the AC or the Chairperson ofthe AC through the authority granted to him by the AC, which is described below.  Our AC determined that the rendering ofservices other than audit services by PwC was compatible with maintaining PwC’s independence.Pre-Approval Policies and ProceduresThe AC has adopted policies and procedures for the pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services renderedby our independent registered public accounting firm. The policy generally permits pre-approvals of specified permissibleservices in the defined categories of audit services, audit-related services and tax services up to specified amounts. Pre-approval may also be given as part of the AC’s approval of the scope of the engagement of our independent registeredpublic accounting firm or on an individual case-by-case basis before the independent registered public accounting firm isengaged to provide each service. In some cases the full AC provides pre-approval for up to a year related to a particulardefined task or scope. In other cases, the AC has delegated power to Mr. McCaffery, the Chairperson of our AC, to pre-approveadditional non-audit services if the need for the service was unanticipated and approval is required prior to the next scheduledmeeting of the AC. Mr. McCaffery then communicates such pre-approval to the full AC at its next meeting. 43Report of the Audit Committee of the Board of DirectorsThe material in this report is not “soliciting material,” is not deemed “filed” with the SEC and is not to be incorporated by referencein any of our filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, whethermade before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in any such filing, except to the extentspecifically incorporated by reference therein.The Audit Committee, or AC, oversees accounting, financial reporting, internal control over financial reporting, financialpractices and audit activities of NVIDIA and its subsidiaries. The AC reviews the results and scope of the audit and otherservices provided by the independent registered public accounting firm and reviews financial statements and the accountingpolicies followed by NVIDIA prior to the issuance of the financial statements with both management and the independentregistered public accounting firm.Management is responsible for the financial reporting process, the preparation of consolidated financial statements inaccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, the system of internal control overfinancial reporting, and the procedures designed to facilitate compliance with accounting standards and applicable lawsand regulations. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or PwC, our independent registered public accounting firm for Fiscal 2020,was responsible for performing an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements and issuing a report on theconsolidated financial statements and of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 26,2020.  PwC’s judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of our accounting principles and such other matters arerequired to be disclosed to the AC under applicable standards. The AC oversees these processes. Also, the AC has ultimateauthority and responsibility to select, evaluate and, when appropriate, terminate the independent registered publicaccounting firm. The AC approves audit fees and non-audit services provided by and fees paid to the independent registeredpublic accounting firm.NVIDIA has an internal audit function that reports to the AC. This function is responsible for objectively reviewing andevaluating the adequacy, effectiveness and quality of our system of internal controls and the operating effectiveness of ourbusiness processes. The AC approves an annual internal audit plan and monitors the activities and performance of ourinternal audit function throughout the year to ensure the plan objectives are carried out and met.The AC members are not professional accountants or auditors, and their functions are not intended to duplicate or to certifythe activities of management or the independent registered public accounting firm. The AC does not plan or conduct audits,determine that our financial statements are complete and accurate and in accordance with GAAP or assess our internalcontrol over financial reporting. The AC relies, without additional independent verification, on the information provided byour management and on the representations made by management that the financial statements have been prepared withintegrity and objectivity, and the opinion of PwC that such financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP.In this context, the AC reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements for Fiscal 2020 withmanagement and our internal control over financial reporting with management and PwC. Specifically, the AC discussedwith PwC the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with AuditCommittees, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. We have received from PwC the writtendisclosures and letter required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regardingPwC’s communications with the AC concerning independence. The AC also considered whether the provision of certainpermitted non-audit services by PwC is compatible with PwC’s independence and discussed PwC’s independence with PwC.Based on the AC’s review and discussions, the AC recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidatedfinancial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of NVIDIA for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020.AUDIT COMMITTEEDawn HudsonMichael G.

The following description is a summary only and isqualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Proposed 2007 Plan, which is appended to this proxy statementas Appendix A and which we encourage stockholders to read in its entirety.46Purpose.  The Proposed 2007 Plan is designed to provide incentives for our employees, directors, and consultants to exertmaximum efforts for our success, and to give them an opportunity to benefit from increases in the value of our commonstock. Types of Awards.  The Proposed 2007 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options,restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, stock appreciation rights, other stock awards, and performanceawards that may be settled in cash, stock, or other property.Share Reserve.  Subject to adjustment for certain changes in our capitalization, the aggregate maximum number of sharesof our common stock authorized for issuance under the Proposed 2007 Plan is 244,367,766 shares, which includes14,800,000 newly requested shares. The following shares will not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Proposed 2007 Plan: (i) shares subjectto a Proposed 2007 Plan award which are withheld by us or tendered by a participant to satisfy the exercise or purchaseprice of, or tax withholding obligations in connection with, the award; and (ii) shares repurchased by us on the open marketwith the proceeds of the exercise or purchase price of a Proposed 2007 Plan award.Shares subject to a Proposed 2007 Plan award that (i) expires or otherwise terminates without being exercised in full; (ii)are forfeited to or repurchased by us; and (iii) are not issued because the award is settled in cash; will remain available forsubsequent issuance under the Proposed 2007 PlanEligibility.  All of our (including our affiliates’) approximately 14,226 employees, 11 non-employee directors and 4,160consultants as of April 13, 2020 are eligible to participate and may receive all awards other than incentive stock options,which may be granted only to our employees and those of our affiliates.Annual Per-Participant Limits.  Subject to adjustment for certain changes in our capitalization, no participant will be eligibleto be granted during any fiscal year more than: (i) 2,000,000 shares of our common stock subject to stock options, stockappreciation rights, and other stock awards whose value is determined by reference to an increase over an exercise orstrike price of at least 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date; (ii) 2,000,000 shares of ourcommon stock under performance stock awards; and (iii) $6,000,000 of performance cash awards. If a performance stockaward is in the form of a stock option or could be paid out in cash, it will count only against the performance stock awardlimit. Administration.  The Proposed 2007 Plan is administered by our Board, which has delegated concurrent authority to the CC,but may revest in itself some or all of the delegated power. Each of the Board and the CC is considered to be a PlanAdministrator for purposes of this Proposal 4.  Subject to the terms of the Proposed 2007 Plan and the limitations set forthbelow, the Plan Administrator may determine the recipients, numbers and types of awards to be granted, the exercise orpurchase price of awards, and other terms and conditions of awards, including the period of their exercisability and vesting,and the fair market value applicable to a stock award.The Plan Administrator may also delegate to one or more officers the authority to designate non-officer employees to berecipients of certain stock awards and the number of shares subject to such stock awards. Under any such delegation, thePlan Administrator will specify the total number of shares that may be subject to the stock awards granted by such officer.Vesting Acceleration Only in Limited Circumstances.  The Plan Administrator may accelerate the vesting or exercisability ofany award only in the event of a participant’s death or disability or in the event of a corporate transaction or change incontrol (as defined in the Proposed 2007 Plan and described below).Repricing; Cancellation and Re-Grant of Stock Awards.  The Plan Administrator does not have the authority to (i) reprice anyoutstanding stock option or stock appreciation right by reducing its exercise or strike price or (ii) cancel any such awardthat has an exercise or strike price greater than the current fair market value of our common stock in exchange for cashor other stock awards, without obtaining the approval of our stockholders within 12 months prior to the repricing orcancellation and re-grant event.Dividends and Dividend Equivalents.  The Proposed 2007 Plan provides that dividends or dividend equivalents may be paidor credited with respect to any shares of our common stock subject to an award, as determined by the Plan Administratorand contained in the applicable award agreement; provided, however, that (i) no dividends or dividend equivalents may bepaid with respect to any such shares before the date such shares have vested, (ii) any dividends or dividend equivalentsthat are credited with respect to any such shares will be subject to all of the terms and conditions applicable to such sharesunder the terms of the applicable award agreement (including any vesting conditions), and (iii) any dividends or dividend47equivalents that are credited with respect to any such shares will be forfeited to us on the date such shares are forfeitedto or repurchased by us due to a failure to vest.Section 162(m) Transition Relief for Performance-Based Compensation. Certain provisions in the Proposed 2007 Plan referto the “performance-based compensation” exception under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, or Section 162(m). Pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, this exception was repealed for taxable years beginning after December 31,2017. However, an award may still be eligible for this exception if, among other requirements, it is intended to qualify, andis eligible to qualify, as Section 162(m) performance-based compensation pursuant to the transition relief provided by theTax Cuts and Jobs Act for remuneration provided pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on November2, 2017 and which was not modified in any material respect on or after such date, or Section 162(m) Transition Relief.Accordingly, the provisions in the Proposed 2007 Plan which refer to the Section 162(m) performance-based compensationexception will only apply to any award that is intended to qualify, and is eligible to qualify, as Section 162(m) performance-based compensation pursuant to the Section 162(m) Transition Relief and, therefore, such provisions are not applicable toany other awards granted under the Proposed 2007 Plan.  However, even if an award is intended to qualify as Section 162(m) performance-based compensation, no assurance can be given that the award will in fact qualify for the Section 162(m)Transition Relief or the Section 162(m) performance-based compensation exception.Stock Options.  The Proposed 2007 Plan permits the grant of stock options that qualify as incentive stock options, or ISOs,and nonstatutory stock options, or NSOs.The exercise price of stock options may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the underlying common stock onthe date of grant and, in some cases (see Limitations on Incentive Stock Options below), may not be less than 110% of suchfair market value.The term of stock options may not exceed ten years and, in some cases (see Limitations on Incentive Stock Options below),may not exceed five years. Except as otherwise provided in a participant’s stock option agreement or other agreement withus, (i) if a participant’s service relationship with us or any of our affiliates (referred to in this Proposal 4 as “continuousservice”) terminates (other than for cause or upon the participant’s death or disability), the participant may exercise anyvested stock options for up to 90 days following such termination; (ii) if a participant’s continuous service is terminated forcause, then upon such date all vested and unvested stock options of the participant will terminate and the participant willbe prohibited from exercising any stock option; and (iii) if a participant’s continuous service terminates due to the participant’sdeath (or the participant dies within a specified period, if any, following termination of continuous service) or the participant’sdisability, the participant or his or her beneficiary, as applicable, may exercise any vested stock options for up to 18 monthsfollowing the participant’s death and for up to 12 months following the participant’s termination due to disability. The termof a stock option may be extended if exercise of the stock option following a participant’s termination of continuous serviceis prohibited by applicable securities laws or would subject the participant to short-swing liability under the Exchange Act.In no event may a stock option be exercised after its original expiration date.Acceptable forms of consideration for the purchase of our common stock pursuant to the exercise of a stock option will bedetermined by the Plan Administrator and may include: (i) cash, check, bank draft, money order or electronic funds transfer;(ii) payment pursuant to a program developed under Regulation T as promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board; (iii) a netexercise feature (for NSOs only); or (iv) other legal consideration approved by the Plan Administrator.Stock options may vest and become exercisable in accordance with a vesting schedule to be determined by the PlanAdministrator. In the event that a participant’s continuous service terminates due to his or her death, the participant’soutstanding stock options will become fully vested and exercisable.Generally, a participant may not transfer a stock option other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution or pursuantto a domestic relations order or an official marital settlement agreement. However, to the extent permitted by the PlanAdministrator, a participant may designate a beneficiary who may exercise the stock option following the participant’sdeath.Limitations on Incentive Stock Options.  The aggregate fair market value, determined at the time of grant, of shares of ourcommon stock with respect to ISOs that are exercisable for the first time by a participant during any calendar year underall of our stock plans may not exceed $100,000. The stock options or portions of stock options that exceed this limit orotherwise fail to qualify as ISOs are treated as NSOs. No ISO may be granted to any person who, at the time of grant, ownsor is deemed to own stock possessing more than 10% of our total combined voting power or that of any affiliate unless thefollowing conditions are satisfied:48•the exercise price of the ISO must be at least 110% of the fair market value of the common stock subject to theISO on the date of grant; and•the term of the ISO must not exceed five years from the date of grant.Subject to adjustment for certain changes in our capitalization, the aggregate maximum number of shares of our commonstock that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of ISOs granted under the Proposed 2007 Plan (including ISOs grantedunder our prior plans) is 250,000,000 shares.Restricted Stock Awards.  Restricted stock awards may be granted in consideration for: (i) cash, check, bank draft, moneyorder or electronic funds transfer; (ii) the participant’s services performed for us or an affiliate of ours; or (iii) any otherform of legal consideration acceptable to the Plan Administrator. Shares of our common stock acquired under a restrictedstock award may be forfeited to us in accordance with a vesting schedule to be determined by the Plan Administrator,provided that if a participant’s continuous service terminates due to his or her death, the participant’s outstanding restrictedstock awards will become fully vested. Rights to acquire shares of our common stock under a restricted stock award maybe transferred only pursuant to the restricted stock award agreement.  If a participant’s continuous service terminates, anyof the participant’s unvested restricted stock awards may be forfeited to or repurchased by us in accordance with theapplicable restricted stock award agreement. Restricted Stock Unit Awards.  The consideration to be paid, if any, by a participant for restricted stock unit awards grantedunder the Proposed 2007 Plan may be made in any form of legal consideration acceptable to the Plan Administrator.Restricted stock unit awards may be settled by delivery of our common stock, cash, or any other form of considerationdetermined by the Plan Administrator and set forth in the restricted stock unit award agreement. Restricted stock unitawards may be subject to a vesting schedule as determined by the Plan Administrator, provided that if a participant’scontinuous service terminates due to his or her death, the participant’s outstanding restricted stock unit awards will becomefully vested. Except as otherwise provided in the applicable restricted stock unit award agreement, unvested restrictedstock units will be forfeited upon a participant’s termination of continuous service. Stock Appreciation Rights.  Each stock appreciation right is denominated in common stock share equivalents. The associatedstrike price will be determined by the Plan Administrator but will be no less than 100% of the fair market value of theunderlying common stock at the time of grant. The Plan Administrator may also impose restrictions upon the vesting ofstock appreciation rights. In the event that a participant’s continuous service terminates due to his or her death, theparticipant’s outstanding stock appreciation rights will become fully vested and exercisable. The appreciation distributionfor stock appreciation rights may be paid in our common stock, cash, or any other form of consideration approved by thePlan Administrator and set forth in the stock appreciation right agreement. The term of stock appreciation rights may notexceed ten years. Stock appreciation rights will be subject to the same conditions upon termination of continuous serviceand restrictions on transfer as stock options.Performance Awards.  We may grant performance stock and cash awards, including Section 162(m) “performance-basedcompensation”.   However, to qualify as Section 162(m) performance-based compensation, among other requirements,such awards must be eligible to qualify for the Section 162(m) Transition Relief (as described in Section 162(m) TransitionRelief for Performance-Based Compensation above).A performance stock award and a performance cash award is payable (for performance stock awards, including that maybe granted, vest, or be exercised) contingent upon the achievement of specified performance goals during a specifiedperformance period, and may also require completion of a specified period of continuous service. The length of anyperformance period, the performance goals to be achieved, and the measure of whether and to what degree suchperformance goals have been attained will be determined by the CC, except that the Plan Administrator also may make anysuch determinations to the extent that the award is not intended to qualify as Section 162(m) performance-basedcompensation. The Plan Administrator may specify the form of payment of performance cash awards, or may provide fora participant to have the option for his or her performance cash award, or such portion thereof as the Plan Administratormay specify, to be paid in whole or in part in cash or other property. In addition, to the extent permitted by applicable lawand the applicable award agreement, the Plan Administrator may determine that cash may be used in payment ofperformance stock awards, or that common stock authorized under the Proposed 2007 Plan may be used in payment ofperformance cash awards. If a participant’s continuous service terminates due to his or her death, the participant’soutstanding performance stock awards will be deemed to have been earned at the target level of performance, and becomefully vested and issued.For any performance award intended to qualify as Section 162(m) performance-based compensation, (i) the CC will set aperformance period over which the attainment of one or more performance goals will be measured, (ii) no later than the49earlier of the 90th day of a performance period and the date on which 25% of the performance period has elapsed, and ata time when the achievement of the performance goals remains substantially uncertain, the CC will establish theperformance goals based upon one or more performance criteria enumerated in the Proposed 2007 Plan and describedbelow, (iii) as soon as administratively practicable following the end of the performance period, the CC will certify in writingwhether the performance goals have been satisfied, and (iv) the CC may reduce or eliminate the compensation or economicbenefit due upon the attainment of the applicable performance goals as the CC may determine. However, to qualify asSection 162(m) performance-based compensation, among other requirements, any such award must be eligible to qualifyfor the Section 162(m) Transition Relief (as described in Section 162(m) Transition Relief for Performance-Based Compensationabove).Performance goals under the Proposed 2007 Plan will be based on any one or more of the following performance criteria:•earnings, including any of the following: gross profit,operating income, income before income tax, netincome, and earnings per share, in each case with anyone of or combination of the following exclusions orinclusions: (a) interest income, (b) interest expense, (c)other income that is categorized as non-operatingincome, (d) other expense that is categorized as non-operating expense, (e) income tax, (f) depreciation, and(g) amortization;•total stockholder return;•return on equity or average stockholder’s equity;•return on assets, investment, or capital employed; •stock price;•gross profit margin;•operating income margin;•cash flow from operating activities (including cash flowfrom operating activities per share);•free cash flow (including free cash flow per share);•change in cash and cash equivalents (or cash flow)(including change in cash and cash equivalents pershare (or cash flow per share));•sales or revenue targets;•increases in revenue or product revenue;•expenses and cost reduction goals;•improvement in or attainment of expense levels;•improvement in or attainment of working capital levels;•economic value added (or an equivalent metric);•market share;•share price performance;•debt reduction;•implementation or completion of projects or processes;•customer satisfaction;•stockholders’ equity;•capital expenditures;•debt levels;•workforce diversity;•growth of net income or operating income;•employee retention;•quality measures; and•to the extent that an award is not intended to qualify asSection 162(m) performance-based compensation,other measures of performance selected by the PlanAdministrator.50Performance goals may be based on a company-wide basis, with respect to one or more business units, divisions, affiliatesor business segments, and in either absolute terms or relative to the performance of one or more comparable companiesor the performance of one or more relevant indices. The CC (or, to the extent that an award is not intended to qualify asSection 162(m) performance-based compensation, the Plan Administrator) will be authorized to adjust the method ofcalculating performance goal achievement for a performance period as follows, provided that any such adjustments mustbe objectively determinable to the extent that the award is intended to qualify as Section 162(m) performance-basedcompensation: •to exclude the effects of stock-based compensation(including any modification charges);•to exclude the portion of any legal settlement assignedas past infringement (i.e. the fair value associated withthe portion of settlement that is non-recurring);•to exclude restructuring charges (including any costsassociated with a reduction in force and/or shuttingdown of business operations, such as severancecompensation and benefits and the cost to shut downoperating sites/offices);•to exclude amortization expenses associated withintangible assets obtained through a businesscombination (acquisition or asset purchase);•to exclude other costs incurred in connection withacquisitions or divestitures (including potentialacquisitions or divestitures) that are required to beexpensed under GAAP (including any direct acquisitioncosts that are not associated with providing ongoingfuture benefit to the combined company and certaincompensation costs associated with an acquisition,such as one-time compensation charges, longer-termretention incentives, and associated payroll taxcharges);•to exclude any exchange rate effects;•to exclude the effects of changes to GAAP;•to exclude the effects of any statutory adjustments tocorporate tax rates or changes in tax legislation;•to exclude the portion of tax related settlements; •to exclude the effects of any items of an unusual natureor of infrequency of occurrence;•to exclude the dilutive effects of acquisitions or jointventures;•to exclude the effect of any change in the outstandingshares of our common stock by reason of any stockdividend or split, stock repurchase, reorganization,recapitalization, merger, consolidation, spin-off,combination or exchange of shares or other similarcorporate change, or any distributions to commonstockholders other than regular cash dividends;•to exclude the effects of the award of bonuses underour bonus plans;•to exclude any impairment of long-lived assetsincluding goodwill, investments in non-affiliated entitiesand intangible asset impairment charges that arerequired to be recorded under GAAP;•to exclude other events that are significant but notrelated to ongoing business operations, such as largecharitable donations;•to assume that any business divested by us achievedperformance objectives at targeted levels during thebalance of a performance period following suchdivestiture;•to include non-operational credits (i.e., situations whendirectly related amounts have not been previouslycharged to our results of operations); and•to the extent that an award is not intended to qualify asSection 162(m) performance-based compensation, tomake any other adjustments selected by the PlanAdministrator.Other Stock Awards.  Other forms of stock awards valued in whole or in part with reference to our common stock may begranted. Subject to the terms of the Proposed 2007 Plan and the limitations set forth above (including the limitationsdescribed in Vesting Acceleration Only in Limited Circumstances above), the Plan Administrator will have sole and completeauthority to determine the persons to whom and the times at which such other stock awards will be granted, the numberof shares of our common stock to be granted and all other conditions of such other stock awards. In the event that aparticipant’s continuous service terminates due to his or her death, then any such other stock awards held by the participantwill become fully vested.Clawback Policy.  Granted awards will be subject to recoupment in accordance with any clawback policy that we are requiredto adopt pursuant to the listing standards of any national securities exchange or association on which our securities arelisted or as is otherwise required by the Dodd Frank Act or other applicable law. In addition, the Plan Administrator mayimpose other clawback, recovery, or recoupment provisions in an award agreement as the Plan Administrator determinesnecessary or appropriate, including a reacquisition right in respect of previously acquired shares of our common stock orother cash or property upon the occurrence of cause.Changes in Capitalization.  In the event of certain capitalization adjustments, the Plan Administrator will proportionatelyadjust: (i) the class(es) and maximum number of securities subject to the Proposed 2007 Plan; (ii) the class(es) and maximumnumber of securities that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of ISOs; (iii) the class(es) and maximum number ofsecurities that may be awarded to any person pursuant to the annual per-participant limits under the Proposed 2007 Plan;and (iv) the class(es) and number of securities and price per share of stock subject to outstanding stock awards.51Corporate Transaction; Change in Control.  Except as otherwise stated in a stock award agreement, in the event of a corporatetransaction or a change in control (as defined in the Proposed 2007 Plan and described below), outstanding stock awardsunder the Proposed 2007 Plan may be assumed, continued, or substituted by the surviving or acquiring corporation (or itsparent company). Except as otherwise stated in a stock award agreement, if the surviving or acquiring corporation (or itsparent company) does not assume, continue, or substitute such stock awards, then (i) contingent upon the effectiveness ofthe corporate transaction or change in control, any such stock awards that are held by participants whose continuousservice has not terminated prior to the effective time of the corporate transaction or change in control will become fullyvested and exercisable, and such stock awards will be terminated if not exercised prior to the effective time of the corporatetransaction or change in control and any reacquisition or repurchase rights held by us with respect to such stock awardswill lapse, and (ii) all other stock awards will be terminated if not exercised prior to the effective time of the corporatetransaction or change in control, provided that any reacquisition or repurchase rights held by us with respect to such stockawards may continue to be exercised.For purposes of the Proposed 2007 Plan, a corporate transaction will be deemed to occur in the event of the consummationof: (i) a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our consolidated assets or of at least 50% of our outstandingsecurities, in the case of awards granted on or after the date of the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and at least 90%of our outstanding securities, in the case of awards granted prior to the date of the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders;or (ii) a merger, consolidation, or similar transaction following which (A) we are not the surviving corporation, or (B) we arethe surviving corporation but the shares of our common stock outstanding immediately prior to such transaction areconverted or exchanged into other property by virtue of the transaction.For purposes of the Proposed 2007 Plan, a change in control will be deemed to occur in the event: (i) a person, entity orgroup acquires, directly or indirectly, securities of NVIDIA representing more than 50% of the combined voting power of ourthen outstanding securities, other than by virtue of a merger, consolidation, or similar transaction; (ii) there is consummateda merger, consolidation, or similar transaction and, immediately after the consummation of such transaction, ourstockholders immediately prior thereto do not own, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the combined outstanding votingpower of the surviving entity or the parent of the surviving entity in substantially the same proportions as their ownershipof our outstanding voting securities immediately prior to such transaction; (iii) there is consummated a sale or otherdisposition of all or substantially all of our consolidated assets, other than a sale or other disposition to an entity in whichmore than 50% of the entity’s combined voting power is owned by our stockholders in substantially the same proportionsas their ownership of our outstanding voting securities immediately prior to such sale or other disposition; or (iv) a majorityof our Board becomes comprised of individuals whose nomination, appointment, or election was not approved by a majorityof the Board members or their approved successors.Plan Amendments and Termination.  The Plan Administrator will have the authority to amend or terminate the Proposed2007 Plan at any time. However, except as otherwise provided in the Proposed 2007 Plan, no such amendment or terminationmay materially impair any rights under awards already granted to a participant unless agreed to by the affected participant.We will obtain stockholder approval of any amendment to the Proposed 2007 Plan as required by applicable law and listingrequirements. Unless sooner terminated, the Proposed 2007 Plan will automatically terminate on April 26, 2030.U.S. Federal Income Tax ConsequencesThe following is a summary of the principal United States federal income taxation consequences to participants and uswith respect to participation in the Proposed 2007 Plan. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, and does not discussthe income tax laws of any local, state or foreign jurisdiction in which a participant may reside. The information is basedupon current federal income tax rules and therefore is subject to change when those rules change. Each participant shouldconsult the participant’s tax adviser regarding the tax consequences of the grant or exercise of an award or the dispositionof stock acquired the Proposed 2007 Plan. The Proposed 2007 Plan is not qualified under the provisions of Section 401(a)of the Internal Revenue Code and is not subject to any of the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Actof 1974. Our ability to realize the benefit of any tax deductions described below depends on our generation of taxable incomeas well as the requirement of reasonableness, the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and thesatisfaction of our tax reporting obligations.Nonstatutory Stock Options.  Generally, there is no taxation upon the grant of an NSO if the stock option is granted with anexercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the grant date. On exercise, a participant will recognizeordinary income equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value on the date of exercise of the stock option over theexercise price. If the participant is employed by us or one of our affiliates, that income will be subject to withholding taxes.The participant’s tax basis in those shares will be equal to their fair market value on the date of exercise of the stock option,and the participant’s capital gain holding period for those shares will begin on that date.52Subject to the requirement of reasonableness, the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and thesatisfaction of a tax reporting obligation, we will generally be entitled to a tax deduction equal to the taxable ordinary incomerealized by the participant.Incentive Stock Options.  The Proposed 2007 Plan provides for the grant of stock options that are intended to qualify as“incentive stock options,” as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Internal Revenue Code, aparticipant generally is not subject to ordinary income tax upon the grant or exercise of an ISO. If the participant holds ashare received on exercise of an ISO for more than two years from the date the stock option was granted and more thanone year from the date the stock option was exercised, which is referred to as the required holding period, the difference,if any, between the amount realized on a sale or other taxable disposition of that share and the holder’s tax basis in thatshare will be long-term capital gain or loss.If, however, a participant disposes of a share acquired on exercise of an ISO before the end of the required holding period,which is referred to as a disqualifying disposition, the participant generally will recognize ordinary income in the year ofthe disqualifying disposition equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the share on the date the ISO was exercisedover the exercise price. However, if the sales proceeds are less than the fair market value of the share on the date of exerciseof the stock option, the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant will not exceed the gain, if any, realizedon the sale. If the amount realized on a disqualifying disposition exceeds the fair market value of the share on the date ofexercise of the stock option, that excess will be short-term or long-term capital gain, depending on whether the holdingperiod for the share exceeds one year.For purposes of the alternative minimum tax, the amount by which the fair market value of a share of stock acquired onexercise of an ISO exceeds the exercise price of that stock option generally will be an adjustment included in the participant’salternative minimum taxable income for the year in which the stock option is exercised. If, however, there is a disqualifyingdisposition of the share in the year in which the stock option is exercised, there will be no adjustment for alternative minimumtax purposes with respect to that share. In computing alternative minimum taxable income, the tax basis of a share acquiredon exercise of an ISO is increased by the amount of the adjustment taken into account with respect to that share foralternative minimum tax purposes in the year the stock option is exercised.We are not allowed an income tax deduction with respect to the grant or exercise of an ISO or the disposition of a shareacquired on exercise of an ISO after the required holding period. If there is a disqualifying disposition of a share, however,we are allowed a deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income includible in income by the participant, subject toSection 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and provided that amount constitutes an ordinary and necessary businessexpense for us and is reasonable in amount, and either the employee includes that amount in income or we timely satisfyour reporting requirements with respect to that amount.Restricted Stock Awards.  Generally, the recipient of a restricted stock award will recognize ordinary income at the time thestock is received equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the stock received over any amount paid by therecipient in exchange for the stock. If, however, the stock is not vested when it is received (for example, if the employee isrequired to work for a period of time in order to have the right to sell the stock), the recipient generally will not recognizeincome until the stock becomes vested, at which time the recipient will recognize ordinary income equal to the excess, ifany, of the fair market value of the stock on the date it becomes vested over any amount paid by the recipient in exchangefor the stock. A recipient may, however, file an election with the Internal Revenue Service, within 30 days following his orher receipt of the stock award, to recognize ordinary income, as of the date the recipient receives the award, equal to theexcess, if any, of the fair market value of the stock on the date the award is granted over any amount paid by the recipientfor the stock.The recipient’s basis for the determination of gain or loss upon the subsequent disposition of shares acquired from stockawards will be the amount paid for such shares plus any ordinary income recognized either when the stock is received orwhen the stock becomes vested.Subject to the requirement of reasonableness, the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and thesatisfaction of a tax reporting obligation, we will generally be entitled to a tax deduction equal to the taxable ordinary incomerealized by the recipient of the stock award.Restricted Stock Unit Awards.  Generally, the recipient of a restricted stock unit award structured to conform to therequirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code or an exception to Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Codewill recognize ordinary income at the time the stock is delivered equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of theshares of our common stock received over any amount paid by the recipient in exchange for the shares of our commonstock. To conform to the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, the shares of our common stock53subject to a restricted stock unit award may generally only be delivered upon one of the following events: a fixed calendardate (or dates), separation from service, death, disability or a change in control. If delivery occurs on another date, unlessthe restricted stock unit award otherwise complies with or qualifies for an exception to the requirements of Section 409Aof the Internal Revenue Code, in addition to the tax treatment described above, the recipient will owe an additional 20%federal tax and interest on any taxes owed.The recipient’s basis for the determination of gain or loss upon the subsequent disposition of shares acquired from arestricted stock unit award will be the amount paid for such shares plus any ordinary income recognized when the stockis delivered.Subject to the requirement of reasonableness, the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and thesatisfaction of a tax reporting obligation, we will generally be entitled to a tax deduction equal to the taxable ordinary incomerealized by the recipient of the stock award.Stock Appreciation Rights.  We may grant stock appreciation rights separate from any other award or in tandem with otherawards. Where the stock appreciation rights are granted with a strike price equal to the fair market value of the underlyingstock on the grant date, the recipient will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the stock or cashreceived upon such exercise. Subject to the requirement of reasonableness, the provisions of Section 162(m) of the InternalRevenue Code, and the satisfaction of a tax reporting obligation, we will generally be entitled to a tax deduction equal to thetaxable ordinary income realized by the recipient of the stock appreciation right.Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code disallows a deduction to anypublicly held corporation and its affiliates for certain compensation paid to “covered employees” in a taxable year to theextent that compensation to a covered employee exceeds $1 million. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,compensation that qualified as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Codewas not subject to this deduction limitation. Pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, this exception for “performance-basedcompensation” under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code was repealed with respect to taxable years beginningafter December 31, 2017, except that certain transition relief is provided by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for remunerationprovided pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on November 2, 2017 and which was not modified inany material respect on or after such date. As a result, compensation paid to any of our “covered employees” in excess of$1 million per taxable year generally will not be deductible unless, among other requirements, it is intended to qualify, andis eligible to qualify, as “performance-based compensation” under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code pursuantto the transition relief provided by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Because of certain ambiguities and uncertainties as to theapplication and interpretation of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as well as other factors beyond the controlof the CC, no assurance can be given that any award granted under the Proposed 2007 Plan will be eligible for such transitionrelief and, therefore, eligible for the “performance-based compensation” exception under Section 162(m) of the InternalRevenue Code.54New Plan BenefitsAwards under the Proposed 2007 Plan are discretionary and are not subject to set benefits or amounts under the terms ofthe Proposed 2007 Plan. However, our Board’s current policy establishes the number of shares subject to initial and annualstock awards that will be granted to our non-employee directors under the Proposed 2007 Plan. The Board’s current policywith respect to stock awards granted to our non-employee directors is described under Director Compensation above.Proposed 2007 PlanName and PositionDollar ValueNumber of Shares Subject toStock AwardsJen-Hsun Huang (1)President and CEO**Colette M.

Approval of an amendment and restatement of our 2012 ESPP.Vote required:  A majority of the shares present or represented by proxy.Effect of abstentions:  Same as a vote AGAINST.Effect of broker non-votes:  None.For purposes of this Proposal 5, the term “Proposed 2012 ESPP” refers to an amendment and restatement of our 2012ESPP.  Our CC approved the Proposed 2012 ESPP in April 2020, subject to stockholder approval, which we are requestingat the 2020 Meeting.Summary of ChangeThe Proposed 2012 ESPP contains the following material change from the 2012 ESPP:•Increased Shares Authorized for Issuance.  An increase of 2,000,000 shares, for an aggregate maximum numberof shares of our common stock authorized for issuance under the Proposed 2012 ESPP of 93,432,333 shares,subject to adjustment for certain changes in our capitalization.As of April 13, 2020, 58,108,549 shares of our common stock remained available for future issuance under the 2012 ESPPand a total of 615,135,104 shares of our common stock were outstanding.Purpose of the Proposed 2012 ESPP and Effect of Stockholder ApprovalApproval of the Proposed 2012 ESPP will allow us to continue to provide our employees with the opportunity to acquire anownership interest in NVIDIA through their participation in the Proposed ESPP, encouraging them to remain in our employand more closely aligning their interests with those of our stockholders.If this Proposal 5 is approved by our stockholders, the Proposed 2012 ESPP will become effective upon the date of the 2020Meeting. In the event that our stockholders do not approve this Proposal 5, the Proposed 2012 ESPP will not become effectiveand our 2012 ESPP will continue in its current form.Recommendation of the BoardThe Board recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the Proposed 2012 ESPP.57Description of the Proposed 2012 ESPPThe material features of the Proposed 2012 ESPP are outlined below. The following description is a summary only and isqualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Proposed 2012 ESPP, which is appended to this proxystatement as Appendix B and which we encourage stockholders to read in its entirety.Purpose and Background.  The Proposed 2012 ESPP is designed to provide certain employees with an opportunity to purchaseour common stock, and to motivate those individuals to exert maximum efforts for our success.The Proposed 2012 ESPP includes two components.  One component allows eligible employees to purchase our commonstock in a manner that may qualify for favorable tax treatment under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition,purchase rights may be granted under a second component that does not qualify for favorable tax treatment because ofdeviations necessary to permit participation by eligible employees who are foreign nationals or employed outside of theU.S. while complying with applicable foreign laws.Administration.  The Proposed 2012 ESPP is administered by our Board, which has delegated concurrent authority to theCC, but may revest in itself some or all of the delegated power. Each of the Board and the CC is considered to be a PlanAdministrator for purposes of this Proposal 5. The Plan Administrator has the final power to construe and interpret boththe Proposed 2012 ESPP and the purchase rights granted thereunder. The Plan Administrator has the power, subject to theprovisions of the Proposed 2012 ESPP, to determine the provisions of each offering of rights to purchase our common stock,and whether employees of any of our parent or subsidiary companies (or any branch or representative office thereof) willbe eligible to participate in the Proposed 2012 ESPP.Share Reserve.  Subject to adjustment for certain changes in our capitalization, the aggregate maximum number of sharesof our common stock authorized for issuance under the Proposed 2012 ESPP is 93,432,333 shares, which includes 2,000,000newly requested shares. If any purchase right granted under the Proposed 2012 ESPP terminates without having been exercised in full, the sharesof common stock not purchased will again become available for issuance under the Proposed 2012 ESPP.Offering Periods.  Shares of our common stock are offered through a series of offering periods of such duration as determinedby the Plan Administrator, provided that in no event may an offering period exceed 27 months. We may have concurrent oroverlapping separate offerings which vary in terms. Each offering period has one or more purchase dates, as determinedby the Plan Administrator prior to the commencement of that offering period. The Plan Administrator has the authority toalter the duration of subsequent offering periods or change the number of purchase dates within each such offering period.When an eligible employee elects to join an offering period, he or she is granted a purchase right to acquire shares of ourcommon stock on each purchase date within the offering period. On the purchase date, all contributions collected from theparticipant are automatically applied to the purchase of our common stock, subject to certain limitations.The Plan Administrator has the discretion to structure an offering so that if the fair market value of our common stock onthe first trading day of a new purchase period within the offering period is less than or equal to a participant’s offering dateprice, then with respect to such participant, that offering will terminate immediately as of that first trading day and suchparticipant will be automatically enrolled in a new offering beginning on that trading day.For purposes of this Proposal 5, a participant’s “offering date price” means, with respect to each participant participatingin an offering, the fair market value of our common stock on the offering date applicable to such participant (i.e., the dateon which such participant is granted a purchase right for such offering).Eligibility.  Generally, each employee employed by us, or by any of our parent or subsidiary companies (or by any branch orrepresentative office thereof) designated by the Plan Administrator, may participate in offerings, provided such employeehas been in our continuous employment for such period preceding the first day of the offering period as the PlanAdministrator may require, but in no event may the required period of continuous employment be equal to or greater thantwo years. In addition, the Plan Administrator may (unless prohibited by law) provide that an employee will not be eligibleto be granted purchase rights unless such employee is customarily employed for more than 20 hours per week and fivemonths per calendar year. The Plan Administrator may provide in any offering that certain of our employees who are “highlycompensated” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code are not eligible to participate.However, no employee is eligible to participate if, immediately after the grant of purchase rights, the employee would own,directly or indirectly, stock possessing 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of our stockor of any of our parent or subsidiary companies, including any stock which such employee may purchase under alloutstanding purchase rights and options. In addition, no employee may purchase more than $25,000 worth of our common58stock, valued at the time each purchase right is granted, for each calendar year during which those purchase rights areoutstanding.All of our approximately 14,552 employees as of April 13, 2020 who meet the eligibility requirements set forth above areeligible to participate.Participation.  An eligible employee may enroll by delivering to us, prior to the date selected by the Plan Administrator asthe beginning of an offering period, an agreement authorizing contributions as specified by the Plan Administrator, whichmay be up to 15% of such employee’s earnings during the applicable period. Purchase Price.  The purchase price per share at which shares of our common stock are sold on each purchase date duringan offering period will not be less than 85% of the lesser of (i) the fair market value per share of our common stock on thatpurchase date or (ii) the participant’s offering date price (as described in Offering Periods above). As of April 13, 2020, theclosing price of our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market was $269.85 per share.Payment of Purchase Price; Contributions.  The purchase price of the shares is generally funded by payroll deductionsaccumulated over the offering period, unless otherwise required by local laws.  All contributions made for a participant arecredited to his or her account and deposited with our general funds, unless otherwise required by local laws.Purchase of Stock.  By executing an agreement to participate, an employee is entitled to purchase shares.  The PlanAdministrator may specify a maximum number of shares of common stock that each participant may purchase and amaximum aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be purchased by all participants in such offering. If theaggregate number of shares to be purchased upon exercise of outstanding purchase rights in the offering would exceedany such maximum number, the Plan Administrator will make a pro rata allocation of available shares in a uniform andequitable manner. Unless an employee’s participation is discontinued, his or her right to purchase shares is exercisedautomatically on the next purchase date at the applicable price. See Withdrawal below.Withdrawal.  Participants may withdraw from a given offering period by delivering a form provided by us and terminatingtheir contributions. Such withdrawal may occur at any time prior to the end of an offering, except as otherwise provided bythe Plan Administrator. Upon such withdrawal, we will refund accumulated but unused contributions without interest tothe employee, and such employee’s right to participate in that offering will terminate. An employee’s withdrawal from anoffering does not affect eligibility to participate in future offerings.Termination of Employment.  Purchase rights terminate immediately upon cessation of employment for any reason or if aparticipant is otherwise no longer eligible to participate, and we will refund all accumulated but unused contributions withoutinterest.Restrictions on Transfer and Sales.  Purchase rights are not transferable and may be exercised only by the person to whomsuch rights are granted, except by will, by the laws of descent and distribution, or, if permitted by us by a beneficiarydesignation.Changes in Capitalization.  In the event of certain capitalization adjustments, the Plan Administrator will proportionatelyadjust: (i) the class(es) and maximum number of securities subject to the Proposed 2012 ESPP; (ii) the class(es) and numberof securities and price per share in effect under each outstanding purchase right; and (iii) the class(es) and number ofsecurities that are the subject of any purchase limits under each ongoing offering.Corporate Transaction.  In the event of a corporate transaction (as defined in the Proposed 2012 ESPP and described below),any surviving or acquiring corporation (or its parent company) may assume or continue outstanding purchase rights orsubstitute similar purchase rights for outstanding purchase rights. If the surviving or acquiring corporation (or its parentcompany) does not assume or continue such rights or substitute similar rights, then the participants’ accumulatedcontributions will be applied to the purchase of shares of our common stock within 10 business days prior to the corporatetransaction, and such outstanding purchase rights will terminate immediately thereafter.For purposes of the Proposed 2012 ESPP, a corporate transaction generally will be deemed to occur in the event of theconsummation of: (i) a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our consolidated assets or of at least 50% ofour outstanding securities; or (ii) a merger, consolidation or similar transaction following which (A) we are not the survivingcorporation, or (B) we are the surviving corporation but the shares of our common stock outstanding immediately prior tosuch transaction are converted or exchanged into other property by virtue of the transaction.Plan Amendments and Termination.  The Plan Administrator may amend or terminate the Proposed 2012 ESPP at any time.However, purchase rights granted before amendment or termination of the Proposed 2012 ESPP will not be materially59impaired by any such amendment or termination, except (i) with the consent of the affected participant, (ii) as necessaryto comply with any laws, listing requirements or governmental regulations (including Section 423 of the Internal RevenueCode) or (iii) as necessary to obtain or maintain favorable tax, listing, or regulatory treatment. We will obtain stockholderapproval of any amendment to the Proposed 2012 ESPP as required by applicable law and listing requirements.U.S. Federal Income Tax ConsequencesThe following is a summary of the principal United States federal income taxation consequences to employees and us withrespect to participation in the component of the Proposed 2012 ESPP intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchaseplan” within the meaning of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive, anddoes not discuss the income tax laws of any local, state or foreign jurisdiction in which a participant may reside or thetaxation consequences with respect to participation in any component of the Proposed 2012 ESPP not intended to meetthe requirements of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The information is based upon current federal income taxrules and therefore is subject to change when those rules change. Each participant should consult the participant’s taxadviser regarding the tax consequences of the grant or exercise of a purchase right or the disposition of stock acquired.The Proposed 2012 ESPP is not qualified under the provisions of Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code and is notsubject to any of the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Our ability to realize the benefitof any tax deductions described below depends on our generation of taxable income as well as the requirement ofreasonableness, the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and the satisfaction of our tax reportingobligations.A participant will be taxed on amounts withheld for the purchase of shares of our common stock as if such amounts werepaid directly to the participant. However, no taxable income will be recognized by a participant, and no deductions will beallowable to us, upon either the grant or exercise of purchase rights. Taxable income will not be recognized until there is asale or other disposition of the shares acquired, or in the event the participant should die while still owning the purchasedshares.If a participant sells or otherwise disposes of the purchased shares within two years after the beginning of the associatedoffering period or within one year after the purchase date, then the participant will recognize ordinary income in the yearof sale or disposition equal to the amount by which the fair market value of the shares on the purchase date exceeded thepurchase price, and we will be entitled to an income tax deduction, for the taxable year in which such disposition occurs,equal in amount to such excess. The participant will also recognize a capital gain to the extent the amount realized uponthe sale of the shares exceeds the sum of the aggregate purchase price for those shares and the ordinary income recognizedin connection with their acquisition.If the participant sells or otherwise disposes of the purchased shares more than two years after the beginning of theassociated offering period and more than one year after the purchase date, the participant will generally recognize ordinaryincome in the year of sale or disposition equal to the lesser of (a) the excess of the fair market value of the shares at thetime of such sale or disposition over the purchase price or (b) the excess of the fair market value of the shares as of thebeginning of the offering period over the purchase price (determined as of the beginning of the offering period).  Any furthergain or any loss will be taxed as a long-term capital gain or loss. We will not be entitled to an income tax deduction withrespect to such disposition.If the participant still owns the purchased shares at the time of death, then a transfer by the estate will be considered adistribution and the lesser of the following amounts will be treated as ordinary income: (a) the excess of the fair marketvalue of the shares at the time of death over the purchase price or (b) the excess of the fair market value of the shares asof the beginning of the offering period over the purchase price (determined as of the beginning of the offering period).  Anyfurther gain or any loss will be taxed as a long-term capital gain or loss.New Plan BenefitsParticipation will be voluntary and each eligible employee will make his or her own decision whether and to what extent toparticipate. In addition, we have not approved any grants of purchase rights that are conditioned on stockholder approvalof this Proposal 5. Accordingly, we cannot currently determine the benefits or number of shares that will be received in thefuture by individual employees or groups of employees. Our non-employee directors will not be eligible to participate. 602012 ESPP BenefitsThe following table shows, for each of the individuals and the various groups indicated, the number of shares of our commonstock that have been purchased under the 2012 ESPP since its initial approval by our stockholders in 2012 through April13, 2020.2012 ESPPName and PositionNumber of SharesPurchasedJen-Hsun HuangPresident and CEO5,520Colette M.

Neither the Board nor any Committee will have the authority to: (i)reduce the exercise or strike price of any outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights under the Plan, or (ii) cancelany outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights that have an exercise price or strike price greater than the currentFair Market Value in exchange for cash or other Stock Awards under the Plan, unless the stockholders of the Company haveapproved such an action within twelve (12) months prior to such an event.(g)Dividends and Dividend Equivalents.

Such maximum number of shares reserved for issuanceconsists of (i) 152,767,766 shares1, which is the total reserve that the Company’s stockholders approved at the Company’s___________1  The initial 101,845,177 shares approved in June 2007 were adjusted to 152,767,766 pursuant to a 3-for-2 stock split effective September 10, 2007.A-32007 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, including but not limited to the shares remaining available for issuance under thePrior Plans on the Effective Date and the Prior Plans’ Returning Shares, (ii) 25,000,000 shares that were approved at theCompany’s 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (and reapproved at the Company’s 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders),(iii) 10,000,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, (iv) 18,800,000 sharesthat were approved at the Company’s 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, (v) 23,000,000 shares that were approved atthe Company’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and (vi) 14,800,000 shares that were approved at the Company’s 2020Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  For clarity, the 2007 Plan Reserve in this Section 3(a) is a limitation on the number ofshares of Common Stock that may be issued pursuant to the Plan.  Accordingly, this Section 3(a) does not limit the grantingof Stock Awards except as provided in Section 7(a).  Shares may be issued in connection with a merger or acquisition aspermitted by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c) or, if applicable, NYSE Listed Company Manual Section 303A.08, AMEX CompanyGuide Section 711 or other applicable rule, and such issuance will not reduce the number of shares available for issuanceunder the Plan.

If any shares subject to a Stock Award are not deliveredto a Participant because such shares are withheld by the Company to satisfy the exercise or purchase price of a StockAward (including any shares subject to a Stock Award that are not delivered to a Participant because the Stock Award isexercised through a reduction of shares subject to the Stock Award (i.e., “net exercised”)) or an appreciation distribution inrespect of a Stock Appreciation Right is paid in shares of Common Stock, the number of shares subject to the Stock Awardthat are not delivered to the Participant shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan.  If any sharessubject to a Stock Award are not delivered to a Participant because such shares are withheld by the Company in satisfactionof the withholding of taxes incurred in connection with a Stock Award, the number of shares that are not delivered to theParticipant shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan.  If the exercise or purchase price of anyStock Award, or the withholding of taxes incurred in connection with a Stock Award, is satisfied by tendering shares ofCommon Stock held by the Participant (either by actual delivery or attestation), then the number of shares so tenderedshall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan.  If any shares of Common Stock are repurchased by theCompany on the open market with the proceeds of the exercise or purchase price of a Stock Award, then the number ofshares so repurchased shall not remain available for subsequent issuance under the Plan.

The stock issuable under the Plan will be shares of authorized but unissued or reacquiredCommon Stock, including shares repurchased by the Company on the open market or otherwise.4.Eligibility.(a)Eligibility for Specific Stock Awards.  Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to employees of the Companyor a “parent corporation” or “subsidiary corporation” thereof (as such terms are defined in Sections 424(e) and 424(f) of theA-4Code).

If an Option is not specifically designated as an Incentive Stock Option, or if an Option isdesignated as an Incentive Stock Option but some portion or all of the Option fails to qualify as an Incentive Stock Optionunder the applicable rules, then the Option (or portion thereof) will be a Nonstatutory Stock Option.

The appreciation distribution may bepaid in Common Stock, in cash, in any combination of the two or in any other form of consideration, as determined by theBoard and contained in the Award Agreement evidencing such SAR.(e)Transferability of Options and SARs.  The Board may, in its sole discretion, impose such limitations on thetransferability of Options and SARs as the Board will determine.

However, the Company may prohibit designation of a beneficiaryat any time, including due to any conclusion by the Company that such designation would be inconsistent with the provisionsof applicable laws or difficult to administer.  (f)Vesting Generally.  The total number of shares of Common Stock subject to an Option or SAR may vest and thereforebecome exercisable in periodic installments that may or may not be equal.  The Option or SAR may be subject to such otherterms and conditions on the time or times when it may or may not be exercised (which may be based on the satisfactionof Performance Goals or other criteria) as the Board may deem appropriate.  The vesting provisions of individual Optionsor SARs may vary; provided, however, that in all cases, in the event that a Participant’s Continuous Service terminates as aresult of his or her death, then the Option or SAR will become fully vested and exercisable as of the date of termination ofContinuous Service.

The foregoing provision is intended to operate so that any income derivedby a non-exempt employee in connection with the exercise or vesting of an Option or SAR will be exempt from his or herregular rate of pay.  To the extent permitted and/or required for compliance with the Worker Economic Opportunity Act toensure that any income derived by a non-exempt employee in connection with the exercise, vesting or issuance of anyshares under any other Stock Award will be exempt from the employee’s regular rate of pay, the provisions of this Section5(k) will apply to all Stock Awards and are hereby incorporated by reference into such Stock Award Agreements. 6.Provisions of Stock Awards other than Options and SARs.(a)Restricted Stock Awards.

For purposes of thisB-3Section 5(c), the rules of Section 424(d) of the Code will apply in determining the stock ownership of any Employee, andstock which such Employee may purchase under all outstanding Purchase Rights and options will be treated as stock ownedby such Employee.(d)As specified by Section 423(b)(8) of the Code, an Eligible Employee may be granted Purchase Rights only if suchPurchase Rights, together with any other rights granted under all Employee Stock Purchase Plans of the Company and anyRelated Corporations, do not permit such Eligible Employee's rights to purchase stock of the Company or any RelatedCorporation to accrue at a rate which exceeds $25,000 of Fair Market Value of such stock (determined at the time suchrights are granted, and which, with respect to the Plan, will be determined as of their respective Offering Dates) for eachcalendar year in which such rights are outstanding at any time.(e)Officers of the Company and any Designated Company, if they are otherwise Eligible Employees, will be eligible toparticipate in Offerings under the Plan.

If the aggregate purchase of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Purchase Rightsgranted under the Offering would exceed any such maximum aggregate number, then, in the absence of any Board actionotherwise, a pro rata (based on each Participant's accumulated Contributions) allocation of the shares of Common Stockavailable will be made in as nearly a uniform manner as will be practicable and equitable.(d)The purchase price of each share of Common Stock acquired pursuant to a Participant’s Purchase Right will benot less than the lesser of:(i)an amount equal to 85% of such Participant’s Offering Date Price; or(ii)an amount equal to 85% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the applicable PurchaseDate.7.Participation; Withdrawal; Termination.(a)An Eligible Employee may elect to authorize payroll deductions as the means of making Contributions by completingand delivering to the Company, within the time specified in the Offering, an enrollment form provided by the Company. Theenrollment form will specify the amount of Contributions not to exceed the maximum amount specified by the Board. EachParticipant's Contributions will be credited to a bookkeeping account for such Participant under the Plan and will be depositedwith the general funds of the Company except where applicable law requires that Contributions be deposited with a thirdparty or otherwise segregated. If permitted in the Offering, a Participant may reduce (including to zero) or increase his orher Contributions.  If required under applicable law or if specifically provided in the Offering, in addition to or instead ofmaking Contributions by payroll deductions, a Participant may make Contributions through the payment by cash or checkor wire transfer prior to a Purchase Date, in the manner directed by the Company.(b)During an Offering, a Participant may cease making Contributions and withdraw from the Offering by delivering tothe Company a withdrawal form provided by the Company.  The Company may impose a deadline before a Purchase Datefor withdrawing.  Upon such withdrawal, such Participant's Purchase Right in that Offering will immediately terminate andthe Company will distribute to such Participant all of his or her accumulated but unused Contributions.

The Company will distribute to such individual all of his or her accumulated but unusedContributions.(d)During a Participant's lifetime, Purchase Rights will be exercisable only by such Participant.  Purchase Rights arenot transferable by a Participant, except by will, by the laws of descent and distribution, or, if permitted by the Company, bya beneficiary designation as described in Section 10.  (e)The Company has no obligation to pay interest on Contributions, unless otherwise required by applicable law.8.Exercise of Purchase Rights.(a)On each Purchase Date, each Participant's accumulated Contributions will be applied to the purchase of shares ofCommon Stock, up to the maximum number of shares of Common Stock permitted by the Plan and the applicable Offering,at the purchase price specified in the Offering.  No fractional shares will be issued unless specifically provided for in theOffering.(b)If any amount of accumulated Contributions remains in a Participant's account after the purchase of shares ofCommon Stock on the final Purchase Date of an Offering and such remaining amount is less than the amount required topurchase one share of Common Stock, then such remaining amount will be held in such Participant's account for thepurchase of shares of Common Stock under the next Offering under the Plan, unless such Participant withdraws from oris not eligible to participate in such Offering, in which case such amount will be distributed to such Participant after thefinal Purchase Date, without interest (unless otherwise required by applicable law).  If the amount of Contributions remainingin a Participant's account after the purchase of shares of Common Stock on the final Purchase Date of an Offering is atleast equal to the amount required to purchase one whole share of Common Stock, then such remaining amount will notroll over to the next Offering and will instead be distributed in full to such Participant after the final Purchase Date, withoutinterest (unless otherwise required by applicable law).(c)No Purchase Rights may be exercised to any extent unless the shares of Common Stock to be issued upon suchexercise under the Plan are covered by an effective registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act and the Plan isin material compliance with all applicable laws.  If on a Purchase Date the shares of Common Stock are not so registeredor the Plan is not in such compliance, no Purchase Rights will be exercised on such Purchase Date, and the Purchase Datewill be delayed until the shares of Common Stock are subject to such an effective registration statement and the Plan is inmaterial compliance, except that the Purchase Date will in no event be more than 27 months from the Offering Date.  If, onthe Purchase Date, as delayed to the maximum extent permissible, the shares of Common Stock are not registered and thePlan is not in material compliance with all applicable laws, no Purchase Rights will be exercised and all accumulated butunused Contributions will be distributed to the Participants without interest (unless otherwise required under applicablelocal law).9.Covenants of the Company.The Company will seek to obtain from each federal, state, foreign or other regulatory commission or agency havingjurisdiction over the Plan such authority as may be required to grant Purchase Rights and issue and sell shares of CommonStock thereunder unless doing so would be an unreasonable cost to the Company compared to the potential benefit toEligible Employees which the Company shall determine at its discretion.  If, after commercially reasonable efforts, theCompany is unable to obtain the authority that counsel for the Company deems necessary for the grant of Purchase Rightsor the lawful issuance and sale of Common Stock under the Plan, and at a commercially reasonable cost, the Company willbe relieved from any liability for failure to grant Purchase Rights and/or to issue and sell Common Stock upon exercise ofsuch Purchase Rights.10.Designation of Beneficiary.(a)The Company may, but is not obligated to, permit a Participant to submit a form designating a beneficiary who willreceive any shares of Common Stock and/or Contributions from the Participant's account under the Plan if the Participantdies before such shares and/or Contributions are delivered to the Participant.  The Company may, but is not obligated to,permit the Participant to change such designation of beneficiary. Any such designation and/or change must be on a formapproved by the Company.(b)  If a Participant dies, and in the absence of a valid beneficiary designation, the Company will deliver any shares ofCommon Stock and/or Contributions to the executor or administrator of the estate of the Participant.  If no executor oradministrator has been appointed (to the knowledge of the Company), the Company, in its sole discretion, may deliver suchshares of Common Stock and/or Contributions to the Participant's spouse, dependents or relatives, or if no spouse, dependentor relative is known to the Company, then to such other person as the Company may designate.11.Adjustments upon Changes in Common Stock; Corporate Transactions.B-5(a)On a Capitalization Adjustment, the Board will appropriately and proportionately adjust: (i) the class(es) andmaximum number of securities subject to the Plan pursuant to Section 3(a); (ii) the class(es) and number of securitiessubject to, and the purchase price applicable to outstanding Offerings and Purchase Rights; and (iii) the class(es) and numberof securities that are the subject of the purchase limits under each ongoing Offering.

We believe the advent of AV will soon revolutionize the transportationindustry. In our view, AI is the key technology enabler of this opportunity, as the algorithms required for autonomous driving- such as perception, localization, and planning - are too complex for legacy hand-coded approaches, and will run on multipletrained neural networks instead. Therefore, we provided a full functionally safe AI-based hardware and software solutionfor the AV market under the DRIVE brand, which we are bringing to market through our partnerships with automotiveoriginal equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, tier-1 suppliers, and start-ups. Our AV solution also includes the GPU-basedhardware required to train the neural networks before their in-vehicle deployment, as well as to re-simulate their operationprior to any over-the-air software updates. We believe our comprehensive, top-to-bottom and end-to-end approach willenable the transportation industry to solve the complex problems arising from the shift to autonomous driving. Leveraging our intellectual property. We believe our intellectual property is a valuable asset that can be accessed by ourcustomers and partners through licenses and development agreements when they desire to build such capabilities directlyinto their own products, or have us do so through a custom development. Such license and development arrangementscan further enhance the reach of our technology.Sales and MarketingOur sales strategy involves working with end customers and various industry ecosystems through our partner network.Our worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to achieving our objective of providing markets with our high-performance and efficient GPU and embedded system-on-a-chip, or SOC, platforms. Our sales and marketing teams, locatedacross our global markets, work closely with end customers in each industry. Our partner network incorporates eachindustry's respective OEMs, original device manufacturers, or ODMs, system builders, add-in board manufacturers, or AIBs,retailers/distributors, internet and cloud service providers, automotive manufacturers and tier-1 automotive suppliers,mapping companies, start-ups, and other ecosystem participants.Members of our sales team have technical expertise and product and industry knowledge. We also employ a team ofapplication engineers to assist our partner network in designing, testing, and qualifying system designs that incorporateour platforms. We believe that the depth and quality of our design support are key to improving our partner network’s time-to-market, maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction, and fostering relationships that encourage our end customersand partner network to use the next generation of our products within each platform.To encourage the development of applications optimized for our GPUs, we seek to establish and maintain strong relationshipsin the software development community. Engineering and marketing personnel engage with key software developers topromote and discuss our platforms, as well as to ascertain individual product requirements and solve technical problems.8Our developer program makes our products available to developers prior to launch in order to encourage the developmentof AI frameworks, Software Development Kits, and Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, for software applicationsand game titles that are optimized for our platforms. Our Deep Learning Institute provides in-person and online trainingfor developers in industries and organizations around the world to build AI and accelerated computing applications thatleverage our GPU and CUDA platforms. We now have over 1.6 million registered developers across our platforms, includingaccelerated computing, gaming, deep learning, autonomous machines, and others.As NVIDIA’s business has evolved from a focus primarily on gaming products to broader markets, and from chips to platformsand complete systems, so, too, have our avenues to market. Thus, in addition to sales to customers in our partner network,certain of our platforms are also sold through e-tail channels, or direct to cloud service providers and enterprise customers.Sales to Dell Technologies Inc., or Dell, accounted for 11% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020.Backlog Our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders. The quantity of products purchased by our customersas well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers' requirements andin manufacturing availability. Our industry is characterized by relatively short lead time orders and delivery schedules,thus, we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is non-cancelable and that the dollar amount associated with thenon-cancelable portion is not significant.SeasonalityOur GPU and Tegra processor platforms serve many markets from consumer PC gaming to enterprise workstations togovernment and cloud service provider data centers, although a majority of our revenue stems from the consumer industry.Our consumer products typically see stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. In addition, based on theproduction schedules of key customers, some of our products for notebooks or game consoles typically generate strongerrevenue in the second and third quarters, and weaker revenue in the fourth and first quarters. However, there can be noassurance that this trend will continue. Manufacturing We do not directly manufacture semiconductors used for our products. Instead, we utilize a fabless manufacturing strategy,whereby we employ world-class suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including wafer fabrication,assembly, testing, and packaging. This strategy uses the expertise of industry-leading suppliers that are certified by theInternational Organization for Standardization in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance,reliability, and testing. Additionally, we can avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operatingmanufacturing operations. While we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products,such as substrates and a variety of components, our suppliers are responsible for procurement of the majority of the rawmaterials used in the production of our products. As a result, we can focus our resources on product design, additionalquality assurance, marketing, and customer support.We utilize industry-leading suppliers, such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited and SamsungElectronics Co. Ltd, to produce our semiconductor wafers. We then utilize independent subcontractors, such as AdvancedSemiconductor Engineering, Inc., Amkor Technology, BYD Auto Co. Ltd., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd., JSI LogisticsLtd., King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd., and Siliconware Precision Industries Company Ltd. to perform assembly, testing, andpackaging of most of our products and platforms. We purchase substrates from IbidenCo. Ltd., Kinsus InterconnectTechnology Corporation, and Unimicron Technology Corporation, and memory from Micron Technology, SamsungSemiconductor, Inc., and SK Hynix.We typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors, perform incoming quality assurance andconfiguration, and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers, or CEMs, distributors, motherboardand AIB customers from our third-party warehouse in Hong Kong. Generally, these manufacturers assemble and test theboards based on our design kit and test specifications, and then ship our products to retailers, system builders, or OEMsas motherboard and AIB solutions.We also utilize industry-leading contract manufacturers, or CMs, such as BYD and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., and ODMssuch as Quanta Computer and Wistron Corporation, to manufacture some of our products for sale directly to end customers.In those cases, key elements such as the GPU, SoC and memory are often consigned by us to the CMs, who are responsiblefor the procurement of other components used in the production process.9Working CapitalWe focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other working-capital-related items. We manageinventories by communicating with our customers and partners and then using our industry experience to forecast demandon a platform-by-platform basis. We then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand.We generally maintain substantial inventories of our products. A substantial amount of our inventories is maintained assemi-finished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demands.Our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances increased by 47% to $10.90 billion at the end offiscal year 2020 compared with the end of fiscal year 2019.Competition The market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolvingindustry standards. We believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance, breadth of productofferings, access to customers and partners and distribution channels, software support, conformity to industry standardAPIs, manufacturing capabilities, processor pricing, and total system costs. We believe that our ability to remain competitivewill depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand andwhether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices.We expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may belower priced than ours, or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products. In addition,it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share.A significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide GPUs, embedded SOCs, andother accelerated and AI computing processor products. Some of our competitors may have greater marketing, financial,distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes.Our current competitors include:•suppliers and licensors designing discrete and integrated GPUs and other accelerated computing solutions, includingchipsets that incorporate 3D graphics, or HPC, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, Intel Corporation, or Intel,and Xilinx, Inc.;•large internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporates HPC or acceleratedcomputing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alphabet Inc.; and•suppliers of SoC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, suchas Ambarella, Inc., AMD, Broadcom Inc., Intel, Qualcomm Incorporated, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung,and Xilinx, Inc. or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for internal use, such as Tesla Motors.Patents and Proprietary RightsWe rely primarily on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosureagreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally. Ourcurrently issued patents have expiration dates from March 2020 to October 2039. We have numerous patents issued,allowed, and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarilyrelate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products. We also rely on international treaties,organizations, and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property. The laws of certain foreign countries in which ourproducts are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectualproperty rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility ofpiracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protectionfor particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:•the location in which our products are manufactured;•our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;•the degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and•the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors' operations in particular countries and regions.We have also licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.EmployeesAs of January 26, 2020, we had 13,775 employees, 9,823 of whom were engaged in research and development and 3,952of whom were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative positions. 10Environmental Regulatory ComplianceTo date, we have not incurred significant expenses related to environmental regulatory compliance matters.

RISK FACTORSIn evaluating NVIDIA and our business, the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K. Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involvesrisks including, but not limited to, the risks described below. Any one of the following risks could harm our business, financialcondition, results of operations or reputation, which could cause our stock price to decline, and you may lose all or a part of yourinvestment. Additional risks, trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial mayalso harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or reputation.Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and PartnersIf we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets, or identify new products, services or technologies, our revenue andfinancial results may be adversely impacted.We created GPU-based visual and accelerated computing platforms that address four large markets: Gaming, ProfessionalVisualization, Data Center, and Automotive. These markets often experience rapid technological change, changes incustomer requirements, new product introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards. Our successdepends on our ability to identify emerging industry changes and to develop new (or enhance our existing) products, servicesand technologies that meet the evolving needs of these markets. Such activities may require considerable technical,financial, compliance, sales and marketing investments. We devote significant resources to the development of technologiesand business offerings in markets where we have a limited operating history, such as the automotive and data centermarkets, which presents additional risks to our business. We must also continue to develop the infrastructure needed toscale our business in these areas, including customer service and support. We also must meet customer safety andcompliance standards, which are subject to change. Additionally, we continue to make considerable investments in researchand development, which may not produce significant revenue for several years, if at all. If our investments are unsuccessfuland we fail to develop new products, services and technologies, or if we focus on technologies that do not become widelyadopted, our business, revenue, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We cannot assureyou that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers,partners and ultimately, our shareholders. If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emergingtechnology trends, or if we do not appropriately adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve, in a timely manner toexploit potential market opportunities, our business will be harmed.Competition in our current and target markets could prevent us from growing our revenue.Our target markets remain extremely competitive, and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expandtheir product and/or service offerings, industry standards continue to evolve, customer needs change and new competitorsenter these markets. Our competitors’ products, services and technologies may be less costly, or may offer superiorfunctionality or better features, than ours, which may result, among other things, in lower than expected selling prices forour products. In addition, some of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities, have longer operatinghistories, larger customer bases, more comprehensive intellectual property, or IP, portfolios and patent protections, andgreater financial, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. These competitors may be able to more effectivelyidentify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends, quickly transition their products,including semiconductor products, to increasingly smaller line width geometries, and obtain sufficient foundry capacityand packaging materials, which could harm our business. If we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets,respond to changes in our target markets or introduce new offerings to meet the needs of this competitive environment,including in significant international markets such as China, demand for our products, services and technologies coulddecrease, which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our results of operations to suffer.  In addition, the competitivelandscape in our target markets has changed and may continue to evolve due to a trend toward consolidation, which couldlead to fewer customers, partners, or suppliers, any of which could negatively affect our financial results.System security and data protection breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce ourexpected revenue and increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation.Security breaches, computer malware, phishing, and cyber-attacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recentyears. These threats are constantly evolving, making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them orimplement adequate preventative measures. These attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected tooccur in the future. Experienced computer programmers, hackers and employees may penetrate our security controls andmisappropriate or compromise our confidential information, or that of our employees or third parties. These attacks maycreate system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These hackers may also develop and deploy viruses, worms and othermalicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products, including consumerand automotive products, where we utilize over-the-air updates to improve functionality over time. For portions of our ITinfrastructure, including business management and communication software products, we rely on products and servicesprovided by third parties. These providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impactour systems. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, such as actions by an employee withaccess to our systems. To defend against security threats, both to our internal systems and those of our customers, wemust continuously engineer more secure products and enhance security and reliability features, which may result inincreased expenses.Actual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproveddissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our partners, our customers or thirdparties could expose us and the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation andpotential liability, paying damages, regulatory inquiries or actions, damage to our brand and reputation or other harm toour business. Our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful.We may experience interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers. Such disruptionscould adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions. Delayed sales, lower margins orlost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.We depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture, assemble, test and/or package our products, whichreduces our control over product quantity and quality, manufacturing yields, development, enhancement and productdelivery schedule and could harm our business.We do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our GPUs and Tegra processors and do not own or operate a waferfabrication facility. Instead, we are dependent on industry-leading foundries, such as Taiwan Semiconductor ManufacturingCompany Limited and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabricationequipment and techniques. Similarly, we do not directly assemble, test or package our products, but instead rely onindependent subcontractors. We do not have long-term commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors. Asa result, we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and/or negatively impact our business operations, gross margin, revenue and/or financial results, including:•a lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices dueto supply constraints;•a failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate or any manufacturing or testcapacity for our products;•a failure to develop, obtain or successfully implement high quality, leading-edge process technologies, includingtransitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as advanced process node technologies and memorydesigns needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis;•a limited number of suppliers, including foundries, assembly and test providers, and memory manufacturers;•loss of a supplier and additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry orsubcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or changea supplier;•a lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality; and•delays in product shipments, shortages, a decrease in product quality and/or higher expenses in the event oursubcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors’ orders over our orders or otherwise.In addition, low manufacturing yields could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand, increasemanufacturing costs, harm customer or partner relationships, and/or negatively impact our business operations, grossmargin, revenue and/or financial results. Manufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design, which isdeveloped largely by us, and process technology, which typically is proprietary to the foundry. Low yields may result fromeither product design or process technology failure. We do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design isactually manufactured by the foundry. As a result, yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturingprocess and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem. We also rely on third-party software development tools to assist us in the design, simulation and verification of new productsor product enhancements, and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner. In the past,we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available13software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products. The designrequirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products mayexceed the capabilities of available software development tools. If we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to theunavailability of such software development tools, we could lose market share and our revenues could decline. If we failto achieve design wins for our products, our business will be harmed.For our products that we do not sell directly to consumers, achieving design wins is an important success factor. Achievingdesign wins may involve a lengthy process in pursuit of a customer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipatefeatures and functionality that customers and consumers will demand. Failure to obtain a particular design win may preventus from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This could result in lost revenue and couldweaken our position in future competitive bid selection processes. Unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by majorhardware manufacturers and software developers. Further, if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industrystandards, including safety standards, our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies. Winninga product design does not guarantee sales to a customer or that we will realize as much revenue as anticipated, if any.If our products contain significant defects, we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects, our reputationcould be damaged, and we could lose market share.Our products are complex and may contain defects or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactoryperformance due to any number of issues in design, fabrication, packaging, materials and/or use within a system. Theserisks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices, markets, technologies and applications, including intothe automotive market, or as new versions are released. Some errors in our products or services may only be discoveredafter a product or service has been shipped or used by customers or the end users of such product. Undiscoveredvulnerabilities in our products or services could expose our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous thirdparties who develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products orservices. Failure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, could lead to substantial damageto the products we sell directly to customers, the end product in which our device has been integrated by OEMs, ODMs, AIBsand Tier 1 automotive suppliers, and to the user of such end product. Any such defect may cause us to incur significantwarranty, support and repair or replacement costs, write off the value of related inventory, cause us to lose market share,and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue.In addition, an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercialshipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins, harm our relationships with customersand partners and harm consumers’ perceptions of our brand. Also, we may be required to reimburse our customers,partners or consumers, including costs to repair or replace products in the field. A product recall, including automotiverecalls or a recall due to a bug in our products, or a significant number of product returns could be expensive, damage ourreputation, harm our ability to attract new customers, result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result inlitigation against us, such as product liability suits. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defendingthe claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm ourbusiness. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptableterms, which could adversely impact our financial results.Business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costs.Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages,outages at cloud service providers, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, cyber-attacks,terrorist attacks, medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or man-made disasters, catastrophic events or climatechange. The occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline inrevenue and an increase in our costs and expenses. Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expendituresand recovery time in order to fully resume operations. Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research anddevelopment activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and someof our suppliers are located in Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. In addition, a large portion ofour current data center capacity is located in California, making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or otherbusiness disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. The manufacture of product components, the final assemblyof our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan, China,Hong Kong, and Korea. Additionally, a significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through HongKong. Geopolitical change or changes in government regulations and policies in the United States or abroad may result inchanging regulatory requirements, trade policies, import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operatingstrategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. In particular, revisions to laws or regulations14or their interpretation and enforcement could result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import dutiesor tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse effecton our business plans. For example, regulations to implement the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 could have an adverseeffect on our business plans. Catastrophic events can also have an impact on third-party vendors who provide us criticalinfrastructure services for IT and research and development systems and personnel. Our operations could be harmed ifmanufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters,high heat events or water shortages, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor,environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries and othersuppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certaingeographical areas is unknown. In the event a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or thethird-party systems on which we rely, our business could be harmed as a result of declines in revenue, increases in expenses,substantial expenditures and time spent to fully resume operations.In January 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus was identified in China, resulting in shutdowns of manufacturing andcommerce, as well as global travel restrictions to contain the virus. The impact has extended to other regions. We haveoperations and employees in China, and the region represents an important end market for our products. Our customersand suppliers within China and neighboring countries are also affected by the coronavirus related restrictions and closures.The coronavirus is expected to have a negative effect on our financial results, though the full extent and duration is uncertainand could have a material negative impact on our business. If we fail to estimate customer demand properly, our financial results could be harmed.We manufacture our GPUs and Tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand and requirements. We sell manyof our products through a channel model, and our channel customers sell to retailers, distributors, and/or end customers.As a result, the decisions made by our channel partners, retailers, and distributors in response to changing market conditionsand the changing demand for our products could impact our financial results.  In order to have shorter shipment lead timesand quicker delivery schedules for our customers, we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do notoccur, may build inventory anticipating demand that does not materialize, or may build inventory to serve what we believeis pent-up demand.  Such decisions may and have resulted in prolonged channel sell-through, as we experienced with ourmid-range gaming GPUs in fiscal year 2019. In estimating demand, we make multiple assumptions, any of which may proveto be incorrect. Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include:•changes in business and economic conditions, including downturns in our target markets and/or overall economy;•changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions, including changes in the credit market;•a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products;•a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;•our introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products; •less demand than expected for newly-introduced products; or•increased competition, including competitive pricing actions.The cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory, which could adverselyaffect our gross margins. In addition, because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of eachquarter, we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customercancellations or deferrals. We could be required to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or market or write-offexcess inventory, and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand,any of which could harm our financial results.Conversely, if we underestimate our customers' demand for our products, our foundry partners may not have adequatelead-time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers' orderson a timely basis. We may also face supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events. In such cases, even ifwe are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand, we may not be able to do so in a cost-effective ortimely manner. If we fail to fulfill our customers' orders on a timely basis, or at all, our customer relationships could bedamaged, we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged.We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network and ourrevenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our distribution and partnernetwork. With several of these distributors and partners, we are selling multiple target market platforms through theirchannels. For fiscal year 2020, 11% of our total revenue was from one customer, Dell. Our operating results in the foreseeable15future will continue to depend on sales within our partner network, as well as the ability of these partners to sell productsthat incorporate our GPUs and Tegra processors. In the future, these partners may decide to purchase fewer products thanthey did in the past, not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem, or to alter their purchasing patterns in some otherway, particularly because:•most of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, which permits our customers to cancel, change or delayproduct purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penalty;•our partners may develop their own solutions;•our customers may purchase products from our competitors; or•our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products.We could also be restricted from selling our products or providing our technology and services due to U.S. trade restrictions.The loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, or our inability to sell to a customerdue to U.S. trade restrictions would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations, and any difficulties incollecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition.We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our customersto make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers. In thefuture, we may have to record additional provisions or write-offs and/or defer revenue on certain sales transactions, whichcould negatively impact our financial results, and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extendto these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient.We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, which may harm our business.We conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the United States. Our semiconductorwafers are manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States. We alsogenerate a significant portion of our revenue from sales outside the United States. We allocate revenue to individual countriesbased on the location to which the products are initially billed even if our customers’ revenue is attributable to end customersthat are located in a different location. Revenue from sales outside of the United States accounted for 92% of total revenuefor fiscal year 2020, and 87% for each of fiscal years 2019 and 2018. Revenue from billings to China, including Hong Kong,was 25% of our revenue for fiscal year 2020, even if our customers' revenue is attributable to end customers that arelocated in a different location. Additionally, as of January 26, 2020, approximately 46% of our employees were locatedoutside of the United States. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, whichcould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including:•international economic and political conditions, including as a result of the United Kingdom's vote to withdraw fromthe European Union, and other political tensions between countries in which we do business;•unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws;•differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices;•local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practicesthat we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption laws andregulations;•exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions, including deemed export restrictions, tariffs,quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions; •disruptions of capital and trading markets and currency fluctuations; and•increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations, such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, andpollution limits.If our sales outside of the United States are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may benegatively impacted.If we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, we may not be able to execute ourbusiness strategy effectively. To be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully, we must attract, retain and motivate our executives andkey employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. In particular,hiring qualified executives, scientists, engineers, technical staff and research and development personnel is critical to ourbusiness. Additionally, changes in immigration and work permit laws and regulations or the administration or interpretationof such laws or regulations could impair our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. If we are less successful16in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products andservices may be adversely affected. Additionally, competition for personnel results in increased costs in the form of cashand stock-based compensation. The interpretation and application of employment related laws to our workforce practicesmay result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Effective successionplanning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitionsinvolving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategicinvestments, including the Mellanox acquisition, and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets,which could hurt our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products.We have in the past acquired and invested in, and may continue to acquire and invest in, other businesses that offer products,services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products, strategic objectives andbusiness. In March 2019, we announced our agreement to acquire Mellanox for approximately $6.9 billion. The Mellanoxacquisition and other past or future acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks, and could impairour ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, and ultimately could have a negative impacton our growth or our financial results. Given that our resources are limited, our decision to pursue a transaction hasopportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering intoother transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives. Additional risks related to the Mellanox acquisition,and other acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:•difficulty in combining the technology, products, operations or workforce of the acquired business with our business;•diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;•assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs ofacquired assets;•integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;•coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated;•difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return, if at all;•difficulty in obtaining regulatory, other approvals or financing;•failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment;•legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;•uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;•negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;•the need to later divest acquired assets if an acquisition does not meet our expectations;•potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or company;and•impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target’s, employees, vendors and customers, as a result ofour acquisition or investment.Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Common Stock and Other MattersActions to adequately protect our IP rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could beharmed if we are unsuccessful in doing so or if we are prohibited from making or selling our products.We have in the past, currently are, and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings allegingpatent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us, our employees or parties that we have agreed toindemnify for certain claims of infringement. An unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation couldinclude significant damages, invalidation of a patent or family of patents, indemnification of customers, payment of lostprofits, or, when it has been sought, injunctive relief. Claims that our products or processes infringe the IP rights of others,regardless of their merit, could cause us to incur significant costs to respond to, defend, and resolve such claims, and theymay also divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel.We may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights. Such proceedingsmay increase our operating expenses, which could negatively impact our operating results. Further, we could be subjectto countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation. If infringement claims are made against us or our products arefound to infringe a third party’s patent or intellectual property, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license tothe third party’s patent or other intellectual property rights. However, we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or onterms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors. If we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from17a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products, we could be subject to substantial liabilitiesor have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to makeroyalty or other payments, or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commerciallyreasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or otherindemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results.Our success depends in part on protecting our intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely primarily on a combinationof patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing arrangements, andthe laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the United States and internationally.We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights, and even withsignificant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights that are valuable to our business.The laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as thelaws of the United States. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. In addition, thetheft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm ourcompetitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in research anddevelopment, product development, and marketing could be reduced. We continuously assess whether and where to seekformal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies, but cannot be certain whether our applications forsuch protections will be approved, and, if approved, whether we will be able to enforce such protections.Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are belowthe expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.Our operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors.Therefore, investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our futureperformance.Factors, other than those described elsewhere in these risk factors, that could affect our results of operations in the futureinclude, but are not limited to:•our ability to achieve volume production of our next-generation products;•our inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to the multi-year development cycle for some of ourproducts and services;•fluctuations in the demand for our products related to cryptocurrencies; •changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our partners’ products;• our ability to cover the manufacturing and design costs of our products through competitive pricing;•our ability to comply and continue to comply with our customers’ contractual obligations;•product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues;•our ability to secure appropriate safety certifications and meet industry safety standards;•supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our products •inventory write-downs;•our ability to continue generating revenue from our partner network, including by generating sales within our partnernetwork and ensuring our products are incorporated into our partners product ecosystems, and our partner network’sability to sell products that incorporate our GPUs and Tegra processors;•the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments to us, and our ability to obtain credit insuranceover the purchasing credit extended to these customers;•customer bad debt write-offs;•any unanticipated costs associated with environmental liabilities;•unexpected costs related to our ownership of real property;•changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards; and•general macroeconomic or industry events and factors affecting the overall market and our target markets.Any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results. Anysuch failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock priceto decline or experience substantial price volatility.18Privacy concerns relating to our products and services could damage our reputation, deter current and potential usersfrom using our products and services, result in liability, or result in legal or regulatory proceedings.Our products and services may provide us with access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that issubject to privacy and security laws and regulations. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use,retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could damageour reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored,or transferred by us to run our business or by one of our partners could result in significantly increased security costs,damage to our reputation, regulatory proceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased costs related todefending legal claims.Worldwide regulatory authorities are considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning dataprotection, which continue to evolve and apply to our business. For example, the European Union adopted the General DataProtection Regulation, or GDPR, which requires companies to meet new requirements effective as of May 2018 regardingthe handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct ordelete such data about themselves. Failure to meet GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwiderevenue. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europeand elsewhere are often uncertain and fluid, and may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with ourdata practices. If so, we may be ordered to change our data practices and/or be fined. Complying with these changing lawshas caused, and could continue to cause, us to incur substantial costs, which could have an adverse effect on our businessand results of operations. Further, failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or ordersto stop the alleged noncompliant activity.We may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by higher thanexpected tax rates.As a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, such as payroll, sales,use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes, in both the United States and various foreignjurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenue and expenses in differentjurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other taxliabilities. Further, changes in United States federal, and state or international tax laws applicable to multinationalcorporations or other fundamental law changes may materially impact our tax expense and cash flows, as we experiencedin fiscal year 2018 with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA.Our future effective tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws, changes in our business or statutoryrates, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in available tax credits,the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, changes in United States generally accepted accounting principles,adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns, increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, changesin the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and in deferred tax valuation allowances, changing interpretationof existing laws or regulations, the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation and the recognition of excess taxbenefits and tax deficiencies within the income tax provision in the period in which they occur, the impact of accounting forbusiness combinations, shifts in the amount of earnings in the United States compared with other regions in the world andoverall levels of income before tax, changes in our international organization, as well as the expiration of statute of limitationsand settlements of audits. Any changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.Our business is exposed to the risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.We currently and may in the future face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/orinvestigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business on a global basis.For example, multiple securities litigation claims have recently been filed against us and certain of our officers based onthe dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact ofcryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. In addition, a stockholder, purporting to act on behalf of the Company, filed aderivative lawsuit seeking to assert claims on behalf of the Company against the members of our board of directors andcertain officers based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory andthe impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, including monetarydamages, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products, engaging in certain businesspractices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An unfavorable outcome or settlementmay result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. Inaddition, regardless of the outcome, litigation can be costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations. 19In addition, the laws and regulations our business is subject to are complex and change frequently. We may be required toincur significant expense to comply with changes in, or remedy violations of, these laws and regulations.Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our agreement with Microsoft Corporationcould delay or prevent a change in control.Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law maydiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interestedshareholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested shareholder, even if a change of controlwould be beneficial to our existing shareholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisionsthat could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. These provisionsinclude the following:•the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approval;•the prohibition of shareholder action by written consent;•advance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder proposals;•the ability of our Board of Directors to increase or decrease the number of directors without shareholder approval;•a super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;•the inability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders; and•the ability of our Board of Directors to make, amend or repeal our bylaws.On March 5, 2000, we entered into an agreement with Microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips andto license certain technology to Microsoft and its licensees for use in the Xbox. Under the agreement, if an individual orcorporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30% of the outstanding shares of our commonstock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock. The Microsoft provision and the other factorslisted above could also delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA. These provisions could also discourage proxy contestsand make it more difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporateactions they desire.20ITEM 1B.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUERPURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIESOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NVDA. Public trading of our commonstock began on January 22, 1999. Prior to that, there was no public market for our common stock. As of February 14, 2020,we had approximately 301 registered shareholders, not including those shares held in street or nominee name. Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesBeginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock. Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares for a totalcost of $7.08 billion through January 26, 2020. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasurystock.As of January 26, 2020, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock upto $7.24 billion through December 2022.The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchaseprograms, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases, in compliance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities ExchangeAct of 1934, as amended, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other factors. The program doesnot obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time atour discretion.In November 2018, we communicated our intent to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020,including $700 million in share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2020, wereturned $390 million in quarterly cash dividends. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2020. We intend toreturn to repurchasing shares after closing the acquisition of Mellanox.Restricted Stock Unit Share WithholdingWe also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations uponthe vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our employee equity incentive program.

Selected Financial Data”, our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notesthereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, beforedeciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock. OverviewOur Company and Our BusinessesNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Starting with a focuson PC graphics, we extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI. Fueled by the sustained demand forexceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms forVR, HPC, and AI.Our two reportable segments - GPU and Tegra Processor - are based on a single underlying graphics architecture. Fromour proprietary processors, we have created platforms that address four large markets where our expertise is critical:Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Center, and Automotive.Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla andDGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brandincorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as forgame consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delawarein April 1998. Recent Developments, Future Objectives and ChallengesFiscal Year 2020 SummaryYear EndedJanuary 26,  2020January 27,  2019Change($ in millions, except per share data)Revenue.........................................................................................................................$10,918$11,716Down 7%Gross margin................................................................................................................62.0%61.2%Up 80 bpsOperating expenses....................................................................................................$3,922$3,367Up 16%Income from operations...........................................................................................$2,846$3,804Down 25%Net income....................................................................................................................$2,796$4,141Down 32%Net income per diluted share..................................................................................$4.52$6.63Down 32%Revenue for fiscal year 2020 was $10.92 billion, down 7% from a year earlier. GPU business revenue was $9.47 billion,down 7% from a year earlier. Tegra Processor business revenue - which includes Automotive, SoCs for gaming platforms,and embedded edge AI platforms - was $1.45 billion, down 6% from a year earlier.From a market platform perspective, Gaming revenue was $5.52 billion, down 12% from a year ago, reflecting lower salesof GeForce desktop GPUs and SoCs for gaming platforms, partially offset by growth in GeForce notebook GPUs.Professional Visualization revenue was $1.21 billion, up 7% from a year ago, reflecting strength in desktop and notebookworkstations.Data Center revenue was $2.98 billion, up 2% from a year ago, driven by vertical industry growth partially offset by lowerhyperscale sales.Automotive revenue was $700 million, up 9% from a year ago, reflecting growth in AI cockpit solutions and developmentservices agreements.   24OEM and Other revenue was $505 million, down 34% from a year ago, primarily due to the absence of cryptocurrency-specific product sales.Gross margin for fiscal year 2020 was 62.0%, up 80 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by reduced inventoryprovisions and the sale of previously written-off components. Operating expenses for fiscal year 2020 were $3.92 billion, up 16% from a year ago, reflecting primarily employee additionsand increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including stock-based compensation and infrastructurecosts. Income from operations for fiscal year 2020 was $2.85 billion, down 25% from a year earlier. Net income and net incomeper diluted share for fiscal year 2020 were $2.80 billion and $4.52, respectively, both down 32% from a year earlier reflectinglower revenue and higher operating expenses.On March 10, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Mellanox TechnologiesLtd., or Mellanox, pursuant to which we will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Mellanox for $125per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $6.9 billion as of the date of the Merger Agreement.The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. The consummation of the mergeris conditioned on the receipt of the approval of Mellanox shareholders, as well as the satisfaction of other customary closingconditions, including domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and performance in all material respects by each party ofits obligations under the Merger Agreement. In June 2019, Mellanox shareholders approved the consummation of themerger and we received regulatory approvals for the deal from Mexico in July 2019 and from the European Commissionin December 2019. In addition, the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, asamended, in connection with the proposed acquisition expired in May 2019. Discussions with China's regulatory agency,the State Administration for Market Regulation, are progressing and we believe the acquisition will likely close in the earlypart of calendar 2020. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtainthe required regulatory approvals, we could be obligated to pay Mellanox a termination fee of $350 million.In November 2018, we communicated our intent to return $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020,including $700 million in share repurchases made during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. In fiscal year 2020, wereturned $390 million in quarterly cash dividends. We did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year 2020. We intend toreturn to repurchasing shares after closing the acquisition of Mellanox.Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $10.90 billion as of January 26, 2020, compared with $7.42 billionas of January 27, 2019. The increase primarily reflects growth in operating cash flow.In January 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus was identified in China, resulting in shutdowns of manufacturing andcommerce, as well as global travel restrictions to contain the virus. The impact has extended to other regions. We  haveoperations and employees in China, and the region represents an important end market for our products. Our customersand suppliers within China and neighboring countries are also affected by the coronavirus related restrictions and closures.The coronavirus is expected to have a negative effect on our financial results, though the full extent and duration is uncertainand could have a material negative impact on our business. GPU BusinessIn Gaming, we extended NVIDIA’s family of Turing-based GPUs with the GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, GTX 1660 and GTX 1650, aswell as with our new SUPER line, including the GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER, RTX 2070 SUPER, RTX 2060 SUPER, GTX 1660SUPER, and GTX 1650 SUPER; and accelerated momentum of ray-tracing games by supporting a growing list of titles;introduced new RTX Studio laptops powered by GeForce RTX and Quadro RTX GPUs for online and studio-based creativesand prosumer customers; unveiled two new models of the SHIELD TV streaming media player; and introduced two newservice offerings for GeForce NOW cloud gaming service. In Professional Visualization, we expanded adoption of NVIDIA RTX ray-tracing technology by 3D application providers;rolled out a full range of Turing-based Quadro GPUs for mobile workstations, incorporating ray tracing for product design,architecture, effects and scientific visualization; and unveiled the NVIDIA Omniverse open-collaboration platform to simplifycreative workflows for content creation. In Data Center, we introduced the NVIDIA CUDA-X AI platform for accelerating data science; announced availability of NVIDIAT4 Tensor Core GPUs from leading OEMs and cloud service providers; unveiled the DGX SuperPOD; and announced supportfor Arm CPUs, providing a new path to build AI-enabled exascale supercomputers, as well as a collaboration with Arm andothers on a reference design for GPU accelerated Arm-based servers. We launched the NVIDIA EGX Intelligent EdgeComputing Platform, bringing accelerated AI to vertical industries; and announced a collaboration to integrate Microsoft25Azure with EGX, as well as plans for a scalable GPU-accelerated supercomputer in the Microsoft Azure cloud. Additionally,we entered the 5G telecom market, enabling telcos to build efficient, virtualized 5G RANs; announced a collaboration todeliver software-defined 5G RAN; and announced that Alibaba and Baidu’s recommendation engines run on NVIDIA AI.Tegra Processor BusinessIn our Automotive platform, we announced a partnership with Toyota Research Institute-Advanced Development to develop,train and validate self-driving vehicles; unveiled the NVIDIA DRIVE AP2X automated driving solution, encompassing DRIVEAutoPilot software, DRIVE AGX and DRIVE validation tools; introduced the NVIDIA DRIVE AV Safety Force Field to enablesafe, comfortable driving experiences; and announced availability of the NVIDIA DRIVE Constellation autonomous vehiclesimulation platform.26Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesManagement’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidatedfinancial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the UnitedStates, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affectthe reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. Onan on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to inventories, revenue recognition, income taxes,and goodwill. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to bereasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying valuesof assets and liabilities.We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparationof our consolidated financial statements. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these criticalaccounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewedour disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.InventoriesInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizablevalue or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-off ofexcess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitmentscompared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions.Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions, changesin market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because ofchanging technology and customer requirements, failure to estimate customer demand properly, or unexpected competitivepricing actions by our competition. In addition, cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in ourholding excess inventory.The overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down wasinsignificant in fiscal year 2020 and an unfavorable impact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019. The charges we took to cost of salesfor inventory provisions during fiscal year 2019 were primarily related to excess DRAM, other components, and priorarchitecture components and chips. As a fabless semiconductor company, we must make commitments to purchaseinventory based on forecasts of future customer demand. In doing so, we must account for our third-party manufacturers'lead times and constraints. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by ourcompetitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for furtherdiscussion.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, andsoftware licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with acustomer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4)allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, oras, we satisfy a performance obligation.Product Sales RevenueRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount thatreflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Revenue is recognized net of allowancesfor returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance forestimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if productreturns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales returnallowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products invarious target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that areearmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promotingNVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFsbased on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.License and Development ArrangementsOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectualproperty components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development servicesas a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progressto completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete eachproject. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.Income TaxesWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundablein the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, asappropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we recorda valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidenceand judgment, are not expected to be realized.Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing withuncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based,in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the UnitedStates, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognizeliabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extentto which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recordedtax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional incometax expense in our financial statements accordingly.As of January 26, 2020, we had a valuation allowance of $621 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assetsthat management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income andpotential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realizationof the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income taxbenefit during the period.We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained uponaudit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related tounrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form10-K for additional information.GoodwillGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier, if indicators ofpotential impairment exist, using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment. Our impairment review process comparesthe fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value. We have identified two reporting units,27GPU and Tegra Processor, for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis. Goodwill assigned to the GPU and TegraProcessor reporting units as of January 26, 2020 was $210 million and $408 million, respectively. Determining the fairvalue of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Wealso make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units. We base our fairvalue estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.We performed our annual goodwill assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 using a qualitative assessmentand concluded there was no goodwill impairment.Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.28Results of OperationsA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2019 comparedto fiscal year 2018 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 27,2019, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2019, which is available free of charge on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.govand at our investor relations website, http://investor.nvidia.com.The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain items in our Consolidated Statements of Income expressedas a percentage of revenue. Year EndedJanuary 26,  2020January 27,  2019Revenue...............................................................................................................................................100.0%100.0%Cost of revenue............................................................................................................................38.038.8Gross profit.........................................................................................................................................62.061.2Operating expenses:Research and development.....................................................................................................25.920.3Sales, general and administrative.........................................................................................10.08.5Total operating expenses...............................................................................................................35.928.7Income from operations.................................................................................................................26.132.5Interest income............................................................................................................................1.61.2Interest expense..........................................................................................................................(0.5)(0.5)Other, net.......................................................................................................................................—0.1Total other income................................................................................................................1.10.8Income before income tax expense............................................................................................27.233.3Income tax expense (benefit)........................................................................................................1.6(2.1)Net income.........................................................................................................................................25.6%35.3%RevenueRevenue by Reportable SegmentsYear EndedJanuary 26,  2020January 27,  2019$Change%Change($ in millions)GPU.................................................................................................$9,465$10,175$(710)(7)%Tegra Processor.........................................................................1,4531,541(88)(6)%Total................................................................................................$10,918$11,716$(798)(7)%GPU Business. GPU business revenue decreased by 7% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, which reflects adecline in GPUs sold for gaming. GeForce GPU product sales for gaming decreased by 10%, reflecting lower sales of GeForcedesktop GPUs and SoCs for gaming platforms, partially offset by growth in GeForce notebook GPUs. Revenue from QuadroGPUs for professional visualization increased by 7%, reflecting strength in desktop and notebook workstations. Data Centerrevenue, which includes Tesla, GRID and DGX, increased by 2%, driven by vertical industry growth partially offset by lowerhyperscale sales.Tegra Processor Business.  Tegra Processor business revenue decreased by 6% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscalyear 2019. This was driven by a decline in revenue from SoCs for gaming platforms, which was partially offset by an increaseof 9% in Automotive revenue, reflecting growth in AI cockpit solutions and development services agreements.   Concentration of RevenueRevenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 92% and 87% of total revenue for fiscal years2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location towhich the products are initially billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.Dell represented approximately 11% of our total revenue for fiscal year 2020 and was attributable to the GPU business. Nocustomer represented 10% or more of total revenue for fiscal year 2019.Gross Profit and Gross MarginGross profit consists of total revenue, net of allowances, less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the costof semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, boardand device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final testyield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue alsoincludes development costs for license and service arrangements and stock-based compensation related to personnelassociated with manufacturing. Our overall gross margin was 62.0% and 61.2% for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in fiscal year2020 was driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components. Inventory provisions totaled $161 million and $270 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Sales of inventorythat was previously written-off or written-down totaled $145 million and $41 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019,respectively. As a result, the overall net effect on our gross margin was insignificant in fiscal year 2020 and an unfavorableimpact of 2.0% in fiscal year 2019.A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows: GPU Business. The gross margin of our GPU business increased during fiscal year 2020 when compared to fiscal year2019, primarily driven by reduced inventory provisions and the sale of previously written-off components.Tegra Processor Business. The gross margin of our Tegra Processor business was relatively flat during fiscal year 2020when compared to fiscal year 2019.Operating ExpensesYear EndedJanuary 26,  2020January 27,  2019$Change%Change($ in millions)Research and development expenses.................................$2,829$2,376$45319%% of net revenue..........................................................................25.9%20.3%Sales, general and administrative expenses.....................1,09399110210%% of net revenue..........................................................................10.0%8.5%Total operating expenses...................................................$3,922$3,367$55516%Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expenses increased by 19% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, driven primarilyby employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costsand stock-based compensation expense.29Sales, General and AdministrativeSales, general and administrative expenses increased by 10% in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, drivenprimarily by employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructurecosts and stock-based compensation expense. Total Other Income, NetInterest Income and Interest ExpenseInterest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $178million and $136 million in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily due tohigher average invested balances.Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the 2.20% Notes Due2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026 issued in September 2016. Interest expense was $52 million and $58 million in fiscal years2020 and 2019, respectively.Other, NetOther, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from non-affiliated investments and the impact ofchanges in foreign currency rates. Other, net, was not significant during fiscal year 2020 and was $14 million of incomeduring fiscal year 2019, consisting primarily of $12 million unrealized gains from non-affiliated investments. Income TaxesWe recognized income tax expense of $174 million for fiscal year 2020 and income tax benefit of $245 million for fiscalyear 2019. Our annual effective tax rate was 5.9% and (6.3)% for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase inour effective tax rate in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a decrease of tax benefitsfrom stock-based compensation and an absence of tax benefits related to the enactment of the TCJA.Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily toincome earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than theU.S. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits, excess tax benefits related tostock-based compensation, and the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA in 2019.Refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.30Liquidity and Capital Resources January 26,  2020January 27,  2019(In millions)Cash and cash equivalents......................................................................................................................$10,896$782Marketable securities...............................................................................................................................16,640Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.........................................................................$10,897$7,422Year EndedJanuary 26,  2020January 27,  2019(In millions)Net cash provided by operating activities...........................................................................................$4,761$3,743Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities..........................................................................$6,145$(4,097)Net cash used in financing activities....................................................................................................$(792)$(2,866)As of January 26, 2020, we had $10.90 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $3.48billion from the end of fiscal year 2019. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities,the diversification of investment types and credit exposures, and certain limits on our portfolio duration.Cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to changesin working capital driven by a reduction in inventory, partially offset by a decrease in operating income.Cash used in investing activities decreased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to lower purchases,higher sales, and lower maturities of marketable securities in preparation for the acquisition of Mellanox.Cash used in financing activities decreased in fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, primarily due to no sharerepurchases in fiscal year 2020 and lower tax payments related to employee stock plans.LiquidityOur primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated byour operations.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKInvestment and Interest Rate RiskWe are exposed to interest rate risk related to our floating and fixed-rate investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Theinvestment portfolio is managed consistent with our overall liquidity strategy in support of both working capital needs andstrategic growth of our businesses.As of January 26, 2020, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments. Accordingto our analysis, parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 0.5% would result in changes in fair values for theseinvestments of $1 million.In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2021 and $1.00 billion of the Notes Due 2026. We carry theNotes at face value less unamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As the Notes bear interest at a fixedrate, we have no financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to theConsolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Foreign Exchange Rate RiskWe consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal. Gains or losses from foreign currencyremeasurement are included in other income or expense and to date have not been significant. The impact of foreigncurrency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2020 and 2019.Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and,therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to othercurrencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely,decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising theirprices in order to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we have international operations and incur expendituresin currencies other than U.S. dollars. Our operating expenses benefit from a stronger dollar and are adversely affected bya weaker dollar. We use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on ouroperating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedgerelationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensiveincome or loss, and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earningsor ineffectiveness should occur.We also use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assetsand liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated forhedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expenseand offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which isalso recorded in other income or expense.Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form10-K for additional information. 33ITEM 8.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESControls and ProceduresDisclosure Controls and ProceduresBased on their evaluation as of January 26, 2020, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief FinancialOfficer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance.Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, assuch term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of ourinternal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2020 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - IntegratedFramework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on ourevaluation under the criteria set forth in Internal Control — Integrated Framework, our management concluded that ourinternal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 26, 2020.The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2020 has been audited byPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is includedherein.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materiallyaffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of ControlsOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosurecontrols and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how wellconceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system aremet. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits ofcontrols must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluationof controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have beendetected.34ITEM 9B.  OTHER INFORMATIONNone.PART III Certain information required by Part III is omitted from this report because we will file with the SEC a definitive proxystatement pursuant to Regulation 14A, or the 2020 Proxy Statement, no later than 120 days after the end of fiscal year2020, and certain information included therein is incorporated herein by reference.ITEM 10.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as ofJanuary 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committeeof Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financialposition of the Company as of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flowsfor each of the three years in the period ended January 26, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally acceptedin the United States of America.

Ourresponsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internalcontrol over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public CompanyAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company inaccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and ExchangeCommission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and performthe audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of materialmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintainedin all material respects.  Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of materialmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures thatrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts anddisclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles usedand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financialstatements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal controlover financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design andoperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such otherprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis forour opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding thereliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance withgenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies andprocedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recordedas necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management37and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financialstatements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequatebecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financialstatements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accountsor disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging,subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on theconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Valuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete InventoriesAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for inventory provisionsto write down inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory.Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on the Company’sinventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and marketconditions. Management applies significant judgment in the valuation of inventories, which involves estimating futuredemand and market conditions. As of January 26, 2020, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $979 million.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories,specifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, is a critical audit matter are that there was significant judgmentby management when developing their provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including management’s assumptionsrelated to future demand and market conditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort inperforming procedures over the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, which included evaluating management’sassumptions related to future demand and market conditions.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overallopinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relatingto management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories, including controls over management’s assumptions relatedto future demand and market conditions. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s processfor developing the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach;testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating thereasonableness of management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management’sassumptions related to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used bymanagement were reasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii) theconsistency with external market and industry data, (iii) changes in technology, and (iv) comparing prior period estimatesto actual results of the same period./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaFebruary 20, 2020We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2004. 38NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS45Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesOur CompanyHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delawarein April 1998. All references to “NVIDIA,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean NVIDIA Corporation and its subsidiaries.Fiscal YearWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 were 52-week years. Fiscal year 2021 will be a 53-week year.ReclassificationsCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.Principles of ConsolidationOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Allintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates andassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilitiesat the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including thoserelated to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes,goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, andother contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe arereasonable.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, andsoftware licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with acustomer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4)allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, oras, we satisfy a performance obligation.Product Sales RevenueRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount thatreflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Revenue is recognized net of allowancesfor returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance forestimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if productreturns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales returnallowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products invarious target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that areearmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promotingNVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFsbased on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.License and Development ArrangementsOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectualproperty components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development servicesas a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progressto completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete eachproject. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.Software LicensingOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer.Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration overwhich the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with post-contract customersupport, or PCS. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to the software license and PCS on a relative standaloneselling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performanceobligation. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer.PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.Advertising ExpensesWe expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred. Advertising expenses for fiscal years 2020, 2019,and 2018 were $15 million, $21 million, and $25 million, respectively. Product WarrantiesWe generally offer a limited warranty to end-users that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair orreplace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimatedcost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we mayoffer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnificationissues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.Stock-based CompensationWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair valueof awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financialperformance targets, or PSUs. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performancestock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs. The compensation expense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite employee service period whilecompensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model. We estimate the fair value ofshares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencementof an offering period in March and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using anaccelerated amortization model. Additionally, we estimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revisethe estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.Litigation, Investigation and Settlement CostsFrom time to time, we are involved in legal actions and/or investigations by regulatory bodies. There are many uncertaintiesassociated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third-party claims againstus will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments. If information becomes available thatcauses us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, investigations or settlements is probable, and we canreasonably estimate the loss associated with such events, we will record the loss in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However,the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates, which could requireus to record additional costs.Foreign Currency RemeasurementWe use the United States dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assetsand liabilities are remeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilitiessuch as property and equipment, and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses areremeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the previouslynoted balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currencyNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)46remeasurement are included in other income or expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have notbeen significant.Income TaxesWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundablein the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, asappropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we recorda valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidenceand judgment, are not expected to be realized.Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing withuncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based,in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the UnitedStates, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognizeliabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extentto which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recordedtax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional incometax expense in our financial statements accordingly.As of January 26, 2020, we had a valuation allowance of $621 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assetsthat management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income andpotential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realizationof the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income taxbenefit during the period.We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained uponaudit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related tounrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.Net Income Per ShareBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during theperiod. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutiveshares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the effect of equityawards outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is anti-dilutive. Cash and Cash EquivalentsWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three monthsor less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable SecuritiesMarketable securities consist of highly liquid debt investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased.We generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These debt securities arereported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive incomeor loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fair value of interest-bearing debt securities includes accruedinterest. Any unrealized losses which are considered to be other-than-temporary impairments are recorded in the otherincome or expense, net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income. Realized gains and losses on the sale ofmarketable securities are determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the other income or expense,net, section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.All of our available-for-sale debt investments are subject to a periodic impairment review. We record a charge to earningswhen a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be other-than-temporary or have other indicatorsof impairments. If the fair value of an available-for-sale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where (1) we intend to sell the instrument, (2) it is more likelythan not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis, or (3) a credit loss existswhere we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument. In these situations, we recognize anNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)47other-than-temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments’ amortized costbasis and its fair value. For available-for-sale debt instruments that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired dueto the existence of a credit loss, if we do not intend to sell and it is not likely that we will be required to sell the instrumentbefore recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis (amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss), we separatethe amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors. The credit losscomponent is recognized in earnings while loss related to all other factors is recorded in accumulated other comprehensiveincome or loss.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fairvalues due to their relatively short maturities as of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019. Marketable securities arecomprised of available-for-sale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains or losses includedin accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. Fair value of themarketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices. Derivative instruments are recognized as either assetsor liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on theintended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges,the gains or losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on thehedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effectiveportion of the gains or losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or lossand is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings.  For derivative instrumentsnot designated for hedge accounting, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.Concentration of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents,marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed incomesecurities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration.Accounts receivable from significant customers, those representing 10% or more of total accounts receivable, wasapproximately 21% of our accounts receivable balance from one customer as of January 26, 2020 and 19% of our accountsreceivable balance from one customer as of January 27, 2019. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identifiedfor specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludesamounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit.Accounts ReceivableWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customersto make required payments. We determine this allowance by identifying amounts for specific customer issues as well asamounts based on overall estimated exposure. Factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables, thefinancial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit.InventoriesInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors, including waferfabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated withsuch purchases, final test yield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and othercomponent parts. We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or netrealizable value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory. Most of our inventory provisions relate to the write-off of excess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared toassumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it createsa new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-linemethod based on the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years. Once an asset is identified forretirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or lossis recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years. Depreciation expense includes the amortizationNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)48of assets recorded under capital leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded under capital leases are amortizedover the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.LeasesWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12months are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilitieson our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease termand lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments discountedusing our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and prepaid leasepayments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonablycertain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.We combine the lease and non-lease components in determining the operating lease assets and liabilities.Refer to Note 3 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.GoodwillGoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, or earlier if indicators ofpotential impairment exist.  For the purposes of completing our impairment test, we perform either a qualitative or aquantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis. Qualitative factors include industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant eventsand factors affecting the reporting units. Our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reportingunit’s fair value. The income and market valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include, but are not limitedto, prospective financial information, growth rates, residual values, discount rates and comparable multiples from publiclytraded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economicfactors and the future profitability of our business. Refer to Note 6 of these Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statementsfor additional information. Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived AssetsIntangible assets primarily represent rights acquired under technology licenses, patents, acquired intellectual property,trademarks and customer relationships. We currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periodsranging from three to ten years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangibleasset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be reliably determined, using a straight-line amortizationmethod. Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed forimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset groupmay not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amountof an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, or assetgroup. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge isrecognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value ofthe asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to begenerated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in theConsolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less coststo sell, and would no longer be depreciated.Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsRecently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standards update regarding the accounting forleases under which lease assets and liabilities are recognized on the balance sheet. We adopted this guidance on JanuaryNVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)4928, 2019 using the optional transition method by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to the consolidated balancesheet. Refer to Note 3 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In June 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology undercurrent GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range ofreasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. We will be required to use a forward-lookingexpected credit loss model for accounts receivable and other financial instruments, including available-for-sale debtsecurities. We plan to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective transition method beginning in the first quarterof fiscal year 2021. We do not currently believe it will have a material impact upon adoption.NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)50Note 2 - Acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.On March 10, 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Mellanox TechnologiesLtd., or Mellanox, pursuant to which we will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Mellanox for $125per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $6.9 billion as of the date of the Merger Agreement.The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. The consummation of the mergeris conditioned on the receipt of the approval of Mellanox shareholders, as well as the satisfaction of other customary closingconditions, including domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and performance in all material respects by each party ofits obligations under the Merger Agreement. In June 2019, Mellanox shareholders approved the consummation of themerger and we received regulatory approvals for the deal from Mexico in July 2019 and from the European Commissionin December 2019. In addition, the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, asamended, in connection with the proposed acquisition expired in May 2019. Discussions with China's regulatory agency,the State Administration for Market Regulation, are progressing and we believe the acquisition will likely close in the earlypart of calendar 2020. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtainthe required regulatory approvals, we could be obligated to pay Mellanox a termination fee of $350 million.Note 3 - New Lease Accounting StandardMethod and Impact of AdoptionOn January 28, 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard using the optional transition method by recognizinga cumulative-effect adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet and not adjusting comparative information for priorperiods. In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which allowedus not to reassess (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) lease classification for any expiredor existing leases, and (3) initial direct costs for any existing leases. The cumulative-effect adjustment upon adoption of the new lease accounting standard resulted in the recognition of $470million of operating lease assets and $500 million of operating lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Thedifference of $30 million represents deferred rent for leases that existed as of the date of adoption, which was an offset tothe opening balance of operating lease assets.Lease ObligationsOur lease obligations consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and international office facilities,and data center space, with lease periods expiring between fiscal years 2021 and 2035.Future minimum lease payments under our operating leases as of January 26, 2020, are as follows: Operating LeaseObligations(In millions)Fiscal Year:2021 $121202211720231022024792025622026 and thereafter292Total773Less imputed interest121Present value of net future minimum lease payments652Less short-term operating lease liabilities91Long-term operating lease liabilities$561Future minimum lease payments under our non-cancelable operating leases as of January 27, 2019, based on the previouslease accounting standard, are as follows:Lease Obligations(In millions)Fiscal Year:2020$1002021972022902023772024542025 and thereafter265Total$683Operating lease expense for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $114 million, $80 million, $54 million, respectively.

The risk-free interest rate assumption used to value ESPP shares is based upon observed interest rates on Treasurybills appropriate for the expected term. Our expected stock price volatility assumption for ESPP is estimated using historicalvolatility. For awards granted, we use the dividend yield at grant date. Our RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards arenot eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting; therefore, the fair values of RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs arediscounted for the dividend yield.Additionally, for RSU, PSU, and market-based PSU awards, we estimate forfeitures annually and revise the estimates offorfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based onhistorical experience.Equity Incentive ProgramWe grant or have granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, market-based PSUs, and stock purchase rights under the followingequity incentive plans.Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive PlanIn 2007, our shareholders approved the NVIDIA Corporation 2007 Equity Incentive Plan, as most recently amended andrestated, the 2007 Plan.The 2007 Plan authorizes the issuance of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, restrictedstock units, stock appreciation rights, performance stock awards, performance cash awards, and other stock-based awardsto employees, directors and consultants. Only our employees may receive incentive stock options. Up to 230 million sharesof our common stock may be issued pursuant to stock awards granted under the 2007 Plan. Currently, we grant RSUs,PSUs and market-based PSUs under the 2007 Plan, under which, as of January 26, 2020, there were 29 million sharesavailable for future issuance.Stock options previously granted to employees, subject to certain exceptions, vested over a four-year period, subject tocontinued service, with 25% vesting on the anniversary of the hire date in the case of new hires or the anniversary of thedate of grant in the case of grants to existing employees and 6.25% vesting quarterly thereafter. These stock options generallyexpire ten years from the date of grant.Subject to certain exceptions, RSUs and PSUs granted to employees vest over a four-year period, subject to continuedservice, with 25% vesting on a pre-determined date that is close to the anniversary of the date of grant and (i) for grantsmade prior to May 18, 2016, 12.5% vesting semi-annually thereafter, and (ii) for grants made on or after May 18, 2016, 6.25%vesting quarterly thereafter. Market-based PSUs vest 100% on approximately the three-year anniversary of the date ofgrant. However, the number of shares subject to both PSUs and market-based PSUs that are eligible to vest is generallydetermined by the Compensation Committee based on achievement of pre-determined criteria.Unless terminated sooner, the 2007 Plan is scheduled to terminate on March 21, 2022. Our Board may suspend or terminatethe 2007 Plan at any time. No awards may be granted under the 2007 Plan while the 2007 Plan is suspended or after it isterminated. The Board may also amend the 2007 Plan at any time. However, if legal, regulatory or listing requirementsrequire shareholder approval, the amendment will not go into effect until the shareholders have approved the amendment.NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)53Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Purchase PlanIn 2012, our shareholders approved the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as most recently amended and restated, the2012 Plan, as the successor to the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.Up to 89 million shares of our common stock may be issued pursuant to purchases under the 2012 Plan. As of January 26,2020, we had issued 30 million shares and reserved 59 million shares for future issuance under the 2012 Plan.The 2012 Plan is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.Under the current offerings adopted pursuant to the 2012 Plan, each offering period is approximately 24 months, which isgenerally divided into four purchase periods of six months.Employees or those employed by an affiliate of ours are eligible to participate as designated by the Board. Employees whoparticipate may have up to 10% of their earnings withheld to the purchase of shares of common stock. The Board mayincrease this percentage at its discretion, up to 15%. The price of common stock purchased under our 2012 Plan will beequal to 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the commencement date of each offering periodand the fair market value on each purchase date within the offering.The following is a summary of our equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans: RSUs, PSUs and Market-based PSUs OutstandingNumber of SharesWeighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value(In millions, except years and per share data)Balances, January 27, 2019........................................................................16$129.92Granted (1)(2).............................................................................................7$184.47Vested restricted stock...........................................................................(8)$92.70Canceled and forfeited............................................................................(1)$185.46Balances, January 26, 2020........................................................................14$176.72Vested and expected to vest after January 26, 202011$176.46(1)Includes the number of PSUs that will be issued and eligible to vest based on the corporate financial performance level achieved for fiscal year 2020.(2)Includes the number of market-based PSUs granted that will be issued and eligible to vest if the maximum goal for total shareholder return, or TSR,over the 3-year measurement period is achieved.

Nvidia Corporation, et al. (Case No. 18-cv-7669), namingas defendants NVIDIA and certain of NVIDIA’s officers. On December 28, 2018, a substantially similar purported securitiesclass action was commenced in the Northern District of California, captioned Oto v. Nvidia Corporation, et al. (Case No. 18-cv-07783), naming the same defendants, and seeking substantially similar relief. On February 19, 2019, a number ofshareholders filed motions to consolidate the two cases and to be appointed lead plaintiff and for their respective counselto be appointed lead counsel. On March 12, 2019, the two cases were consolidated under case number 4:18-cv-07669-HSGand titled In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation. On May 2, 2019, the Court appointed lead plaintiffs and lead counsel.On June 21, 2019, the lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint. The consolidated complaint asserts thatthe defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SECRule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact ofcryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. The plaintiffs also allege that theNVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The plaintiffs seek classcertification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, includingattorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On August 2, 2019, NVIDIA movedto dismiss the consolidated class action complaint on the basis that plaintiffs failed to state any claims for violations of thesecurities laws by NVIDIA or the named defendants. On January 18, 2019, a shareholder, purporting to act on behalf of NVIDIA, filed a derivative lawsuit in the Northern Districtof California, captioned Han v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 19-cv-00341), seeking to assert claims on behalf of NVIDIA againstthe members of NVIDIA’s board of directors and certain officers. The lawsuit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty,unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act basedon the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact ofcryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiff is seeking unspecified damages and other relief, including reformsand improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures. On February 12, 2019, a substantially similarderivative lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California captioned Yang v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 19-cv-00766),naming the same named defendants, and seeking the same relief. On February 19, 2019, a third substantially similarderivative lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California captioned The Booth Family Trust v. Huang, et. al. (Case No.3:19-cv-00876), naming the same named defendants, and seeking substantially the same relief. On March 12, 2019, thethree derivative actions were consolidated under case number 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, and titled In re NVIDIA CorporationConsolidated Derivative Litigation. The parties stipulated to stay the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated DerivativeLitigation pending resolution of any motion to dismiss that NVIDIA may file in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation SecuritiesLitigation. On September 24, 2019, two shareholders, purporting to act on behalf of NVIDIA, filed two identical lawsuits in the Districtof Delaware. One is captioned Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and the other is captioned Nelson v.Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798- UNA). The lawsuits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment,insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of theExchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel inventory andthe impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, includingdisgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures. On December 11,2019, the court approved the parties’ stipulation to stay the Lipchitz and Huang actions pending resolution of the motion todismiss filed by NVIDIA in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation.It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations received from shareholders, with respect to these same orother matters, naming NVIDIA and/or its officers and directors as defendants.Accounting for Loss Contingencies We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be noassurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverseeffect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position. As of January 26, 2020, we have not recorded any accrual forcontingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible,are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannotbe reasonably estimated at this time.NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE

(1)...........................................................................................................$519$541(1)  Net deferred tax asset includes long-term deferred tax assets of $548 million and $560 million and long-term deferred tax liabilities of $29 millionand $19 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Long-term deferred tax assets are included in Other assets and long-term deferred taxliabilities are included in Other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recognized an income tax expense of $174 million and $149 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2018, respectively, andincome tax benefit of $245 million for fiscal year 2019. Our annual effective tax rate was 5.9%, (6.3)%, and 4.7% for fiscalyears 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscalyears 2019 and 2018 was primarily due to a decrease of tax benefits from stock-based compensation and an absence oftax benefits related to the enactment of the TCJA.The decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2019 as compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to a decreasein the U.S. statutory tax rate from 33.9% to 21%, the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA, higherU.S federal research tax credits and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in fiscal year 2019.Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due primarily toincome earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong, where the tax rate was lower than theU.S. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits,  excess tax benefits related tostock-based compensation, and the finalization of the enactment-date income tax effects of the TCJA in 2019.Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was lower than the blended U.S. federal statutory rate of 33.9% due primarily toincome earned in jurisdictions, including the British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and United Kingdom, wherethe tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rates, favorable recognition of U.S. federal research tax credits,the provisional impact of the tax law changes, and excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.As of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019, we had a valuation allowance of $621 million and $562 million, respectively,related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due, in part,to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period.NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)64As of January 26, 2020, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $70 million, $153 million and$295 million, respectively. The federal and state carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal year 2023 and 2021, respectively.The foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $295 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of January 26, 2020,we had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $314 million that will begin to expire in fiscal year 2039. We have stateresearch tax credit carryforwards of $814 million, of which $774 million is attributable to the State of California and maybe carried over indefinitely, and $40 million is attributable to various other states and will begin to expire in fiscal year2021. Our tax attributes, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, remain subject to audit and may be adjusted forchanges or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations thereof, or other facts and circumstances. Utilizationof federal, state, and foreign net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may also be subject to limitations due toownership changes and other limitations provided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state and foreign taxprovisions. If any such limitations apply, the federal, states, or foreign net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, asapplicable, may expire or be denied before utilization.As of January 26, 2020, we had $583 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $464 million would affect oureffective tax rate if recognized. However, $104 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income taxpositions taken, that, if recognized, would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a fullvaluation allowance. The $464 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of January 26, 2020 consisted of $180 million recordedin non-current income taxes payable and $284 million reflected as a reduction to the related deferred tax assets.A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:January 26,  2020January 27,  2019January 28,  2018(In millions)Balance at beginning of period...............................................................................$477$447$224Increases in tax positions for prior years............................................................7527Decreases in tax positions for prior years..........................................................—(141)(1)Increases in tax positions for current year.........................................................104129222Lapse in statute of limitations................................................................................(5)(10)(5)Balance at end of period...........................................................................................$583$477$447We classify an unrecognized tax benefit as a current liability, or amount refundable, to the extent that we anticipate paymentor receipt of cash for income taxes within one year. The amount is classified as a long-term liability, or reduction of long-term deferred tax assets or amount refundable if we anticipate payment or receipt of cash for income taxes during a periodbeyond a year.Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.As of January 26, 2020, January 27, 2019, and January 28, 2018, we had accrued $31 million, $21 million, and $15 million,respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which is not included as acomponent of our unrecognized tax benefits. As of January 26, 2020, unrecognized tax benefits of $180 million and therelated interest and penalties of $31 million are included in non-current income taxes payable.While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greateror less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax-related matters to be recordedin the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. Asof January 26, 2020, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantlyincrease or decrease within the next twelve months.We are subject to taxation by taxing authorities both in the United States and other countries. As of January 26, 2020, thesignificant tax jurisdictions that may be subject to examination include the United States, Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, UnitedKingdom, Germany, and India for fiscal years 2003 through 2019. As of January 26, 2020, the significant tax jurisdictionsfor which we are currently under examination include India, China, and United Kingdom for fiscal years 2003 through 2019.NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)65Note 15 - Shareholders’ EquityCapital Return ProgramBeginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.Through January 26, 2020, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares under our share repurchase programfor a total cost of $7.08 billion. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As ofJanuary 26, 2020, we are authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase shares of our common stock up to $7.24billion through December 2022. During fiscal year 2020, we paid $390 million in cash dividends to our shareholders.Preferred StockAs of January 26, 2020 and January 27, 2019, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding.Common StockWe are authorized to issue up to 2.00 billion shares of our common stock at $0.001 per share par value.NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)66Note 16 - Employee Retirement PlansWe have a 401(k) retirement plan covering substantially all of our U.S. employees. Under the plan, participating employeesmay defer up to 80% of their pre-tax earnings, subject to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limits and wematch a portion of the employee contributions. Our contribution expense for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $44million, $39 million, and $23 million, respectively. We also have defined contribution retirement plans outside of the UnitedStates to which we contributed $32 million, $31 million, and $25 million for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.Note 17 - Segment Information Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financialinformation presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financialperformance. Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments. We report our business in two primary reportable segments - the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business - basedon a single underlying graphics architecture. Our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla andDGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brandincorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as forgame consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices.Under the single unifying architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors, we leverage our visual computing expertise bycharging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business, while charging the TegraProcessor business for the incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business. In instances where the operatingexpenses of certain functions benefit both reportable segments, our CODM assigns 100% of those expenses to the reportablesegment that benefits the most. The “All Other” category presented below represents the revenue and expenses that our CODM does not assign to eitherthe GPU business or the Tegra Processor business for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financialperformance. The revenue included in all other is Intel licensing revenue and the expenses include stock-basedcompensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, legal settlement costs, acquisition-related and othercosts, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature. Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Reportable segments donot record inter-segment revenue, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported. The accounting policies for segmentreporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportablesegments and the “All Other” category.GPUTegraProcessorAll OtherConsolidated(In millions)Year Ended January 26, 2020:Revenue.........................................................................$9,465$1,453$—$10,918Depreciation and amortization expense..............$322$44$15$381Operating income (loss)............................................$3,806$196$(1,156)$2,846Year Ended January 27, 2019:Revenue.........................................................................$10,175$1,541$—$11,716Depreciation and amortization expense..............$197$47$18$262Operating income (loss)............................................$4,443$241$(880)$3,804Year Ended January 28, 2018:Revenue.........................................................................$8,137$1,534$43$9,714Depreciation and amortization expense..............$123$37$39$199Operating income (loss)............................................$3,507$303$(600)$3,210Year EndedJanuary 26,  2020January 27,  2019January 28,  2018(In millions)Reconciling items included in "All Other" category:Unallocated revenue......................................................................................$—$—$43Stock-based compensation expense........................................................(844)(557)(391)Unallocated cost of revenue and operating expenses........................(267)(277)(237)Acquisition-related and other costs..........................................................(30)(2)(15)Legal settlement costs.................................................................................(15)(44)—Total....................................................................................................................$(1,156)$(880)$(600)Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initiallybilled even if our customers’ revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location.
