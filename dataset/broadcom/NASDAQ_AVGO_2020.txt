Distributors and OEMs, ortheir contract manufacturers, typically account for the substantial majority of our semiconductor sales. Historically, a relatively small number ofcustomers have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue. Sales to distributors accounted for 42% and 46% of our net revenue for fiscalyears 2020 and 2019, respectively. We believe our aggregate sales to our top five end customers, through all channels, accounted for more than30% of our net revenue for each of our fiscal years 2020 and 2019. We believe aggregate sales to Apple Inc., through all channels, accounted forapproximately 15% and 20% of our net revenue for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect to continue to experience significantcustomer concentration in future periods. The loss of, or significant decrease in demand from, any of our top five end customers could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Many of our semiconductor customers design products in North America or Europe that are then manufactured in Asia. To serve customersaround the world, we have strategically developed relationships with large global electronic component distributors, complemented by a number ofregional distributors with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges. We also sell our products to a wide variety of OEMs ortheir contract manufacturers. We have established strong relationships with leading OEM customers across multiple target markets. Our direct salesforce focuses on supporting our large OEM customers, and has specialized product and service knowledge that enables us to sell specific offeringsat key levels throughout a customer’s organization. Certain customers require us to contract with them directly and with specified intermediaries,such as contract manufacturers. Many of our major customer relationships have been in place for many years and are often the result of years ofcollaborative product development. This has enabled us to build our extensive IP portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our customers’requirements, including substantial system-level knowledge. This collaboration has provided us with key insights into our customers' businesses andhas enabled us to be more efficient and productive and to better serve our target markets and customers. Many of our customers and their contractmanufacturers often require time critical delivery of our products to multiple locations around the world. With sales offices located in variouscountries, our primary warehouse in Malaysia, and dedicated regional customer support call centers, where we address customer issues and handlelogistics and other order fulfillment requirements, we believe we are well-positioned to support our customers throughout the design, technologytransfer and manufacturing stages across all geographies.Our software customers are in most major industries worldwide, including banks, insurance companies, other financial services providers,government agencies, global information technology (“IT”) service providers, telecommunication providers, transportation companies, manufacturers,technology companies, retailers, educational organizations and health care institutions.

We believe our enterprise-wide license model will continue to offer our customers reduced complexity, moreflexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth.9Table of ContentsManufacturing OperationsWe focus on maintaining an efficient global supply chain and a variable, low-cost operating model. Accordingly, we outsource a majority of ourmanufacturing operations, utilizing third-party foundry and assembly and test capabilities, as well as some of our corporate infrastructure functions.The majority of our front-end wafer manufacturing operations is outsourced to external foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor ManufacturingCompany Limited (“TSMC”). We use third-party contract manufacturers for a significant majority of our assembly and test operations, includingAdvanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc., Foxconn Technology Group, Amkor Technology, Inc. and Siliconware Precision Industries Co., Ltd. Weuse our internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative and proprietary processes, to protect our IP and to accelerate time to marketfor our products, while outsourcing commodity processes such as standard CMOS. Examples of internally fabricated semiconductors include ourFBAR filters for wireless communications and our vertical-cavity surface emitting laser and side emitting lasers-based on GaAs and InP lasers forfiber optic communications. The majority of our internal III-V semiconductor wafer fabrication is done in the U.S. and Singapore. Many of ourproducts are designed to be manufactured in a specific process, typically at one particular foundry, either our own or with a particular contractmanufacturer, and in some instances, we may only qualify one contract manufacturer to manufacture certain of our products.We also have a long history of operating in Asia, where approximately 35% of our employees are located and where we manufacture andsource the majority of our products and materials. We store the majority of our product inventory in our warehouse in Malaysia and our presence inAsia places us in close proximity to many of our customers’ manufacturing facilities and at the center of worldwide electronics manufacturing.Manufacturing Materials and SuppliersOur manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials. Wepurchase materials from hundreds of suppliers on a global basis. These supply relationships are generally conducted on a purchase order basis.While we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining the materials used in the conduct of our business and we believe that no singlesupplier is material, some of the parts are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary forre-design or qualification. Our long-term relationships with our suppliers allow us to proactively manage our technology development and productdiscontinuance plans, and to monitor our suppliers' financial health. Some suppliers may, nonetheless, extend their lead times, limit supplies,increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products. If these are unique or highly specialized components, we may not be able tofind a substitute quickly, or at all. To address the potential disruption in our supply chain, we may use a number of techniques, including, in somecases, qualifying more than one source of supply, redesigning products for alternative components and incremental, or in some cases, "lifetime"purchases of affected parts for supply buffer.CompetitionThe markets in which we participate are highly competitive. Our competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range ofproducts to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets. The competitive landscape is changing as a result of a trend toward consolidationwithin many industries, as some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors, while others have begun collaboratingwith each other. We expect this consolidation trend to continue. We expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increaseas existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings and as new companies enter the market. Additionally, our ability to competeeffectively depends on a number of factors, including: quality, technical performance, price, product features, product system compatibility, system-level design capability, engineering expertise, responsiveness to customers, new product innovation, product availability, delivery timing andreliability, and customer sales and technical support.In the semiconductor market, we compete with integrated device manufacturers, fabless semiconductor companies, as well as the internalresources of large, integrated OEMs. Our primary competitors are Analog Devices, Inc., Cisco Systems, Inc., Cree, Inc., Finisar Corp.,GlobalFoundries, Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Heidenhain Corporation, HiSilicon Technologies Co. Ltd., Intel Corp., Lumentum Operations LLC,MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., Marvell Technology Group, Ltd., Mediatek Inc., Mellanox Technologies, Inc., Microsemi Corp.,Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., NXP Semiconductors N.V., Qorvo, Inc., Qualcomm Inc., QuantennaCommunications, Inc. (acquired by ON Semiconductor Corporation), ST Microelectronics N.V., Renesas Electronics Corporation, SkyworksSolutions, Inc., Sumitomo Corporation, TDK-EPC Corporation, Toshiba Corporation, and Texas Instruments, Inc. We compete based on the strengthand expertise of our high speed proprietary design expertise, FBAR technology, amplifier design, module integration, proprietary materialsprocesses, multiple storage protocols and mixed-signal design, our broad product portfolio, support of key industry standards, reputation for qualityproducts, and our customer relationships.In the infrastructure software market, we compete with large vendors of hardware and operating system software and cloud service providers,who continue to both expand their product and service offerings, and consolidate offerings into broad product lines. Our primary competitors areAppDynamics, Inc. (acquired by Cisco), Atlassian Corporation, Plc, BMC Software10Table of ContentsInc., BeyondTrust, Cisco Systems, Inc., Compuware Corporation, CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc., CyberArk Software, Ltd., International BusinessMachines Corporation, Micro Focus International Plc, Microsoft Corporation, MuleSoft, Inc. (acquired by Salesforce.com, Inc.), New Relic, Inc.,Oracle Corporation, Proofpoint, Inc., SailPoint, Inc., ServiceNow, Inc., SolarWinds, Inc., Splunk, Inc., VMware, Inc. and Zscaler, Inc. We competebased on our breadth of portfolio of enterprise management tools, breadth and synergy of offerings, our platform and hardware independence, ourglobal reach, and our deep customer relationships and industry experience.Intellectual PropertyOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our IP. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of IP rights, including patents,copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and similar IP, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers,employees and consultants, and through security measures to protect our trade secrets. We believe our current product expertise, key engineeringtalent and IP portfolio provide us with a strong platform from which to develop application specific products in key target markets.As of November 1, 2020, we had 22,774 U.S. and other patents and 1,018 U.S. and other pending patent applications. The expiration dates ofour patents range from 2020 to 2039, with a small number of patents expiring in the near future, none of which are expected to be material to our IPportfolio. We are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents.We focus our patent application program to a greater extent on those inventions and improvements that we believe are likely to be incorporatedinto our products, as contrasted with more basic research. However, we do not know how many of our pending patent applications will result in theissuance of patents or the extent to which the examination process could require us to narrow our claims.We and our predecessors have also entered into a variety of IP licensing and cross-licensing arrangements that have both benefited ourbusiness and enabled some of our competitors. A portion of our revenue comes from IP licensing royalty payments and from litigation settlementsrelating to such IP. We also license third-party technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our design activities, products andmanufacturing processes. Historically, licenses of the third-party technologies used by us have generally been available to us on acceptable terms.The industries in which we compete are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secretsand by the vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of IP rights, including by patent holding companies that do not make or sell products. Manyof our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third-party IP infringement claims arising from our products. Claims of this sortcould harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us. With respect to any IP rights claimsagainst us or our customers or distributors, we may be required to defend ourselves or our customers or distributors in litigation, cease manufacturethe infringing products, pay damages, expend resources to develop non-infringing technology, seek a license which may not be available oncommercially reasonable terms or at all, or relinquish patents or other IP rights.With respect to our infrastructure software, the source code for our products is protected both as a trade secret and as copyrighted work.Except with respect to software components that are subject to open source licenses, our customers do not generally have access to the sourcecode for our products. Rather, on-premise customers typically access only the executable code for our products, and SaaS customers access onlythe functionality of our SaaS offerings. Under certain contingent circumstances, some of our customers are beneficiaries of a source code escrowarrangement that enables them to obtain a limited right to access our source code.EmployeesOur future success depends on our ability to retain, attract and motivate qualified personnel. As the source of our technological and productinnovations, our engineering and technical personnel are a significant asset. Competition for these employees is significant in many areas of theworld in which we operate, particularly in Silicon Valley and Southeast Asia where qualified engineers are in high demand. We track and reportinternally on key talent metrics including the portion of our workforce in research and development and the voluntary attrition rate. During fiscal year2020, our voluntary attrition rate was 7%, below the technology industry benchmark (AON, 2020 Salary Increase and Turnover Study — SecondEdition, September 2020).As of November 1, 2020, we had approximately 21,000 employees worldwide, with approximately 63% of them in research and development.By geography, approximately 53% of our employees are located in North America, 35% in Asia, and 12% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa anda significant majority of our research and development personnel are located in Czech Republic, India, Israel, Singapore and the U.S.11Table of ContentsGovernmental RegulationOur semiconductor manufacturing operations and research and development involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated underinternational, federal, state and local laws governing health, safety and the environment. These regulations include limitations on discharge ofpollutants to air, water, and soil; remediation requirements; product chemical content limitations; manufacturing chemical use and handlingrestrictions; pollution control requirements; waste minimization considerations; and treatment, transport, storage and disposal of solid and hazardouswastes. We are also subject to regulation by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and similar health and safety laws in otherjurisdictions.We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and workerhealth and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that theapplication of environmental, health and safety laws to our business will not require us to incur significant expenditures.We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product contentrequirements, including legislation enacted in the U.S., European Union and China, among a growing number of jurisdictions, which have placedgreater restrictions on the use of lead, among other chemicals, in electronic products, which affects materials composition and semiconductorpackaging. In addition, our business is subject to various import/export regulations, such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, andapplicable executive orders, and rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by otheragencies, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). These laws, regulations and orders are complex, may change frequently and withlimited notice, have generally become more stringent over time, and have intensified under the current U.S. administration, especially in light ofongoing trade tensions with China. We may incur significant expenditures in future periods as a result.BacklogOur semiconductor sales are generally made pursuant to short-term purchase orders. These purchase orders are made without deposits andmay be rescheduled, cancelled or modified on relatively short notice, without substantial penalty. In addition, our software contracting model for themajority of our customers, which are for enterprise-wide licenses, provide for termination thereof by our customers at any time for any reason. As aresult, we recognize revenue from these contracts ratably over time. Therefore, although we may have a large backlog from time to time, we believethat purchase orders or backlog are not necessarily a reliable indicator of future sales.SeasonalityHistorically, our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half, primarily due to seasonality in ourwireless communications products. These products have historically experienced seasonality due to launches of new mobile handsets manufacturedby our OEM customers. However, from time to time, typical seasonality and industry cyclicality are overshadowed by other factors such as widermacroeconomic effects, the timing of significant product transitions and launches by large OEMs, particularly with our wireless communicationsproducts. We have a diversified business portfolio and we believe that our overall revenue is less susceptible to seasonal variations as a result of thisdiversification.Other InformationOur website is www.broadcom.com.

our business, see below.Risks Related to Our BusinessThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has, and will likely continue to, negatively impact the global economy and disrupt normal businessactivity, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.The global spread of COVID-19 and the efforts to control it have slowed global economic activity and disrupted, and reduced the efficiency of,normal business activities in much of the world. The pandemic has resulted in authorities around the world implementing numerous unprecedentedmeasures such as travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and factory and office shutdowns. These measures have impacted, andwill likely continue to impact our workforce and operations, and those of our customers, contract manufacturers (“CMs”), suppliers and logisticsproviders, particularly in the event of a significant global resurgence of the illness.14Table of ContentsWe have been, and expect to continue, experiencing some disruption to parts of our global semiconductor supply chain, with suppliers increasinglead times or placing products on allocation, including procuring necessary components and inputs, such as wafers and substrates, in a timelyfashion. In addition, our primary warehouse and a number of our key suppliers, particularly assembly and test service providers, are in Malaysia.While our Malaysia warehouse has remained fully operational, many of the facilities of our key suppliers and other service providers were shut downor operated at reduced capacity for extended periods. This resulted in significant logistical challenges and product delays, which could recur in theevent of any future closures of, or periods of reduced operations at, our warehouse or the facilities of our suppliers and providers. Any similardisruption at our Fort Collins, Colorado manufacturing facility would severely impact our ability to manufacture our FBAR products and adverselyaffect our wireless business. In addition, disruptions to commercial transportation infrastructure have increased delivery times for materials andcomponents to our facilities, transfers of our products to our key suppliers and, in some cases, our ability to timely ship our products to customers. Asa result of these supply chain disruptions, we have increased customer order lead times and placed some products on allocation. We are also largelybuilding semiconductor products to order, instead of based on customer forecasts, in light of the ongoing uncertainty. This may limit our ability to fulfillorders and we may be unable to satisfy all of the demand for our products, which may adversely affect our relationships with our customers.In response to governmental directives and recommended safety measures, we modified our workplace practices globally, which has resulted inmany of our employees working remotely for extended periods of time. While we have implemented a phased-in return of employees to many of ourfacilities, if the spread of COVID-19 worsens significantly, we may need to further limit onsite operations or otherwise modify our business practicesin a manner that may adversely impact our business. Working remotely for extended periods may reduce our employees’ efficiency and productivity,which may cause product development delays, hamper new product innovation and have other unforeseen adverse effects on our business. Inaddition, if a significant number of our employees, or employees and third parties performing key functions, including our CEO and members of ourboard of directors, become ill, our business may be further adversely impacted. While we have implemented personal safety measures at all of ourfacilities where our employees are working onsite, any actions we take may not be sufficient to mitigate the risk of infection and could result in asignificant number of COVID-19-related claims. Changes to state workers’ compensation laws, as have recently occurred in California, may increaseour potential liability for such claims.In the longer-term, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, and could resultin a global economic downturn and a recession. This would likely adversely affect demand for our products and those of our customers, particularlyconsumer products such as smartphones, which may, in turn negatively impact our results of operations. However, there is a significant degree ofuncertainty and lack of visibility as to the extent and duration of any such downturn or recession. While we continue to see robust demand in oursemiconductor segment, and have seen little impact to our software business from the COVID-19 pandemic, the environment remains uncertain andit may not be sustainable over the longer term. The degree to which the pandemic ultimately impacts our business and results of operations willdepend on future developments beyond our control, including the severity of the pandemic, the extent of actions to contain the virus, availability of avaccine or other treatment, how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume, and the severity and duration ofthe global economic downturn that results from the pandemic.The majority of our sales come from a small number of customers and a reduction in demand or loss of one or more of our significantcustomers may adversely affect our business.We are dependent on a small number of end customers, OEMs, their respective CMs, and certain distributors for a majority of our business,revenue and results of operations. For fiscal year 2020, sales to distributors accounted for 42% of our net revenue. We believe aggregate sales,through all channels, to Apple and our top five end customers, accounted for approximately 15% and more than 30% of our net revenue for fiscalyear 2020, respectively. This customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and our sensitivity to anymaterial, adverse developments experienced by our significant customers.The terms and conditions under which we do business with most of our semiconductor customers generally do not include commitments bythose customers to purchase any specific quantities of products from us. Even in those instances where we enter into an arrangement under which acustomer agrees to source an agreed portion of its product needs from us (provided that we are able to meet specified development, supply andquality commitments), the arrangement often includes pricing schedules or methodologies that apply regardless of the volume of productspurchased, and those customers may not purchase the amount of product we expect. As a result, we may not generate the amount of revenue or thelevel of profitability we expect under such arrangements. Moreover, our top customers’ purchasing power has, in some cases, given them the abilityto make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general. We expect this trend to continue, which may adversely affectour gross margin on certain products and, should we fail to perform under these arrangements, we could also be liable for significant monetarydamages.15Table of ContentsThe loss of, or any substantial reduction in sales to, any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of operations and cash flows.Dependence on contract manufacturing and suppliers of critical components within our supply chain may adversely affect our ability tobring products to market, damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations.We operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes CMs, such as third-party wafer foundries and moduleassembly and test capabilities. Our semiconductor products require wafer manufacturers with state-of-the-art fabrication equipment and techniques,and most of our products are designed to be manufactured in a specific process, typically at one particular fab or foundry, either our own or with aparticular CM.We depend on our CMs to allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality at acceptableyields, and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis. We do not generally have long-term capacity commitments with our CMs andsubstantially all of our manufacturing services are on a purchase order basis with no obligation to provide us with any specified minimum quantities ofproduct. Further, from time to time, our CMs will cease to, or will become unable to, manufacture a component for us. As the lead time needed toidentify, qualify and establish reliable production at acceptable yields, with a new CM is typically lengthy, there is often no readily available alternativesource and there may be other constraints on our ability to change CMs. In addition, qualifying such CMs is often expensive, and they may notproduce products as cost-effectively as our current suppliers. In any such circumstances, we may be unable to meet our customer demand and mayfail to meet our contractual obligations. This could result in the payment of significant damages by us to our customers, and our net revenue coulddecline, adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.We utilize TSMC to produce the substantial majority of our semiconductor wafers. TSMC manufactured approximately 87% of the wafersmanufactured by our CMs during fiscal year 2020. Our wafer requirements represent a significant portion of the total production capacity of TSMC.However, TSMC also fabricates wafers for other companies, including certain of our competitors, and could choose to prioritize capacity for othercustomers or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice, or raise their prices to us, all of which could harm our business, results ofoperations and gross margin. For example, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. (“Huawei”), as well as many of its suppliers, have significantly increasedtheir wafer orders from TSMC due to certain U.S. export restrictions on sales to Huawei. This has caused, and may continue to cause, somedislocations in the semiconductor supply chain which may result in reduced or untimely wafer deliveries to us.Any substantial disruption in TSMC’s supply of wafers to us, or in the other contract manufacturing services that we utilize, as a result of a naturaldisaster, political unrest, military conflict, geopolitical turmoil, trade tensions, medical epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change,economic instability, equipment failure or other cause, could materially harm our business, customer relationships and results of operations.We also depend on our CMs to timely develop new, advanced manufacturing processes, including, in the case of wafer fabrication, transitions tosmaller geometry process technologies. If these new processes are not timely developed or we do not have sufficient access to them, we may beunable to maintain or increase our manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors or to deliver products to our customers, whichcould result in loss of revenue opportunities and damage our relationships with our customers.We purchase a significant amount of the materials used in our products from a limited number of suppliers.Our manufacturing processes and those of our CMs rely on many materials, including silicon, GaAs and InP wafers, copper lead frames,precious and rare earth metals, mold compound, ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases. We purchase a significant portion of ourmaterials, components and finished goods used in our products from a few materials providers, some of which are single source suppliers. As certainmaterials are highly specialized, the lead time needed to identify and qualify a new supplier is typically lengthy and there is often no readily availablealternative source. During fiscal year 2020, we purchased approximately two-thirds of the materials for our manufacturing processes from sixmaterials providers. We do not generally have long-term contracts with our materials providers and substantially all of our purchases are on apurchase order basis. Suppliers may extend lead times, limit supplies, place products on allocation or increase prices due to commodity priceincreases, capacity constraints or other factors and could lead to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry. For example, due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced some supply constraints, including with respect to wafers and substrates. Additionally, the supply ofthese materials may be negatively impacted by increased trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, particularly China. In the eventthat we cannot timely obtain sufficient quantities of materials or at reasonable prices, the quality of the material deteriorates or we are not able topass on higher materials or energy costs to our customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.16Table of ContentsAdverse global economic conditions could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition andliquidity.A general slowdown in the global economy or in a particular region or industry, an increase in trade tensions with U.S. trading partners or atightening of the credit markets could negatively impact our business, financial condition and liquidity. Adverse global economic conditions have fromtime to time caused or exacerbated significant slowdowns in the industries and markets in which we operate, which have adversely affected ourbusiness and results of operations. In recent periods, investor and customer concerns about the global economic outlook, which have significantlyincreased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected market and business conditions in general. Macroeconomic weakness anduncertainty also make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue, gross margin and expenses, and may make it more difficult to raise orrefinance debt. An escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China has resulted in trade restrictions and increased tariffs that harm ourability to participate in Chinese markets or compete effectively with Chinese companies. Sustained uncertainty about, or worsening of, current globaleconomic conditions and further escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and its trading partners, especially China and possible decoupling ofthe U.S. and China economies, could result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to global trade. Such events may also (i) causeour customers and consumers to reduce, delay or forgo technology spending, (ii) result in customers sourcing products from other suppliers notsubject to such restrictions or tariffs, (iii) lead to the insolvency or consolidation of key suppliers and customers, and (iv) intensify pricing pressures.Any or all of these factors could negatively affect demand for our products and our business, financial condition and results of operations.Global political and economic conditions and other factors related to our international operations could adversely affect our business,financial condition and results of operations.A majority of our products are produced, sourced and sold internationally and our international revenue represents a significant percentage of ouroverall revenue. In addition, as of November 1, 2020, approximately 49% of our employees were located outside the U.S. Multiple factors relating toour international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditionand results of operations. These factors include:•changes in political, regulatory, legal or economic conditions or geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism, war or political or military coups, orcivil disturbances or political instability foreign and domestic;•restrictive governmental actions, such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and foreign investments, data privacy regulationsand trade protection measures, including increasing protectionism, import/export restrictions, import/export duties and quotas, tradesanctions and customs duties and tariffs, all of which have increased under the current U.S. administration;•difficulty in obtaining product distribution and support, and transportation delays;•potential inability to localize software products for a significant number of international markets;•difficulty in conducting due diligence with respect to business partners in certain international markets;•public health or safety concerns, medical epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19, and other natural- or man-made disasters;•nationalization of businesses and expropriation of assets; and•changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws.A significant legal risk associated with conducting business internationally is compliance with the various and differing laws and regulations of themany countries in which we do business. In addition, the laws in various countries are constantly evolving and may, in some cases, conflict with eachother. Although our policies prohibit us, our employees and our agents from engaging in unethical business practices, there can be no assurance thatall of our employees, distributors or other agents will refrain from acting in violation of our related anti-corruption or other policies and procedures.Any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our business is subject to various governmental regulations, and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significantexpense. If we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations, we may be forced to cease the manufacture and distribution ofcertain products, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.Our business is subject to various international laws and other legal requirements, including packaging, product content, labor and import/exportregulations, such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, and applicable executive orders. These laws, regulations and orders are complex,may change frequently and with limited notice, have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified under the current U.S.administration, especially in light of ongoing trade tensions17Table of Contentswith China. We may be required to incur significant expense to comply with, or to remedy violations of, these regulations. In addition, if our customersfail to comply with these regulations, we may be required to suspend sales to these customers, which could damage our reputation and negativelyimpact our results of operations. For example, Huawei, one of our customers, is subject to certain U.S. export restrictions, which has required us tosuspend sales to Huawei until we obtain licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce, which we may be unable to do so in a timely manner or atall. The U.S. government may also add additional Chinese companies to its restricted entity list and/or technologies to its list of prohibited exports toChina, all of which have and will adversely affect our ability to sell our products and our revenue. These restrictive governmental actions and anysimilar measures that may be imposed on U.S. companies by the Chinese or other governments will likely limit or prevent us from doing businesswith certain of our customers or suppliers and harm our ability to compete effectively or otherwise negatively affect our ability to sell our products, andadversely affect our business and results of operations.In addition, the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors must comply with various laws and adapt to changes in regulatoryrequirements as they occur. For example, if a country in which our products are manufactured or sold sets technical standards that are not widelyshared, it may require us to stop distributing our products commercially until they comply with such new standards, lead certain of our customers tosuspend imports of their products into that country, require manufacturers in that country to manufacture products with different technical standardsand disrupt cross-border manufacturing relationships, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations. If we fail to comply with these requirements, we could also be required to pay civil penalties or face criminal prosecution.Our products and operations are also subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well asregulation by other agencies, such as the FTC. If we fail to adequately address any of these rules or regulations, our business could be harmed.We are subject to risks associated with our distributors and other channel partners, including product inventory levels and product sell-through.We sell our products through a direct sales force and a select network of distributors and other channel partners globally. Sales to distributorsaccounted for 42% of our net revenue in the fiscal year ended November 1, 2020 and are subject to a number of risks, including:•fluctuations in demand based on our distributors’ product inventory levels and end customer demand in a given quarter;•our distributors and other channel partners are generally not subject to minimum sales requirements or any obligation to market our productsto their customers;•our distributors and other channel partners agreements are generally nonexclusive and may be terminated at any time without cause;•our lack of control over the timing of delivery of our products to end customers; and•our distributors and other channel partners may market and distribute competing products and may place greater emphasis on the sale ofthese products.In addition, we are selling our semiconductor products through an increasingly limited number of distributors, which exposes us to additionalcustomer concentration and related credit risks.We do not always have a direct relationship with the end customers of our products. As a result, our semiconductor products may be used inapplications for which they were not necessarily designed or tested, including, for example, medical devices, and they may not perform asanticipated in such applications. In such event, failure of even a small number of parts could result in significant liabilities to us, damage ourreputation and harm our business and results of operations.Our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team.Our success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team, and in particular, the services of Mr. Hock E.Tan, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Effective succession planning is also important for our long-term success. Failure to ensure effectivetransfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management could hinder our strategic planning and execution. None of our seniormanagement is bound by written employment contracts. In addition, we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our seniormanagement. The loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidlychanging market conditions in which we operate.18Table of ContentsIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, especially our engineering and technical personnel, we may not be able toexecute our business strategy effectively.Our future success depends on our ability to retain, attract and motivate qualified personnel. We also seek to acquire talented engineering andtechnical personnel (including cyber security experts), as well as effective sales professionals, through acquisitions we may make from time to timeor otherwise. As the source of our technological and product innovations, our engineering and technical personnel are a significant asset.Competition for these employees is significant in many areas of the world in which we operate, particularly in Silicon Valley and Southeast Asiawhere qualified engineers are in high demand. In addition, current or future immigration laws may make it more difficult to hire or retain qualifiedengineers, further limiting the pool of available talent. Further, our employees may decide not to continue working for us and may leave with little orno notice. We grant equity awards to the substantial majority of our employees and we believe these awards provide a powerful long-term retentionincentive to our employees; however, we may be incorrect in this assumption, particularly if there is a material and persistent decline in the price ofour common stock. In addition, we may be unable to obtain required stockholder approvals of future equity compensation plans needed to continuewith our current equity granting philosophy. As a result, we may be limited in our ability to grant equity-based incentives, which may impair our effortsto attract and retain necessary personnel. Any inability to retain, attract or motivate such personnel could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.We may pursue acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and dispositions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Our growth strategy includes acquiring or investing in businesses that offer complementary products, services and technologies, or enhance ourmarket coverage or technological capabilities.Any acquisitions we may undertake and their integration involve risks and uncertainties, such as:•unexpected delays, challenges and related expenses, and disruption of our business;•diversion of management’s attention from daily operations and the pursuit of other opportunities;•incurring significant restructuring charges and amortization expense, assuming liabilities (some of which may be unexpected) and ongoing ornew lawsuits related to the transaction or otherwise, potential impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, and increasingour expenses and working capital requirements;•the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at the acquired business, as well as implementing our own management information systems,operating systems and internal controls for the acquired operations;•our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired company’s products, financial disclosures, accountingpractices, legal, tax and other contingencies, compliance with local laws and regulations (and interpretations thereof) in the U.S. and multipleinternational jurisdictions;•additional acquisition-related debt, which could increase our leverage and potentially negatively affect our credit ratings resulting in morerestrictive borrowing terms or increased borrowing costs thereby limiting our ability to borrow;•dilution of stock ownership of existing stockholders;•difficulties integrating the acquired business or company and in managing and retaining acquired employees, vendors and customers; and•inaccuracies in our original estimates and assumptions used to assess a transaction, which may result in us not realizing the expectedfinancial or strategic benefits of any such transaction.In addition, U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals required in connection with an acquisition may take longer than anticipated to obtain, may notbe forthcoming or may contain burdensome conditions, which may jeopardize, delay or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction to us.From time to time, we may also seek to divest or wind down portions of our business, either acquired or otherwise, or we may exit minorityinvestments, any of which could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations. Such dispositions involve risks and uncertainties, includingour ability to sell such businesses on terms acceptable to us, or at all, disruption to other parts of our business, potential loss of employees orcustomers, or exposure to unanticipated liabilities or ongoing obligations to us following any such dispositions. In addition, dispositions may includethe transfer of technology and/or the licensing of certain IP rights to third-party purchasers, which could limit our ability to utilize such IP rights orassert these rights against such third-party purchasers or other third parties.19Table of ContentsWe may be involved in legal proceedings, including IP, anti-competition and securities litigation, employee-related claims and regulatoryinvestigations, which could, among other things, divert efforts of management and result in significant expense and loss of our IP rights.We are often involved in legal proceedings, including cases involving our IP rights and those of others, anti-competition and commercial matters,acquisition-related suits, securities class action suits, employee-related claims and other actions. From time to time, we may also be involved orrequired to participate in regulatory investigations or inquiries, such as the ongoing investigation by the FTC into certain of our contracting andbusiness practices, which may evolve into legal or other administrative proceedings. Growing public concern over concentration of economic powerin corporations is likely to result in increased anti-competition legislation, regulation and enforcement activity. Litigation or settlement of such actions,regardless of their merit, or involvement in regulatory investigations or inquiries, can be costly, lengthy, complex and time consuming, diverting theattention and energies of our management and technical personnel.The industries in which we operate are characterized by companies holding large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secretsand by the vigorous pursuit, protection and enforcement of IP rights, including actions by patent-holding companies that do not make or sell products.From time to time, third parties assert against us and our customers and distributors their IP rights to technologies that are important to our business.For example, in August 2020 judgment was entered against Broadcom and Apple for infringement of certain patents pursuant to which CaliforniaInstitute of Technology was awarded past damages of $270.2 million from Broadcom and $837.8 million from Apple (plus, in each case, interestthereon from the date of the judgment), for which Apple is seeking indemnification from Broadcom. Although we are appealing this judgment, thereare no assurances that we will be successful.Many of our customer agreements, and in some cases our asset sale agreements, and/or the laws of certain jurisdictions may require us toindemnify our customers or purchasers for third-party IP infringement claims, including costs to defend those claims, and payment of damages in thecase of adverse rulings. However, our CMs and suppliers may or may not be required to indemnify us should we or our customers be subject to suchthird-party claims. Claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing businesswith us. If any pending or future proceedings result in an adverse outcome, we could be required to:•cease the manufacture, use or sale of the infringing products, processes or technology and/or make changes to our processes or products;•pay substantial damages for past, present and future use of the infringing technology, including up to treble damages if willful infringement isfound;•pay fines or disgorge profits or other payments, and/or cease certain conduct and/or modify our contracting or business practices, inconnection with any unfavorable resolution of a governmental investigation;•expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology;•license technology from the third-party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;•enter into cross-licenses with our competitors, which could weaken our overall IP portfolio and our ability to compete in particular productcategories;•pay substantial damages to our direct or end customers to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non-infringing technology; or•relinquish IP rights associated with one or more of our patent claims.Any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, we may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees, or former directors or employees of companies thatwe have acquired, in connection with litigation or regulatory investigations. These liabilities could be substantial and may include, among otherthings, the cost of defending lawsuits against these individuals, as well as stockholder derivative suits; the cost of government, law enforcement orregulatory investigations; civil or criminal fines and penalties; legal and other expenses; and expenses associated with the remedial measure, if any,which may be imposed.Our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations.Our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annualbasis and are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to many of the risks described elsewhere in this “RiskFactors” section, these factors include, among others:20Table of Contents•customer concentration and the gain or loss of significant customers;•the timing of launches by our customers of new product in which our products are included and changes in end-user demand for ourcustomers’ the products;•fluctuations in the levels of component or product inventories held by our customers;•the shift to cloud-based IT solutions and services, such as hyperscale computing, which may adversely affect the timing and volume of salesof our products for use in traditional enterprise data centers;•the timing of new software contracts and renewals, as well as the timing of any terminations of software contracts that require us to refund tocustomers any pre-paid amounts under the contract;•our ability to timely develop, introduce and market new products and technologies;•the timing and extent of our software license and subscription revenue, and other non-product revenue;•new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors;•seasonality or other fluctuations in demand in our markets;•timing and amount of research and development and related new product expenditures, and the timing of receipt of any research anddevelopment grant monies; and•timing of any regulatory changes, particularly with respect to trade sanctions and customs duties and tariffs, and tax reform.The foregoing factors are often difficult to predict, and these, as well as other factors, could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annualoperating results. In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature. Any failure to adjust spending quicklyenough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations. As a result,we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful or a reliable indicator of our futureperformance. If our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, a significantdecline in the trading price of our common stock may occur, which may happen immediately or over time.Failure to adjust our manufacturing and supply chain to accurately meet customer demand could adversely affect our results ofoperations.We make significant decisions, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, levels of relianceon contract manufacturing and outsourcing, internal fabrication utilization and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customerrequirements, which may not be accurate.During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have moved largely to a build to order model and have extended customer lead times substantially in light ofglobal economic uncertainty and supply chain challenges. More typically, however, to ensure the availability of our products we start manufacturingbased on customer forecasts, which are not binding. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales thatmay be substantially lower than expected. If actual demand for our products is lower than forecast, we may also experience higher inventory carryingand operating costs and product obsolescence. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overheadexpenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income.Conversely, customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice. We may be unable to secure sufficient materials or contractmanufacturing or test capacity to meet such increases in demand. This could damage our customer relationships, reduce revenue growth andmargins, subject us to additional liabilities, harm our reputation, and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities.We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns.The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change and price erosion, evolvingtechnical standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles (for semiconductors and for many of the end products in which theyare used) and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. From time to time, these factors, together with changes in general economicconditions, cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry in general, and in our business in particular. Periods of industry downturns havebeen characterized by diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment, under-utilization ofmanufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices. We expect our business to continue to be subjectto cyclical downturns even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable. If we cannot offset industry or market downturns, our net revenuemay decline and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer.21Table of ContentsWinning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significantexpense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenue.Our semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes, known as “design wins”. These selectionprocesses are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of asingle customer opportunity. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of aparticular product. This can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection processes.Winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer. A delay or cancellation of a customer’s plans could materially and adverselyaffect our financial results, as we incur significant expense in the design process and may generate little or no revenue from it. In addition, the timingof design wins is unpredictable and implementing production for a major design win, or multiple design wins at the same time, may strain ourresources and those of our CMs. In such event, we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources and incur additional costs andexpenses. Further, often customers will only purchase limited numbers of evaluation units until they qualify the products and/or the manufacturingline for those products. The qualification process can take significant time and resources. Delays in qualification or failure to qualify our products maycause a customer to discontinue use of our products and result in a significant loss of revenue. Finally, customers could choose at any time to stopusing our products or could fail to successfully market and sell their products, which could reduce demand for our products, and cause us to holdexcess inventory, materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are exacerbated by the factthat many of our products, and the end products into which our products are incorporated, often have very short life cycles.Competition in our industries could prevent us from growing our revenue.The industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards,changes in customer requirements, often aggressive pricing practices and, in some cases, new delivery methods. We expect competition in theseindustries to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings or as new competitors enter our markets.Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, a larger installed customer base, larger technical staffs, moreestablished relationships with vendors or suppliers, or greater manufacturing, distribution, financial, research and development, technical andmarketing resources than us. We also face competition from numerous smaller companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highlyfragmented software industry, open source authors who may provide software and IP for free, competitors who may offer their products through try-and-buy or freemium models, and customers who may develop competing products.In addition, the trend toward consolidation is changing the competitive landscape. We expect this trend to continue, which may result incombined competitors having greater resources than us. Some of our competitors may also receive financial and other support from their homecountry government or may have a greater presence in key markets, a larger customer base, a more comprehensive IP portfolio or better patentprotection than us.The actions of our competitors, in the areas of pricing and product bundling in particular, could have a substantial adverse impact on us. Further,competitors may leverage their superior market position, as well as IP or other proprietary information, including interface, interoperability or technicalinformation, in new and emerging technologies and platforms that may inhibit our ability to compete effectively. If we are unable to competesuccessfully, we may lose market share for our products or incur significant reduction in our gross margins, either of which could have a materialadverse effect on our business and results of operations.A prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facilities, research and development facilities, warehouses or other significant operations,or those of our suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Although we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model, we also rely on our own manufacturing facilities, in particular inFort Collins, Colorado, Singapore, and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania. We use these internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative andproprietary processes. Our Fort Collins and Breinigsville facilities are the sole sources for the FBAR components used in many of our wirelessdevices and for the indium phosphide-based wafers used in our fibre optics products, respectively. Many of our facilities, and those of our CMs andsuppliers, are located in California and the Pacific Rim region, which have above average seismic activity and severe weather activity. In addition, asignificant majority of our research and development personnel are located the Czech Republic, India, Israel, Singapore and the U.S., with theexpertise of the personnel at each such location tending to be focused on one or two specific areas, and our primary warehouse is in Malaysia.22Table of ContentsA prolonged disruption at or shut-down of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or warehouses for any reason, especially our Colorado,Singapore, Malaysia and Pennsylvania facilities, or those of our CMs or suppliers, due to natural- or man-made disasters or other events outside ofour control, such as equipment malfunction or widespread outbreaks of acute illness, including COVID-19, would limit our capacity to meet customerdemands and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment, if necessary, were found. Any such event would likelydisrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand, expose us to claimsby our customers, result in significant expense to repair or replace our affected facilities, and, in some instances, could significantly curtail ourresearch and development efforts in a particular product area or target market. As a result, we could forgo revenue opportunities, potentially losemarket share, damage our customer relationships and be subject to litigation and additional liabilities, all of which could materially and adverselyaffect our business. Although we purchase insurance to mitigate certain losses, such insurance often carries a high deductible amount and anyuninsured losses could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, even if we were able to promptly resume production of our affectedproducts, if our customers cannot timely resume their own manufacturing following such an event, they may cancel or scale back their orders from usand this may in turn adversely affect our results of operations. Such events could also result in increased fixed costs relative to the revenue wegenerate and adversely affect our results of operations.We may be unable to maintain appropriate manufacturing capacity or product yields at our own manufacturing facilities, which couldadversely affect our relationships with our customers, and our business, financial condition and results of operations.We must maintain appropriate capacity and product yields at our own manufacturing facilities to meet anticipated customer demand. From timeto time, this requires us to invest in expansion or improvements of those facilities, which often involves substantial cost and other risks. Suchexpanded manufacturing capacity may still be insufficient, or may not come online soon enough, to meet customer demand and we may have to putcustomers on product allocation, forgo sales or lose customers as a result. Conversely, if we overestimate customer demand, we would experienceexcess capacity and fixed costs at these facilities will not be fully absorbed, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations. Similarly,reduced product yields, due to design or manufacturing issues or otherwise, may involve significant time and cost to remedy and cause delays in ourability to supply product to our customers, all of which could cause us to forgo sales, incur liabilities or lose customers, and harm our results ofoperations.In addition, future government restrictions imposed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that limit our manufacturing capabilities could severelyimpact our ability to manufacture our proprietary products, adversely affecting our wireless business.Any failure of our IT systems or one or more of our corporate infrastructure vendors to provide necessary services could have a materialadverse effect on our business.Our business depends on various IT systems and outsourced IT services. We rely on third-party vendors to provide critical corporateinfrastructure services and to adequately address cyber security threats to their own systems. Services provided by these third parties includeservices related to financial reporting, product orders and shipping, human resources, benefit plan administration, IT network development andnetwork monitoring. While we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us, any award may beinsufficient to cover the actual costs incurred by us and, as a result of a vendor’s failure to perform, we may be unable to collect any damages.Any failure of these internal or third-party systems and services to operate effectively could disrupt our operations and could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our gross margin is dependent on a number of factors, including our product mix, price erosion, acquisitions we may make, level ofcapacity utilization and commodity prices.Our gross margin is highly dependent on product mix, which is susceptible to seasonal and other fluctuations in our markets. A shift in sales mixaway from our higher margin products, as well as the timing and amount of our software licensing and non-product revenue, could adversely affectour future gross margin percentages. In addition, increased competition and the existence of product alternatives, more complex engineeringrequirements, lower demand or reductions in our technological lead compared to our competitors, and other factors may lead to further price erosion,lower revenue and lower margin.In addition, semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment, leading to high fixed costs, including depreciation expense. Ifwe are unable to utilize our owned manufacturing facilities at a high level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed,resulting in higher average unit costs and a lower gross margin. Furthermore, fluctuations in commodity prices could negatively impact our margins.We do not hedge our exposure to commodity prices, some of which are very volatile, and sudden or prolonged increases in commodities prices mayadversely affect our gross margin.23Table of ContentsOur gross margin may also be adversely affected if businesses or companies that we acquire have different gross margin profiles and byexpenses related to such acquisitions.We utilize a significant amount of IP in our business. If we are unable or fail to protect our IP, our business could be adversely affected.Our success depends in part upon protecting our IP. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of IP rights, including patents, copyrights,trademarks and trade secrets, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants. We may berequired to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our IP rights, including unauthorized use of our products, the usage rates of thesoftware seat licenses and subscriptions that we sell, and even with significant expenditures, we may not be able to protect the IP rights that arevaluable to our business. We are unable to predict or assure that:•our IP rights will not lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, or, in the case of third-party IP rights licensed to us, be licensed toothers;•our IP rights will provide competitive advantages to us;•rights previously granted by third parties to IP licensed or assigned to us, including portfolio cross-licenses, will not hamper our ability toassert our IP rights or hinder the settlement of currently pending or future disputes;•any of our pending or future patent, trademark or copyright applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought;•our IP rights will be enforced in certain jurisdictions where competition may be intense or where legal protection may be weak; or•we have sufficient IP rights to protect our products or our business.Effective IP protection may be unavailable or more limited in other jurisdictions, relative to those protections available in the U.S., and may not beapplied for or may be abandoned in one or more relevant jurisdictions. In addition, when patents expire, we lose the protection and competitiveadvantages they provided to us.We also generate revenue from licensing royalty payments and from technology claim settlements relating to certain of our IP. Licensing of our IPrights, particularly exclusive licenses, may limit our ability to assert those IP rights against third parties, including the licensee of those rights. Inaddition, we may acquire companies with IP that is subject to licensing obligations to other third parties. These licensing obligations may extend toour own IP following any such acquisition and may limit our ability to assert our IP rights. From time to time, we pursue litigation to assert our IPrights, including, in some cases, against our customers and suppliers. Claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers andmight deter future customers from doing business with us. Conversely, third parties may pursue IP litigation against us, including as a result of our IPlicensing business. An adverse decision in such types of legal action could limit our ability to assert our IP rights and limit the value of our technology,including the loss of opportunities to sell or license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments, which could otherwise negatively impactour business, financial condition and results of operations.From time to time, we may need to obtain additional IP licenses or renew existing license agreements. We are unable to predict whether theselicense agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms or at all.If our software products do not remain compatible with ever-changing operating environments, platforms, or third-party products,demand for our products and services could decrease, which could materially adversely affect our business.We may be required to make substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with operating systems, systems software andcomputer hardware used by our customers or to provide our customers with desired features or capabilities. We must also continually address thechallenges of dynamic and accelerating market trends and competitive developments, such as the emergence of advanced persistent threats in thesecurity space to compete effectively. There can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt our products in response to these developments.Further, our software solutions interact with a variety of software and hardware developed by third parties. If we lose access to third-party codeand specifications for the development of code, this could negatively impact our ability to develop compatible software. In addition, if softwareproviders and hardware manufacturers, including some of our largest vendors, adopt new policies restricting the use or availability of their code ortechnical documentation for their operating systems, applications, or hardware, or otherwise impose unfavorable terms and conditions for suchaccess, this could result in higher research and development costs for the enhancement and modification of our existing products or development ofnew products. Any additional restrictions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flow.Failure to enter into software license agreements on a satisfactory basis could materially adversely affect our business.24Table of ContentsMany of our existing customers have multi-year enterprise software license agreements, some of which involve substantial aggregate feeamounts. Customer renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of customer satisfaction with oursolutions or customer support, customer budgets and the pricing of our solutions as compared with the solutions offered by our competitors, any ofwhich may cause our revenue to grow more slowly than expected, if at all. The failure to renew customer agreements of similar scope, on terms thatare commercially attractive to us, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flow.Certain software that we use in our products is licensed from third parties and may not be available to us in the future, which may delayproduct development and production or cause us to incur additional expense.Some of our solutions contain software licensed from third parties, some of which may not be available to us in the future on terms that areacceptable to us or allow our products to remain competitive. The loss of these licenses or the inability to maintain any of them on commerciallyacceptable terms could delay development of future products or the enhancement of existing products.Certain software we use is from open source code sources, which, under certain circumstances could materially adversely affect ourbusiness, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.Some of our products contain software from open source code sources, the use of which may subject us to certain conditions, including theobligation to offer such products for no cost or to make the proprietary source code of those products publicly available. Further, although some opensource vendors provide warranty and support agreements, it is common for such software to be available “as-is” with no warranty, indemnity orsupport. Although we monitor our use of such open source code to avoid subjecting our products to unintended conditions, such use, under certaincircumstances, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and cash flow, including if we are required totake remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts.We are subject to warranty claims, product recalls and product liability.From time to time, we may be subject to warranty or product liability claims that may lead to significant expense. Our customer contracts typicallycontain warranty and indemnification provisions, and in certain cases may also contain liquidated damages provisions, relating to product qualityissues. The potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant, and in some cases, including in agreements with some of our largestcustomers, are potentially unlimited. Any such liabilities may greatly exceed any revenue we receive from the relevant products. Costs, payments ordamages incurred or paid by us in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially adversely affect ourfinancial condition and results of operations. We may also be exposed to such claims as a result of any acquisition we may undertake in the future.Product liability insurance is subject to significant deductibles and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate toprotect against all such claims, or we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. For example, it is possible for one of our customers torecall a product containing one of our semiconductor devices. In such an event, we may incur significant costs and expenses, including amongothers, replacement costs, contract damage claims from our customers and reputational harm. Although we maintain reserves for reasonablyestimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance, our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims.Conversely, in some cases, amounts we reserve may ultimately exceed our actual liability for particular claims and may need to be reversed.The complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expense or undetected defects or bugs, which could adversely affectthe market acceptance of new products, damage our reputation with current or prospective customers, and materially and adversely affectour operating costs.Highly complex products, such as those we offer, may contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions, softwaredocumentation or enhancements are released, or their release may be delayed due to unforeseen difficulties during product development. If any ofour products or third-party components used in our products, contain defects or bugs, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, we may notbe able to successfully design workarounds. Furthermore, if any of these problems are not discovered until after we have commenced commercialproduction or deployment of a new product, we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall, repair or replacementcosts. Significant technical challenges also arise with our software products because our customers license and deploy our products across a varietyof computer platforms and integrate them with a number of third party software applications and databases. As a result, if there is system-wide failureor an actual or perceived breach of information integrity, security or availability occurs in one of our end-user customer’s system, it may be difficult todetermine which product is at fault and we could ultimately be harmed by the failure of another supplier’s product. Consequently, our reputation maybe damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customersand attract new customers. To resolve these problems, we may have to invest significant capital and other resources and we would likely lose, orexperience a delay in, market acceptance of the affected25Table of Contentsproduct or products. These problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others. For example, if a delay in the manufacture anddelivery of our products causes the delay of a customer’s end-product delivery, we may be required, under the terms of our agreement with thatcustomer, to compensate the customer for the adverse effects of such delays. As a result, our financial results could be materially adversely affected.We make substantial investments in research and development and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.The industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, changes in customer requirements, frequent new productintroductions and enhancements, short product cycles and evolving industry standards, and new delivery methods. In addition, semiconductorproducts transition over time to increasingly smaller line width geometries and failure to successfully transition to smaller geometry processtechnologies could impair our competitive position. In order to remain competitive, we have made, and expect to continue to make, significantinvestments in research and development. If we fail to develop new and enhanced products and technologies, if we focus on technologies that do notbecome widely adopted, or if new competitive technologies that we do not support become widely accepted, demand for our products may bereduced. Increased investments in research and development or unsuccessful research and development efforts could cause our cost structure tofall out of alignment with demand for our products, which would have a negative impact on our financial results.We collect, use, store, or otherwise process personal information, which subjects us to privacy and data security laws and contractualcommitments, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and commitments could harm our business.We collect, use and store (collectively, “process”) a high volume, variety and velocity of certain personal information in connection with theoperation of our business. This creates various levels of privacy risks across different parts of our business, depending on the type of personalinformation, the jurisdiction in question and the purpose of their processing. The personal information we process is subject to an increasing numberof federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security, as well as contractual commitments. Privacy legislationand other data protection regulations, enforcement and policy activity in this area are expanding rapidly in many jurisdictions and creating a complexregulatory compliance environment. The cost of complying with and implementing these privacy-related and data governance measures could besignificant as they may create additional burdensome security, business process, business record or data localization requirements. Concerns aboutgovernment interference, sovereignty, expanding privacy, cyber security and data governance legislation could adversely affect our customers andour products and services, particularly in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and our own data management practices. The theft, loss or misuse ofpersonal data collected, used, stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased business and security costs orcosts related to defending legal claims. Any inadvertent failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy, data governance or cyber securityobligations may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, substantial fines and damages, and could cause our customers to lose trust inus, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.We are subject to environmental, health and safety laws, which could increase our costs, restrict our operations and require expendituresthat could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We are subject to a variety of international laws and regulations relating to the use, disposal, clean-up of and human exposure to hazardousmaterials. Compliance with environmental, health and safety requirements could, among other things, require us to modify our manufacturingprocesses, restrict our ability to expand our facilities, or require us to acquire pollution control equipment, all of which can be very costly. Any failureby us to comply with such requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of the manufacture of our products and could result in litigationagainst us and the payment of significant fines and damages by us in the event of a significant adverse judgment. In addition, complying with anycleanup or remediation obligations for which we are or become responsible could be costly and have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition and results of operations.Changing requirements relating to the materials composition of our semiconductor products, including the restrictions on lead and certain othersubstances in electronic products sold in various countries, including the U.S., China and Japan, and in the European Union, increase the complexityand costs of our product design and procurement operations and may require us to re-engineer our products. Such re-engineering may result inexcess inventory or other additional costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We may also experience claims fromemployees from time to time with regard to exposure to hazardous materials or other workplace related environmental claims.Social and environmental responsibility regulations, policies and provisions, as well as customer demand, may make our supply chainmore complex and may adversely affect our relationships with customers.There is an increasing focus on corporate social and environmental responsibility in the semiconductor industry, particularly with OEMs thatmanufacture consumer electronics. A number of our customers have adopted, or may adopt,26Table of Contentsprocurement policies that include social and environmental responsibility provisions that their suppliers should comply with, or they may seek toinclude such provisions in their procurement terms and conditions. An increasing number of participants in the semiconductor industry are alsojoining voluntary social responsibility initiatives such as the U.N. Global Compact, a voluntary initiative for businesses to develop, implement anddisclose sustainability policies and practices. These social and environmental responsibility provisions and initiatives are subject to change, can beunpredictable, and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, given the complexity of our supply chain and our significant outsourcedmanufacturing. If we are unable to comply, or are unable to cause our suppliers or CMs to comply, with such policies or provisions, a customer maystop purchasing products from us, and may take legal action against us, which could harm our reputation, revenue and results of operations.In addition, as part of their corporate social and environmental responsibility programs, an increasing number of OEMs are seeking to sourceproducts that do not contain minerals sourced from areas where proceeds from the sale of such minerals are likely to be used to fund armedconflicts, such as in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used in themanufacture of semiconductor devices, including our products. As a result, we may face difficulties in satisfying these customers’ demands, whichmay harm our sales and operating results.The average selling prices of semiconductor products in our markets have often decreased rapidly and may do so in the future, whichcould harm our revenue and gross profit.The semiconductor products we develop and sell are used for high volume applications. As a result, the prices of those products have oftendecreased rapidly. Gross profit on our products may be negatively affected by, among other things, pricing pressures from our customers. In the past,we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by us orour competitors and other factors. In addition, some of our customer agreements provide for volume-based pricing and product pricing roadmaps,which can also reduce the average selling prices of our products over time. Our margins and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset anyreductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes, reducing manufacturing costs, or developing new and higher value-addedproducts on a timely basis.A breach of our security systems may have a material adverse effect on our business.Our security systems are designed to maintain the physical security of our facilities and protect our customers’, suppliers’ and employees’confidential information, as well as our own proprietary information. However, we are also dependent on a number of third-party cloud-based andother service providers of critical corporate infrastructure services relating to, among other things, human resources, electronic communicationservices and certain finance functions, and we are, out of necessity, dependent on the security systems of these providers. In addition, all software,including the security technologies produced by us have had occasionally in the past and may have in the future vulnerabilities that if left unmanagedcould reduce the overall level of security.Accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access of our facilities, our information systems or the systems of our serviceproviders, or the existence of computer viruses or malware in our or their data or software could expose us to a risk of information loss andmisappropriation of proprietary and confidential information, including information relating to our products or customers and the personal informationof our employees. We have, from time to time, also been subject to, or attempts of, unauthorized network intrusions and malware on our own ITnetworks. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote access to our networks and systems has increased substantially. While we have takensteps to secure our networks and systems, we may be more vulnerable to a successful cyber-attack or information security incident while ourworkforce works remotely.Certain of our software products are intended to manage and secure IT infrastructures and environments, and as a result, we expect theseproducts to be ongoing targets of cyber security attacks. Open source code or other third-party software used in these products could also betargeted. Additionally, we use third-party data centers, which may also be subject to hacking or accidental incidents. Although we continually seek toimprove our countermeasures to prevent such incidents, we may be unable to anticipate every scenario and it is possible that certain cyber threats orvulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack or an accidental incident on us and our customers. Cyber securityattacks could require significant expenditures of our capital and diversion of our resources. Additionally, efforts by malicious cyber actors or otherscould cause interruptions, delays or cessation of our product licensing, or modification of our software, which could cause us to lose existing orpotential customers. A successful cyber security attack involving our products and IT infrastructure could also negatively impact the marketperception of their effectiveness and adversely affect our reputation, relationship with our customers and our financial results.Any theft, accidental loss or misuse of confidential, personally identifiable or proprietary information could disrupt our business and result in,among other things, unfavorable publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of our trade secrets and other competitive information, difficulty inmarketing our products, allegations by our customers that we have not performed27Table of Contentsour contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for liabilities and damages related to the theft or misuse ofsuch information, as well as fines and other sanctions resulting from any related breaches of data privacy regulations (such as the General DataProtection Regulation), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability and financial condition. Interruptions in ouroperations and services or disruptions to the functionality provided by our software, including the operation of our global civilian cyber intelligencethreat network, could adversely impact our revenues or cause customers to cease doing business with us. In addition, our business would be harmedif any of the events of this nature caused our customers and potential customers to believe our services are unreliable. Our operations are dependentupon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effecton our operations. Since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems or to otherwise sabotage them, change frequently and areoften not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventativemeasures.Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could result in losses.We operate global businesses and our consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars. However, some of the revenue and expenses ofour foreign subsidiaries are denominated in local currencies. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates against the U.S. dollar could result in substantialchanges in reported revenues and operating results due to the foreign exchange impact of translating these transactions into U.S. dollars.In the normal course of business, we employ various hedging strategies to partially mitigate these risks, including the use of derivativeinstruments. These strategies may not be effective in protecting us against the effects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. As a result,fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could result in financial losses.Risks Related to Our TaxesChanges in tax legislation or policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.Corporate tax reform, anti-base-erosion rules and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many jurisdictions. As a result, policiesregarding corporate income and other taxes in numerous jurisdictions are under heightened scrutiny and tax reform legislation has been, and willlikely continue to be, proposed or enacted in a number of jurisdictions in which we operate.After enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Reform Act”), most of our income is taxable in the U.S. with a significantportion taxable under the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) regime. Beginning in fiscal year 2027, the deduction allowable under theGILTI regime will decrease from 50% to 37.5%, which will increase the effective tax rate imposed on our income. Further, if the U.S. tax rateincreases or the deduction allowable under the GILTI regime is further reduced or eliminated, our provision for income taxes, net income, and cashflows would be adversely impactedIn addition, many countries are implementing legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the Organisation forEconomic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize andmodernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentivepractices. The OECD is also continuing discussions surrounding fundamental changes in allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in whichcompanies do business, as well as the implementation of a global minimum tax (namely the “Pillar One” and “Pillar Two” proposals). As a result ofthis heightened scrutiny, prior decisions by tax authorities regarding treatments and positions of corporate income taxes could be subject toenforcement activities, and legislative investigation and inquiry, which could also result in changes in tax policies or prior tax rulings. Any suchchanges may also result in the taxes we previously paid being subject to change. Further, many jurisdictions have passed, and may pass additionallegislation, intended to alleviate the economic burdens of COVID-19 and to fund economic recovery and growth, including various temporary taxincentives or relief and restricted tax measures, which could result in future tax increases. We cannot predict the extent to which the COVID-19pandemic will impact our tax liabilities and are continuing to evaluate the impact of the new legislation to our financial statements.Any substantial changes in domestic or international corporate tax policies, regulations or guidance, enforcement activities or legislativeinitiatives may materially adversely affect our business, the amount of taxes we are required to pay and our financial condition and results ofoperations generally.If the tax incentives or tax holiday arrangements we have negotiated change or cease to be in effect or applicable for any reason, or if ourassumptions and interpretations regarding tax laws and incentives or holiday arrangements prove to be incorrect, our corporate incometaxes could significantly increase.Our operations are currently structured to benefit from the various tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investmentor employment. For example, absent our principal tax incentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board, which is scheduled to expire in2025, the corporate income tax rate that would otherwise apply to our Singapore taxable income would be 17%. We also have a tax holiday on ourqualifying income in Malaysia, which is scheduled28Table of Contentsto expire in fiscal year 2028. Each tax incentive and tax holiday is subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions and may, insome instances, be amended or terminated prior to their scheduled termination date by the relevant governmental authority. If we cannot, or elect notto, comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive or tax holiday, we could, in some instances, be required to refundpreviously realized material tax benefits, or if such tax incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to its expiration absent a new incentive applying, wewill lose the related tax benefits earlier than scheduled. In addition, we may be required, or elect, to modify our operational structure and tax strategyin order to keep an incentive, which could result in a decrease in the benefits of the incentive. Our tax incentives and tax holiday, before taking intoconsideration the effects of the 2017 Tax Reform Act and other indirect tax provisions, increased the benefit from income taxes by approximately$833 million in the aggregate and increased diluted net income per share by $1.98 for fiscal year 2020.Our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority, and if our assumptions about tax andother laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded, we could suffer material adverse tax and other financialconsequences, which would increase our expenses, reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows.Our benefit from income taxes and overall cash tax costs are affected by a number of factors that could materially, adversely affectfinancial results.Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide benefit from income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are manytransactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Additionally, our calculations of income taxes payable currently and on a deferredbasis are based on our interpretations of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we are required to file tax returns. Although we believe ourtax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different than what isreflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.Our benefit from income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by numerous factors including:•reorganization or restructuring of our businesses, tangible and intangible assets, outstanding indebtedness and corporate structure;•jurisdictional mix of our income and assets;•changes in the allocation of income and expenses, including adjustments related to changes in our corporate structure, acquisitions or taxlaw;•changes in U.S and foreign tax laws and regulations, changes to the taxation of earnings of foreign subsidiaries, taxation of U.S. incomegenerated from foreign sources, the deductibility of expenses attributable to income and foreign tax credit rules;•tax effects of increases in non-deductible employee compensation; and•changes in tax accounting rules or principles and in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.We have adopted transfer pricing policies that call for the provision of services, the sale of products, the arrangement of financing and the grantof licenses from one affiliate to another at prices that we believe are negotiated on an arm’s length basis. Our taxable income is dependent uponacceptance by local authorities that our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing are on an arm’s length basis. Due to inconsistenciesin application of the arm’s length standard among taxing authorities, as well as lack of comprehensive treaty-based protection, transfer pricingchallenges by tax authorities could, if successful, result in adjustments for prior or future years. The effects of any such changes could subject us tohigher taxes and our earnings, results of operations and cash flow would be adversely affected.In addition, we are subject to, and are under, tax audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax againstus. Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our income taxprovisions and accruals. The ultimate result of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows in the periodor periods for which that determination is made.The Internal Revenue Service may not agree that prior to our redomiciliation into the U.S., our predecessor, Broadcom Limited shouldhave been treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.Although Broadcom Limited, our predecessor, was a Singapore entity, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) may assert that following ouracquisition of BRCM, Broadcom Limited should have been treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section7874 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). If the IRS were to determine that under Section 7874 of the Code, the formershareholders of BRCM held at least 60% of the vote or29Table of Contentsvalue of the ordinary shares of Broadcom Limited immediately after our acquisition of BRCM, such percentage referred to as the “Section 7874Percentage”, Broadcom Limited would be treated as a “surrogate foreign corporation” and several limitations could then apply to BRCM. Forexample, BRCM would be prohibited from using its net operating losses, foreign tax credits or other tax attributes to offset the income or gainrecognized by reason of the transfer of property to a foreign related person during the 10-year period following our acquisition of BRCM or anyincome received or accrued during such period by reason of a license of any property by BRCM to a foreign related person. Moreover, in such case,Section 4985 of the Code and rules related thereto would impose an excise tax on the value of certain stock compensation held directly or indirectlyby certain BRCM “disqualified individuals” (including former officers and directors of BRCM) at a rate equal to 15%, but only if a gain is otherwiserecognized by BRCM former shareholders as a result of our acquisition of BRCM. If the IRS were to determine the Section 7874 Percentage was80% or more, then Broadcom Limited would be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.While we believe the Section 7874 Percentage was significantly less than 60%, determining the Section 7874 Percentage is complex and issubject to factual and legal uncertainties. There can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with our position.Risks Related to Our IndebtednessOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to execute our business strategy.As of November 1, 2020, the aggregate indebtedness under our senior notes and term loans was $35,610 million and $5,888 million,respectively. We expect to maintain significant levels of indebtedness going forward.Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences including:•increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;•exposing us to interest rate risk due to our variable rate term facilities, which we do not typically hedge against;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the economy and the semiconductor industry;•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness;•making it more difficult to borrow additional funds in the future to fund growth, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures and otherpurposes; and•potentially requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducingthe availability of our cash flow to fund our other business needs.In addition, our variable rate indebtedness use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the effective interest rate. LIBOR is being phased out andthe consequences of changing to alternative reference rates could increase the cost of our variable rate indebtedness.We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the U.S. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, plannedasset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, reserve mix andcommodity pricing levels could also be considered by the rating agencies. While we are focused on maintaining investment grade ratings from theseagencies, we may be unable to do so. Any downgrade in our credit rating or the ratings of our indebtedness, or adverse conditions in the debt capitalmarkets, could:•adversely affect the trading price of, or market for, our debt securities;•increase interest expense under our term facilities;•increase the cost of, and adversely affect our ability to refinance, our existing debt; and•adversely affect our ability to raise additional debt.The instruments governing our indebtedness impose certain restrictions on our business.The instruments governing our indebtedness contain certain covenants imposing restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect ourability to operate our business, to plan for, or react to, changes in the market conditions or our capital needs and may limit our ability to takeadvantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. The restrictions placed on us include maintenance of an interest coverage ratio andlimitations on our ability to incur certain secured debt, enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions and consolidate, merge, sell or otherwisedispose of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, the instruments contain customary events of default upon the occurrence of which, afterany applicable grace period, the indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. In such event, we may not have sufficient availablecash to repay such debt at the time it becomes due, or be able to refinance such debt on acceptable terms or at all. Any of the foregoing couldmaterially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.30Table of ContentsServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay oursubstantial debt.Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, and to refinance our debt, depends on our future performance,which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in thefuture sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our current indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capitalexpenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delayinginvestments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive.Our ability to refinance our outstanding indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at suchtime. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms when needed, which could result in adefault on our indebtedness.Risks Related to Owning Our Common StockAt times, our stock price has been volatile and it may fluctuate substantially in the future, which could result in substantial losses for ourinvestors as well as class action litigation against us and our management which could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert ourmanagement’s attention and resources.The trading price of our common stock has, at times, fluctuated significantly and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to any of therisk factors listed in this “Risk Factors” section, and others, including:•issuance of new or updated research or other reports by securities analysts;•fluctuations in the valuation and results of operations of our significant customers as well as companies perceived by investors to becomparable to us;•announcements of proposed acquisitions by us or our competitors;•announcements of, or expectations of, additional debt or equity financing transactions;•stock price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our common stock;•issuance, and subsequent sale, of common stock upon conversion of our 8.00% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A(“Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock”);•hedging or arbitrage trading activity involving our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock or common stock; and•unsubstantiated news reports or other inaccurate publicity regarding us or our business.These fluctuations are often unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well asgeneral economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or currency fluctuations, may negatively impact themarket price of our common stock. You may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment. In the past,companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be thetarget of this type of litigation in the future. We are also the subject of a number of lawsuits stemming from our acquisitions. Securities litigationagainst us, including the lawsuits related to such transactions, could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from otherbusiness concerns, which could seriously harm our business.A substantial amount of our stock is held by a small number of large investors and significant sales of our common stock by one or moreof these holders could cause our stock price to fall.As of September 30, 2020, we believe 11 of our 20 largest holders of common stock were active institutional investors who held approximately33% of our outstanding shares of common stock in the aggregate, with Capital World Investors being our largest stockholder with approximately 10%of our outstanding shares of common stock. These investors may sell their shares at any time for a variety of reasons and such sales could depressthe market price of our common stock. In addition, any such sales of our common stock by these entities could also impair our ability to raise capitalthrough the sale of additional equity securities.31Table of ContentsThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends.Our Board of Directors has adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which we currently pay a cash dividend on our common stock on a quarterlybasis. The declaration and payment of any dividend is subject to the approval of our Board of Directors and our dividend may be discontinued orreduced at any time. Because we are a holding company, our ability to pay cash dividends is also limited by restrictions or limitations on our ability toobtain sufficient funds through dividends from subsidiaries. In addition, any payment of dividends on our common stock is subject to and conditionedupon our payment of quarterly dividends on our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. There can be no assurance that we will declare cashdividends in the future in any particular amounts, or at all.ITEM 1B.UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.ITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with “SelectedFinancial Data” and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Thisdiscussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results maydiffer materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under the caption“Risk Factors” or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.OverviewWe are a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions.We develop semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices andanalog III-V based products. We have a history of innovation in the semiconductor industry and offer thousands of products that are used in endproducts such as enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, set-top boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment,smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, andelectronic displays. Our infrastructure software solutions enable customers to plan, develop, automate, manage and secure applications acrossmainframe, distributed, mobile and cloud platforms. We offer a cyber security solutions portfolio, including endpoint, network, information and identitysecurity solutions. We also offer mission critical fibre channel storage area networking (“FC SAN”) products and related software in the form ofmodules, switches and subsystems incorporating multiple semiconductor products.During the first quarter of our fiscal year ended November 1, 2020 (“fiscal year 2020”), we changed our organizational structure, resulting in tworeportable segments: semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. In addition, during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2020, we refinedour allocation methodology for certain selling, general and administrative expenses to more closely align these costs with the segment benefitingfrom the shared expenses. Prior period segment results have been recast to conform to the current presentation.Our strategy is to combine best-of-breed technology leadership in semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions, with unmatched scale,on a common sales and administrative platform to deliver a comprehensive suite of infrastructure technology products to the world’s leading businessand government customers. We seek to achieve this through responsibly financed acquisitions of category-leading businesses and technologies, aswell as investing extensively in research and development, to ensure our products retain their technology leadership. This strategy results in a robustbusiness model designed to drive diversified and sustainable operating and financial results.The demand for our products has been affected in the past, and is likely to continue to be affected in the future, by various factors, including thefollowing:•gain or loss of significant customers;•general economic and market conditions in the industries and markets in which we compete;•our distributors’ product inventory and end customer demand;•the rate at which our present and future customers and end-users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets, and the rate atwhich our customers' products that include our technology are accepted in their markets; •the shift to cloud-based IT solutions and services, such as hyperscale computing, which may adversely affect the timing and volume of salesof our products for use in traditional enterprise data centers; and•the timing, rescheduling or cancellation of expected customer orders.Our fiscal year 2020 and our fiscal year ended November 3, 2019 (“fiscal year 2019”) were 52-week fiscal years compared to our fiscal yearended November 4, 2018 (“fiscal year 2018”), which was a 53-week fiscal year.COVID-19 UpdateIn response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the various resulting government directives, we have taken extensive measures to protectthe health and safety of our employees and contractors at our facilities. We modified our workplace practices globally, which resulted in most of ouremployees working remotely for an extended periods of time. While we have implemented a phased-in return of employees to many of our facilities,if the spread of COVID-19 worsens significantly, we may need to further limit onsite operations or otherwise modify our business practices. Wecontinue to monitor the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, as well as our customers’ and suppliers’ businesses.36Table of ContentsThe demand environment for our semiconductor products was consistent with our expectations for our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, withcontinued demand for products and infrastructure to support a dramatic increase around the world in remote or tele-work and learning due to COVID-19. While we continue to see robust demand in this area, the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and it may not be sustainable over thelonger term. To date, the impact of COVID-19 on the demand environment for our software products has been limited. On the product supply side,we continue to experience various constraints in our supply chain due to the pandemic, including with respect to wafers and substrates. As a result,supply lead times are still extended and we continue to have difficulties in obtaining some necessary components and inputs in a timely manner.However, the disruptions in our outsourced assembly and test capacity that we experienced previously, as a result of COVID-19 related shutdowns,have now largely resolved.We have also taken various actions to de-risk our business in light of the ongoing uncertainty. For example, we are largely buildingsemiconductor products to order, instead of based on customer forecasts. In addition, during the fourth fiscal quarter, we continued to strengthen ourbalance sheet, including closely managing working capital and reducing our total debt outstanding.Overall, in light of the changing nature and continuing uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to predict the impact of COVID-19on our business in future periods remains limited. The effects of the pandemic on our business are unlikely to be fully realized, or reflected in ourfinancial results, until future periods.Fiscal Year HighlightsHighlights during fiscal year 2020 include the following:•We acquired the Symantec Corporation Enterprise Security business (the “Symantec Business”).•We generated $12,061 million of cash from operations.•We paid $5,534 million in cash dividends.Acquisitions and DivestituresThe discussion and analysis in this section and the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations ofacquired companies commencing on their respective acquisition dates.Acquisition of Symantec Corporation’s Enterprise Security BusinessOn November 4, 2019, we completed the purchase and assumption of certain assets and certain liabilities, respectively, of the SymantecBusiness for $10.7 billion in cash (the “Symantec Asset Purchase”). We financed this acquisition with the net proceeds from the borrowings under theNovember 2019 Term Loans, as defined in Note 10. “Borrowings” included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Acquisition of CA, Inc.On November 5, 2018, we acquired CA, Inc. (“CA”) for $18.8 billion in aggregate cash purchase consideration and assumed $2.25 billion ofoutstanding unsecured bonds (the “CA Merger”). We financed the CA Merger with $18 billion of term loans, as well as cash on hand of the combinedcompanies. We also assumed all eligible unvested CA equity awards in the transaction. On December 31, 2018, we sold Veracode, Inc.(“Veracode”), a subsidiary of CA and provider of application security testing solutions, to Thoma Bravo, LLC for cash consideration of $950 million,before working capital adjustments.Acquisition of Brocade Communications Systems, Inc.On November 17, 2017, we acquired Brocade Communications Systems, Inc. (“Brocade”) for $6.0 billion in cash, including retirement of theirterm loan debt, which we financed using the net proceeds from the issuance of our senior unsecured notes, issued in October 2017, as well as cashon hand. We also assumed all eligible unvested Brocade equity awards in the transaction. On December 1, 2017, we sold certain Brocade businessfor an aggregate of $800 million in cash.Net RevenueA majority of our net revenue is derived from sales of a broad range of semiconductor devices that are incorporated into electronic products, aswell as from modules, switches and subsystems. Net revenue is also generated from the sale of software solutions that enable our customers toplan, develop, automate, manage, and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, mobile, and cloud platforms.Our overall net revenue, as well as the percentage of total net revenue generated by sales in our semiconductor solutions and infrastructuresoftware segments, has varied from quarter to quarter, due largely to fluctuations in end-market demand, including the effects of seasonality, whichare discussed in detail in Part I, Item 1. Business under “Seasonality” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.37Table of ContentsOriginal equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), or their contract manufacturers, and distributors typically account for the substantial majority of oursemiconductor sales. To serve customers around the world, we have strategically developed relationships with large global electronic componentdistributors, complemented by a number of regional distributors with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges. We also sellour products to a wide variety of OEMs or their contract manufacturers. We have established strong relationships with leading OEM customersacross multiple target markets. Our direct sales force focuses on supporting our large OEM customers and has specialized product and serviceknowledge that enables us to sell specific offerings at key levels throughout a customer’s organization. Certain customers require us to contract withthem directly and with specified intermediaries, such as contract manufacturers. Many of our major customer relationships have been in place formany years and are often the result of years of collaborative product development. This has enabled us to build our extensive intellectual property(“IP”) portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our customers’ requirements, including substantial system-level knowledge. This collaborationhas provided us with key insights into our customers' businesses and has enabled us to be more efficient and productive and to better serve ourtarget markets and customers. We recognize revenue upon delivery of product to the distributors, which can cause our quarterly net revenue tofluctuate significantly. Such revenue is reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances.Our traditional software customers generally consist of large enterprises that have computing environments from multiple vendors and arehighly complex. We believe our enterprise-wide license model will continue to offer our customers reduced complexity, more flexibility and an easierrenewal process that will help drive revenue growth.Costs and ExpensesCost of products sold.  Cost of products sold consists primarily of the costs for semiconductor wafers and other materials, as well as the costs ofassembling and testing those products and materials. Such costs include personnel and overhead related to our manufacturing operations, whichinclude stock-based compensation expense; related occupancy; computer services; equipment costs; manufacturing quality; order fulfillment;warranty adjustments; inventory adjustments, including write-downs for inventory obsolescence; and acquisition costs, which include directtransaction costs and acquisition-related costs.Although we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities, we do have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities. Ifwe are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a desired level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed,resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins.Cost of subscriptions and services. Cost of subscriptions and services consists of personnel, project costs associated with professional servicesor support of our subscriptions and services revenue, and allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses. Personnel costs include stock-based compensation expense.Total cost of revenue also includes the purchase accounting effect on inventory, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets andrestructuring charges.Research and development.  Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the designand development of our products and technologies, including stock-based compensation expense. These expenses also include project materialcosts, third-party fees paid to consultants, prototype development expense, allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses and computerservices costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process.Selling, general and administrative.  Selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketingpersonnel, including stock-based compensation expense, sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives, advertising costs, tradeshows, corporate marketing, promotion, travel related to our sales and marketing operations, related occupancy and equipment costs, and othermarketing costs. General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance,human resources and other administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, outside professional fees, allocated facilitiescosts, acquisition-related costs and other corporate expenses.Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets.  In connection with our acquisitions, we recognize intangible assets that are beingamortized over their estimated useful lives. We also recognize goodwill, which is not amortized, and in-process research and development(“IPR&D”), which is initially capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, in connection with the acquisitions. Upon completion of each underlyingproject, IPR&D assets are reclassified as amortizable purchased intangible assets and amortized over their estimated useful lives.Restructuring, impairment and disposal charges. Restructuring, impairment and disposal charges consist primarily of compensation costsassociated with employee exit programs, alignment of our global manufacturing operations, rationalizing product development program costs, facilityand lease abandonments, fixed asset impairment, IPR&D impairment, and other exit costs, including curtailment of service or supply agreements.38Table of ContentsInterest expense.  Interest expense includes coupon interest, commitment fees, accretion of original issue discount, amortization of debtpremiums and debt issuance costs, and expenses related to debt modifications or extinguishments.Other income, net.  Other income, net includes interest income, gains or losses on investments, foreign currency remeasurement, and othermiscellaneous items.Provision for (benefit from) income taxes.  We have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from tax incentives extended to us invarious jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. Our tax incentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board provide that anyqualifying income earned in Singapore is subject to tax incentives or reduced rates of Singapore income tax. Subject to our compliance with theconditions specified in these incentives and legislative developments, these Singapore tax incentives are presently expected to expire in November2025. The corporate income tax rate in Singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 17%. We also have a tax holiday on our qualifyingincome in Malaysia, which is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2028.Each tax incentive and tax holiday is also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions. If we cannot, or elect not to,comply with any such operating conditions specified, we could, in some instances, be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits, or ifsuch tax incentive or tax holiday is terminated prior to its expiration absent a new incentive applying, we will lose the related tax benefits earlier thanscheduled. We may elect to modify our operational structure and tax strategy, which may not be as beneficial to us as the benefits provided under thepresent tax concession arrangements. Before taking into consideration the effects of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“2017 Tax Reform Act”) andother indirect tax impacts, the effect of these tax incentives and tax holiday was to increase the benefit from income taxes by approximately $833million, $923 million and $590 million for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority, and if our assumptions about tax andother laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financialconsequences, which would increase our expenses, reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows. In addition, taxable income in anyjurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm’slength basis. Due to inconsistencies in application of the arm’s length standard among taxing authorities, as well as lack of adequate treaty-basedprotection, transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could, if successful, substantially increase our income tax expense.The 2017 Tax Reform Act made significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, including (1) a decrease in the U.S. corporate tax ratefrom 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, (2) the accrual of U.S. income tax on foreign earnings when earned,allowing certain foreign dividends to then be tax-exempt, rather than deferring such income tax payments until the foreign earnings are repatriatedinto the U.S., and (3) the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated non-U.S. earnings of U.S. controlled foreigncorporations (the “Transition Tax”). Following the enactment of the 2017 Tax Reform Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), issuedguidance for situations when there is insufficient information to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the 2017 Tax Reform Act.Based on our interpretation of the 2017 Tax Reform Act and the SEC’s guidance, we recognized an income tax benefit of $7,278 million during fiscalyear 2018. During fiscal year 2019 we recorded an income tax provision of $113 million from a change in estimate of our fiscal year 2018 benefit as aresult of proposed U.S. Treasury regulations issued in fiscal year 2019 related to the 2017 Tax Reform Act. We also recognized an income tax benefitof $1,162 million in fiscal year 2018 primarily as a result of our redomiciliation to the United States in April 2018.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) requires usto make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at thedate of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates andassumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results ofwhich form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are notreadily apparent from other sources. Our actual financial results may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. Our critical accountingpolicies are those that affect our historical financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management.Those policies include revenue recognition, business combinations, valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill, inventoryvaluation, income taxes, retirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions, stock-based compensation and employee bonus programs. SeeNote 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” included in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on ourcritical accounting policies and estimates.Revenue recognition.  We account for a contract with a customer when both parties have approved the contract and are committed to performtheir respective obligations, each party’s rights can be identified, payment terms can be identified, the39Table of Contentscontract has commercial substance, and it is probable we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to. Revenue is recognizedwhen, or as, performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer. Our products and servicescan be broadly categorized as sales of products and subscriptions and services.We recognize products revenue from sales to direct customers and distributors when control transfers to the customer. An allowance fordistributor credits covering price adjustments is made based on our estimate of historical experience rates as well as considering economicconditions and contractual terms. To date, actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made basedon our historical estimates. However, because of the inherent nature of estimates, there is always a risk that there could be significant differencesbetween actual amounts and our estimates. Different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to reported operatingresults. We also record reductions of revenue for rebates in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. We accrue 100% of potentialrebates at the time of sale. We reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end and when we believeunclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid. Thus, the reversal of unclaimed rebates may have a positive impact on ournet revenue and net income in subsequent periods.Our contracts may contain more than one of our products and services, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinct performanceobligation. When available, we use directly observable transactions to determine the standalone selling prices for performance obligations. Ourestimates of standalone selling price for each performance obligation require judgment that considers multiple factors, including, but not limited to,historical discounting trends for products and services and pricing practices through different sales channels, gross margin objectives, internal costs,competitor pricing strategies, technology lifecycles and market conditions.We also estimate the standalone selling price of our material rights. Our estimate of the value of the customer’s option to purchase or receiveadditional products or services at a discounted price includes estimating the incremental discount the customer would obtain when exercising theoption and the likelihood that the option would be exercised.Certain contracts contain a right of return that allows the customer to cancel all or a portion of the product or service and receive a credit. Weestimate returns based on historical returns data which is constrained to an amount for which a material revenue reversal is not probable. We do notrecognize revenue for products or services that are expected to be returned.Business combinations. Accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especiallyat the acquisition date, for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies, and contingentconsideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable andappropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and areinherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include, but are not limited to, future expectedcash flows from product sales, customer contracts and acquired technologies, revenue growth rate, customer ramp-up period, technologyobsolescence rates, expected costs to develop IPR&D into commercially viable products, estimated cash flows from the projects when completed,and discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expected future cash flows to present value are typically derived from a weighted-averagecost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect inherent risks. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that could affect either the accuracyor validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.Valuation of goodwill and long-lived assets.  We perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarter of eachyear, and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highlysubjective and requires significant judgment. To review for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events orcircumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount.Our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, whether performed annually or based on specific events or circumstances, considersvarious macroeconomic, industry-specific and company-specific factors. These factors include: (i) severe adverse industry or economic trends;(ii) significant company-specific actions, including exiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operations; (iii) current, historical or projecteddeterioration of our financial performance; or (iv) a sustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value. After assessing thetotality of events and circumstances, if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than itscarrying amount, no further assessment is performed. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units isless than its carrying amount, we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit’s net book value.Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Our goodwill impairment test uses boththe income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. The40Table of Contentsincome approach is based on the discounted cash flow method that uses the reporting unit estimates for forecasted future financial performanceincluding revenues, operating expenses, and taxes, as well as working capital and capital asset requirements. These estimates are developed aspart of our long-term planning process based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share, estimated costsbased on historical data and various internal estimates. Projected cash flows are then discounted to a present value employing a discount rate thatproperly accounts for the estimated market weighted-average cost of capital, as well as any risk unique to the subject cash flows. The marketapproach is based on weighting financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium. A reporting unit's carrying valuerepresents the assignment of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash and debt.We assess the impairment of long-lived assets including purchased IPR&D, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets, wheneverevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important whichcould trigger an impairment review include (i) significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, (ii) significantchanges in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, or (iii) significant negative industry or economictrends. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of long-lived assets under the accounting guidance on property, plant and equipment andother intangible assets is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment. In order to estimate the fair value of long-lived assets, we typicallymake various assumptions about the future prospects of our business or the part of our business that the long-lived asset relates to. We alsoconsider market factors specific to the business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by the business, which requires significant judgmentas it is based on assumptions about market demand for our products over a number of future years. Based on these assumptions and estimates, wedetermine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the long-lived asset stated on our consolidated balance sheets toreflect its estimated fair value. Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They canbe affected by a variety of factors, including external factors, such as the real estate market, industry and economic trends, and internal factors, suchas changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past havebeen reasonable and appropriate, changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results.Inventory valuation.  We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarilyon our forecast of product demand and production requirements. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Asignificant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand. In addition, our industry ischaracterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase inthe amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand. Additionally, our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate, which maycause us to understate or overstate both the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory and cost of products sold. Therefore, although wemake every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand ortechnological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations.Income taxes. Significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for or benefit from income taxes, including thedetermination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets. We haveconsidered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances.If we determine that a valuation allowance is required, such adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase our tax expense in the period inwhich such determination is made. Conversely, if we determine that a valuation allowance exceeds our requirement, such adjustment to the deferredtax assets would decrease tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. In evaluating the exposure associated with various taxfiling positions, we accrue an income tax liability when such positions do not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition.The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude ofjurisdictions. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether,and the extent to which, additional taxes, interest, and penalties will be due. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the actualamount ultimately assessed, a further charge to tax expense would be required. If the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to beunnecessary, the reversal of the accrued liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities nolonger exist.41Table of ContentsRetirement and post-retirement benefit plan assumptions.  Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs represent obligations that willultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore, are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of futureretirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs over the employees' average expected future service to us, based on the terms of the plans andinvestment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we arerequired to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of GAAP. One assumption is the discount rate used to calculate theestimated costs. Other assumptions include the expected long-term return on plan assets, expected future salary increases, the health care costtrend rate, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfoliocomposition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually.For our U.S. and non-U.S. plans, we use October 31, the month end closest to our fiscal year end, as the annual discount rate measurementdate to determine the present value of future benefit payments. The U.S. discount rates are based on the results of matching expected plan benefitpayments with cash flows from a hypothetical yield curve constructed with high-quality corporate bond yields. The discount rate for non-U.S. planswas based either on published rates for government bonds or use of a hypothetical yield curve constructed with high-quality corporate bond yields,depending on the availability of sufficient quantities of quality corporate bonds. Lower discount rates increase present values of the pension liabilitiesand subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates decrease present values of the pension liabilities and subsequent year pensionexpense.The U. S. expected rate of return on plan assets is set equal to the discount rate due to the implementation of our fully-matched, liability-driveninvestment strategy.Actuarial assumptions are based on our best estimates and judgment. Material changes may occur in retirement benefit costs in the future ifthese assumptions differ from actual events or experiences. We performed a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate, which is the key assumption incalculating the U.S. pension and post-retirement benefit obligations. Each change of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption would have hadan estimated $40 million impact on the benefit obligations as of the fiscal year 2020 measurement date. Each change of 25 basis points in thediscount rate assumption or expected rate of return assumption would not have a material impact on annual net retirement benefit costs for the fiscalyear ending October 31, 2021 (“fiscal year 2021”).Stock-based compensation expense.  Stock-based compensation expense consists of expense for restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and stockoptions granted to employees and non-employees or assumed from acquisitions as well as expense associated with Broadcom employee stockpurchase plan (“ESPP”). We recognize compensation expense for time-based stock options and ESPP rights based on the estimated grant-date fairvalue method required under the authoritative guidance using the Black-Scholes valuation model.Certain equity awards include both time-based and market-based conditions and are accounted for as market-based awards. The fair value ofthese market-based awards is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model.Employee Bonus Programs. Our employee bonus programs, which are overseen by our Compensation Committee, or our Board, in the case ofour Chief Executive Officer, provide for variable compensation based on the attainment of overall corporate annual targets and functionalperformance metrics. In the first fiscal quarter of the year, if management determines that it is probable that the targets and metrics will be achievedand the amounts can be reasonably estimated, a variable, proportional compensation accrual is recognized based on an assumed 100%achievement of the targets and metrics. The bonus payout levels can be greater if attainment of metrics and targets is greater than 100% and aportion of the payouts may not occur if a minimum floor of performance is not achieved. In subsequent quarters, we monitor and accrue for variablecompensation expense based on our actual progress toward the achievement of the annual targets and metrics. The actual achievement of targetmetrics at the end of the fiscal year, which is subject to approval by our Compensation Committee, may result in the actual variable compensationamounts being significantly higher or lower than the relevant estimated amounts accrued in earlier quarters, which would result in a correspondingadjustment in the fourth fiscal quarter.Fiscal Year PresentationWe operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to October 31 in a 52-week year and the first Sunday in November ina 53-week year. Our fiscal years 2020 and 2019 consisted of 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2018 consisted of 53 weeks.The financial statements included in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented in accordance with GAAP and expressedin U.S. dollars.42Table of ContentsResults of OperationsFiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2019The following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented: Fiscal Year EndedNovember 1,2020November 3,2019November 1,2020November 3,2019 (In millions)(As a percentage of net revenue)Statements of Operations Data:    Net revenue:Products$17,435 $18,117 73 %80 %Subscriptions and services6,453 4,480 27 20 Total net revenue23,888 22,597 100 100 Cost of revenue:Cost of products sold5,892 6,208 25 28 Cost of subscriptions and services626 515 2 2 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets3,819 3,314 16 15 Restructuring charges35 77 — — Total cost of revenue10,372 10,114 43 45 Gross margin13,516 12,483 57 55 Research and development4,968 4,696 21 21 Selling, general and administrative1,935 1,709 8 8 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets2,401 1,898 10 8 Restructuring, impairment and disposal charges198 736 1 3 Total operating expenses9,502 9,039 40 40 Operating income$4,014 $3,444 17 %15 %Net RevenueHistorically, a relatively small number of customers has accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue. Sales of products to distributorsaccounted for 42% and 46% of our net revenue for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Direct sales to WT Microelectronics, a distributor,accounted for 13% and 17% of our net revenue for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. We believe our aggregate sales to our top five endcustomers through all channels accounted for more than 30% of our net revenue for each of our fiscal years 2020 and 2019. We believe aggregatesales to Apple Inc., through all channels, accounted for approximately 15% and 20% of our net revenue for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.We expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods. The loss of, or significant decrease in demand from, any ofour top five end customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.From time to time, some of our key semiconductor customers place large orders or delay orders, causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuatesignificantly. This is particularly true of our wireless products as fluctuations may be magnified by the timing of launches, and seasonal variations insales, of mobile handsets. In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related challenges and uncertainties may also cause our net revenue tofluctuate significantly and adversely affect our results of operations, as discussed above. Additionally, if export restrictions on one of our largercustomers continue, revenue in future periods may continue to be adversely impacted.Although we recognize revenue for the majority of our products when title and control transfer in Penang, Malaysia, we disclose net revenue bycountry based on the geographic shipment or delivery location specified by distributors, OEMs, contract manufacturers, channel partners, or softwarecustomers. In each of fiscal years 2020 and 2019, approximately 35% of our net revenue came from shipments or deliveries to China (includingHong Kong), compared to approximately 50% for fiscal year 2018. However, the end customers for either our products or for the end products intowhich our products are incorporated, are frequently located in countries other than China (including Hong Kong). As a result, we believe that asubstantially smaller percentage of our net revenue is ultimately dependent on sales of either our product or our customers’ product incorporating ourproduct, to end customers located in China (including Hong Kong).43Table of ContentsThe following tables set forth net revenue by segment for the periods presented:Fiscal Year EndedNet Revenue by SegmentNovember 1,2020November 3,2019$ Change% Change(In millions, except for percentages)Semiconductor solutions$17,267 $17,441 $(174)(1)%Infrastructure software6,621 5,156 1,465 28 %Total net revenue$23,888 $22,597 $1,291 6 %Fiscal Year EndedNet Revenue by SegmentNovember 1, 2020November 3, 2019(As a percentage of net revenue)Semiconductor solutions72 %77 %Infrastructure software28 23 Total net revenue100 %100 %Our total net revenue increased primarily due to contributions from the Symantec enterprise security solutions in fiscal year 2020 compared tothe prior fiscal year. Net revenue from our semiconductor solutions segment decreased primarily due to delays in the production ramp of a newmobile handset by a major customer that resulted in lower than expected shipments in the year, partially offset by higher demand for our networkingand storage products. Net revenue from our infrastructure software segment increased primarily due to contributions from our Symantec enterprisesecurity solutions.Gross MarginGross margin was $13,516 million, or 57% of net revenue, for fiscal year 2020, compared to $12,483 million, or 55% of our net revenue, forfiscal year 2019. The increase was primarily due to contributions from our Symantec enterprise security solutions, as well as favorable product mixwithin our semiconductor solutions segment, compared to the corresponding prior fiscal year.Research and Development ExpenseResearch and development expense increased $272 million, or 6%, in fiscal year 2020, compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase wasprimarily due to our acquisition of the Symantec Business, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense resulting fromrestructuring actions.Selling, General and Administrative ExpenseSelling, general and administrative expense increased $226 million, or 13%, in fiscal year 2020, compared to the prior fiscal year. The increasewas primarily due to our acquisition of the Symantec Business and associated acquisition-related costs, partially offset by a decrease incompensation expense, including stock-based compensation, resulting from restructuring actions.Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible AssetsAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets recognized in operating expenses increased $503 million, or 27%, in fiscal year 2020,compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to the addition of amortization of intangible assets as a result of our acquisition ofthe Symantec Business.Restructuring, Impairment and Disposal ChargesRestructuring, impairment and disposal charges included in operating expenses decreased $538 million, or 73%, in fiscal year 2020, comparedto the prior fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to higher employee termination costs, as well as lease and other exit costs resulting from theCA Merger, in the prior fiscal year.44Table of ContentsSegment Operating ResultsFiscal Year EndedOperating Income (Loss)November 1, 2020November 3, 2019$ Change% Change(In millions, except for percentages)Semiconductor solutions$8,576 $8,538 $38 — %Infrastructure software4,363 3,391 972 29 %Unallocated expenses(8,925)(8,485)(440)5 %Total operating income$4,014 $3,444 $570 17 %Operating income from our semiconductor solutions segment increased slightly, primarily due to higher demand for storage products, largelyoffset by delays in the production ramp of a new mobile handset by a major customer, which resulted in lower than expected shipments in the year.Operating income from our infrastructure software segment increased primarily due to contributions from our Symantec enterprise security solutions.Unallocated expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; stock-based compensation expense; acquisition-relatedcosts; restructuring, impairment and disposal charges; and other costs that are not used in evaluating the results of, or in allocating resources to, oursegments. Unallocated expenses increased 5% in fiscal year 2020, compared to the prior year fiscal period, primarily due to higher amortization ofacquisition-related intangible assets and acquisition-related costs, partially offset by lower restructuring, impairment and disposal charges and stock-based compensation expense.Non-Operating Income and ExpensesInterest expense. Interest expense was $1,777 million and $1,444 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase wasprimarily due to the increase in debt associated with the financing of our acquisition of the Symantec Business, as well as losses on extinguishmentof debt related to refinancing activities during fiscal year 2020.Other income, net. Other income, net, which includes interest income, gains or losses on investments, foreign currency remeasurement andother miscellaneous items, was $206 million and $226 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to lowergains on investments, partially offset by a $116 million one-time gain from the lapse of a tax indemnification arrangement.Benefit from income taxes. Benefit from income taxes was $518 million and $510 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Thebenefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to the jurisdictional mix of income and expense, the recognition of gross uncertain taxbenefits as a result of lapses of statues of limitations, the remeasurement of certain foreign deferred tax assets and liabilities, and excess benefitfrom stock-based awards. The benefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock-based awards, therecognition of gross uncertain tax benefits as a result of audit settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations, deferred tax remeasurement in stateand foreign jurisdictions, internal reorganizations, and the partial release of our valuation allowance as a result of the CA Merger. This was partiallyoffset by a change in estimate of our fiscal year 2018 provision resulting from regulations issued related to the 2017 Tax Reform Act.45Table of ContentsFiscal Year 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year 2018The following table sets forth our results of operations for the periods presented:Fiscal Year EndedStatements of Operations Data:November 3, 2019November 4, 2018November 3, 2019November 4, 2018(In millions)(As a percentage of net revenue)Net revenue:Products$18,117 $19,754 80 %95 %Subscriptions and services4,480 1,094 20 5 Total net revenue22,597 20,848 100 100 Cost of revenue: Cost of products sold6,208 6,924 28 33 Cost of subscriptions and services515 97 2 1 Purchase accounting effect on inventory— 70 — — Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets3,314 3,004 15 14 Restructuring charges77 20 — — Total cost of revenue10,114 10,115 45 48 Gross margin12,483 10,733 55 52 Research and development4,696 3,768 21 18 Selling, general and administrative1,709 1,056 8 5 Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets1,898 541 8 3 Restructuring, impairment and disposal charges736 219 3 1 Litigation settlements— 14 — — Total operating expenses9,039 5,598 40 27 Operating income$3,444 $5,135 15 %25 %The following tables set forth net revenue by segment for the periods presented:Net RevenueFiscal Year EndedNet Revenue by SegmentNovember 3, 2019November 4, 2018$ Change% Change(In millions, except for percentages)Semiconductor solutions$17,441 $19,068 $(1,627)(9)%Infrastructure software5,156 1,780 3,376 190 %Total net revenue$22,597 $20,848 $1,749 8 %Fiscal Year EndedNet Revenue by SegmentNovember 3, 2019November 4, 2018(As a percentage of net revenue)Semiconductor solutions77 %92 %Infrastructure software23 8 Total net revenue100 %100 %Our total net revenue increased primarily due to the CA Merger in fiscal year 2019. Net revenue from our semiconductor solutions segmentdecreased due to lower demand for our wireless content in mobile handsets, as well as lower demand for our broadband, optocoupler, set-top boxand server storage connectivity products. Fiscal year 2018 semiconductor solutions revenue benefited from a later than typical new mobile handsetramp with a major customer in the first quarter, which resulted in higher shipments in that quarter, as well as an extra week in the fiscal year ascompared to fiscal year 2019. Net46Table of Contentsrevenue from our infrastructure software segment increased primarily due to contributions from our mainframe and enterprise software solutions.Gross MarginGross margin was $12,483 million, or 55% of net revenue, for fiscal year 2019 compared to $10,733 million, or 52% of net revenue, for fiscalyear 2018. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to contributions from our mainframe and enterprise software solutions and favorableproduct mix within our semiconductor solutions segment, compared to the prior fiscal year, partially offset by higher amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and restructuring charges as a result of the CA Merger and higher stock-based compensation expense.Research and Development ExpenseResearch and development expense increased $928 million, or 25%, in fiscal year 2019, compared to the prior fiscal year. Research anddevelopment expense as a percentage of net revenue was 21% and 18% for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase was primarilydue to the CA Merger and higher stock-based compensation expense, offset by lower variable employee compensation expense. Stock-basedcompensation expense increased primarily due to the issuance of the multi-year equity grants of time- and market-based RSUs (the “Multi-YearEquity Awards”) in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, the impact of the change from annual to quarterly vesting of equity awards and the assumedCA equity awards. Our stock-based compensation expense for fiscal year 2019 included employee equity awards granted at higher grant-date fairvalues than those granted in prior years, which also contributed to the increase.Selling, General and Administrative ExpenseSelling, general and administrative expense increased $653 million, or 62%, in fiscal year 2019, compared to the prior fiscal year. Selling,general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue was 8% and 5% for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase wasprimarily due to the CA Merger and higher stock-based compensation expense. Stock-based compensation expense increased primarily due to theissuance of the Multi-Year Equity Awards, the impact of the change from annual to quarterly vesting of equity awards and the assumed CA equityawards.Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangible AssetsAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets recognized in operating expenses increased $1,357 million, or 251%, in fiscal year 2019,compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to the addition of amortization of intangible assets acquired in the CA Merger.Restructuring, Impairment and Disposal ChargesRestructuring, impairment and disposal charges included in operating expenses increased $517 million, or 236%, in fiscal year 2019, comparedto the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to employee termination costs, as well as lease and other exit costs resulting from the CAMerger.Segment Operating ResultsFiscal Year EndedOperating Income by SegmentNovember 3, 2019November 4, 2018$ Change% Change(In millions, except for percentages)Semiconductor solutions$8,538 $9,253 $(715)(8)%Infrastructure software3,391 1,157 2,234 193 %Unallocated expenses(8,485)(5,275)(3,210)61 %Total operating income$3,444 $5,135 $(1,691)(33)%Operating income from our semiconductor solutions segment decreased primarily due to lower demand for our wireless content in mobilehandsets, as well as lower demand for our optocoupler, broadband, server storage connectivity and set-top box products.

Unallocated expenses increased 61% in fiscal year 2019, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to higher amortization ofacquisition-related intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, and restructuring, impairment and disposal charges primarily related to theCA Merger.Non-Operating Income and ExpensesInterest expense. Interest expense was $1,444 million and $628 million for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Interest expense washigher in fiscal year 2019 primarily due to interest on the debt we incurred to finance the CA Merger in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.Other income, net. Other income, net was $226 million and $144 million in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase was primarilydue to an increase in unrealized gains on investments partially offset by losses on foreign currency remeasurement.Benefit from income taxes. Benefit from income taxes was $510 million and $8,084 million for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Thebenefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to excess benefit from stock-based awards, the recognition of gross unrecognized taxbenefits as a result of audit settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations net of increases in balances related to tax positions taken during thecurrent year, benefit from deferred tax measurement in state and foreign jurisdictions, benefit related to internal reorganizations, and benefit from thepartial release of our valuation allowance as a result of the CA Merger, partially offset from a change in estimate of our fiscal year 2018 provisionresulting from regulations issued related to the 2017 Tax Reform Act. The benefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to incometax benefits recognized from the enactment of the 2017 Tax Reform Act and as a result of our redomiciliation to the United States on April 4, 2018.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe following section discusses our principal liquidity and capital resources as well as our primary liquidity requirements and uses of cash. Ourcash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. Webelieve our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible.Our primary sources of liquidity as of November 1, 2020 consisted of: (i) $7,618 million in cash and cash equivalents, (ii) cash we expect togenerate from operations and (iii) available capacity under our $5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”). In addition, wemay also generate cash from the sale of assets and debt or equity financing from time to time.Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from: (i) business acquisitions and investments we may make from time totime, (ii) working capital requirements, (iii) research and development and capital expenditure needs, (iv) cash dividend payments (if and whendeclared by our Board of Directors), (v) interest and principal payments related to our outstanding indebtedness and (vi) payment of income taxes.Our ability to fund these requirements will depend, in part, on our future cash flows, which are determined by our future operating performance and,therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows from operations, and the Revolving Facility will provide sufficient liquidity tooperate our business and fund our current and assumed obligations for at least the next 12 months. We expect a slight increase in capitalexpenditures in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020.From time to time, we engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions of, or investments in, businesses, technologiesand product lines. Any such transaction, or evaluation of potential transactions, could require significant use of our cash and cash equivalents, orrequire us to increase our borrowings to fund such transactions. If we do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations or finance growthopportunities, including acquisitions, or unanticipated capital expenditures, our business and financial condition could suffer. In such circumstances,we may seek to obtain new debt or equity financing. However, we cannot assure you that such additional financing will be available on termsacceptable to us or at all. Our ability to service our senior unsecured notes, outstanding term loans and any other indebtedness we may incur willdepend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We may also elect to sell additional debt or equity securities for reasons other than thosespecified above.In addition, we may, at any time and from time to time, seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash tenders and/or exchangesfor equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such tenders, exchanges or purchases, if any, will beupon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractualrestrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.48Working CapitalWorking capital increased to $5,524 million at November 1, 2020 from $3,018 million at November 3, 2019. The increase was attributable to thefollowing:•Cash and cash equivalents increased to $7,618 million at November 1, 2020 from $5,055 million at November 3, 2019, primarily due to$27,802 million in proceeds from long-term borrowings, $12,061 million in net cash provided by operating activities, and $218 million inproceeds from the sales of businesses, partially offset by $20,099 million of debt repayments, $10,700 million paid for the Symantec AssetPurchase, $5,534 million of dividend payments and $765 million in payments of employee withholding taxes related to net share settledequity awards. See the “Cash Flows” section below for further details.•Current portion of long-term debt decreased $1,960 million primarily due to repayment of certain debt, partially offset by additional amountscoming due within twelve months.•Other current assets increased to $977 million at November 1, 2020 from $729 million at November 3, 2019, primarily due to increases inprepaid taxes and short-term investments.•Inventory increased to $1,003 million at November 1, 2020 from $874 million at November 3, 2019, primarily due to timing of customerproduct ramps.These increases in working capital were offset in part by the following:•Other current liabilities increased to $3,831 million at November 1, 2020 from $2,616 million at November 3, 2019, primarily due to increasesin contract liabilities, interest payable, taxes payable, and lease liabilities resulting from the adoption of Accounting Standard CodificationTopic 842 (“Topic 842”), partially offset by repayments of notional pooling liabilities.•Accounts receivable decreased to $2,297 million at November 1, 2020 from $3,259 million at November 3, 2019, primarily due to revenuelinearity and additional receivables sold through factoring arrangements.•Employee compensation and benefits increased to $877 million at November 1, 2020 from $641 million at November 3, 2019, primarily dueto the employee bonus plan.Working capital decreased to $3,018 million at November 3, 2019 from $6,769 million at November 4, 2018. The decrease was attributable tothe following:•Accounts receivable decreased to $3,259 million at November 3, 2019 from $3,325 million at November 4, 2018, primarily due to a highervolume of trade accounts receivable factoring, partially offset by higher revenue.•Inventory decreased to $874 million at November 3, 2019 from $1,124 million at November 4, 2018, primarily due to our continued focus oninventory management.•Current portion of long-term debt increased $2,787 million primarily due to certain unsecured senior notes becoming due within the nexttwelve months.•Other current liabilities increased to $2,616 million at November 3, 2019 from $812 million at November 4, 2018, primarily due to the CAMerger and increases in contract liabilities from the adoption of Topic 606, notional pooling liabilities, restructuring reserves, taxes payableand interest payable.These decreases in working capital were offset in part by the following:•Cash and cash equivalents increased to $5,055 million at November 3, 2019 from $4,292 million at November 4, 2018 primarily due to$30,034 million in proceeds from long-term borrowings, $9,697 million in net cash provided by operating activities, $3,679 million ofMandatory Convertible Preferred Stock issuance proceeds and $957 million in proceeds from sale of Veracode, partially offset by $16,800million of debt repayments, $16,027 million paid for the CA Merger, $5,435 million of common stock repurchases, $4,235 million of dividendpayments, and $972 million in payments of employee withholding taxes related to net share settled equity awards. See the “Cash Flows”section below for further details.•Other current assets increased to $729 million at November 3, 2019 from $366 million at November 4, 2018, primarily due to assets acquiredin the CA Merger and increases in contract assets from adoption of Topic 606 and prepaid taxes.49Capital Returns Fiscal Year EndedCash Dividends and Distributions Declared and PaidNovember 1, 2020November 3, 2019November 4, 2018(In millions, except per share/unit data)Dividends per share to common stockholders$13.00 $10.60 $7.00 Dividends to common stockholders$5,235 $4,235 $2,921 Dividends per share to preferred stockholders$80.00 $— $— Dividends to preferred stockholders$299 $— $— Distributions per unit to limited partners$— $— $3.50 Distributions to limited partners$— $— $77 Stock repurchases$— $5,435 $7,258 During fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, we paid approximately $765 million, $972 million and $56 million, respectively, in employeewithholding taxes due upon the vesting of net settled equity awards. We withheld approximately 3 million, 4 million and 0.2 million shares of commonstock from employees in connection with such net share settlements in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Pursuant to an $18 billion stock repurchase program previously authorized by our Board of Directors, we repurchased and retired approximately21 million and 32 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of $258.52 and $227.60 during fiscal years 2019 and 2018,respectively.

The $2,364 million increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was due to higher cashflows from net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in the operating assets and liabilities.The $817 million increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to changes inoperating assets and liabilities. Cash flows from net income adjusted for non-cash items were relatively flat as higher net income in fiscal year 2018reflected a significant non-cash income tax benefit, principally resulting from the enactment of the 2017 Tax Reform Act and the impact from ourredomiciliation to the United States in fiscal year 2018.Investing ActivitiesCash flows from investing activities primarily consisted of cash used for acquisitions, capital expenditures and investments, and proceeds fromsales of businesses and assets. The $4,313 million decrease in cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019was primarily related to a $5,161 million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions, partially offset by $739 million less in proceeds received from sales ofbusinesses.The $10,748 million increase in cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily related to$16,027 million paid for the CA Merger in fiscal year 2019, partially offset by proceeds from sales of businesses as well as lower capitalexpenditures.50Financing ActivitiesCash flows from financing activities primarily consisted of net proceeds and payments related to our long-term borrowings, dividend anddistribution payments, stock repurchases and the issuances of stock. The $4,877 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities for fiscalyear 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a $5,531 million decrease in net proceeds from borrowings as a result of debtrepayments, the absence of preferred stock issuance which generated $3,679 million net proceeds in fiscal year 2019 and a $1,299 million increasein dividend payments, partially offset by the absence of repurchases of common stock under our repurchase program, which ended in fiscal year2019, as compared to $5,435 million of repurchases in fiscal year 2019.The $17,606 million increase in cash related to financing activities for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to a$14,207 million increase in net proceeds from borrowings, net proceeds of $3,679 million from issuance of preferred stock and a $1,823 milliondecrease in common stock repurchases under our repurchase program, partially offset by a $1,237 million increase in dividend and distributionpayments and a $916 million increase in employee withholding tax payments related to net settled equity awards.IndebtednessSee Note 10. “Borrowings” included in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Summarized Obligor Group Financial InformationPursuant to the indentures dated May 21, 2020, May 8, 2020, April 9, 2020, and April 5, 2019 (collectively, the “2020 and 2019 Indentures”),Broadcom issued $3,917 million, $8,000 million, $4,500 million, and $11,000 million aggregate principal amount of notes, respectively (collectively,the “2020 and 2019 Senior Notes”).

Represents unconditional purchase obligations that include agreements to purchase goods or services, primarilyinventory, that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased,fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that arecancelable without penalty.

Therefore, $3,185 million of unrecognizedtax benefits and accrued interest classified within other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of November 1, 2020 have beenexcluded from the contractual obligations table above.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe had no material off-balance sheet arrangements at November 1, 2020 as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K under the ExchangeAct.IndemnificationsSee Note 14. “Commitments and Contingencies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.Accounting Changes and Recent Accounting StandardsFor a description of accounting changes and recent accounting standards, including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects, ifany, in our consolidated financial statements, see Note 2. “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” included in Part II, Item 8. of this AnnualReport on Form 10-K.ITEM 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKForeign Currency Derivative InstrumentsFrom time to time, we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposures to changes in currency exchange rates,which result from our global operating and financing activities. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, as well as derivative instruments,were not significant for any period presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. As of November 1, 2020, we did nothave any outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts.European Debt ExposuresWe actively monitor our exposure to the European financial markets, including the impact of sovereign debt issues. We also seek to mitigate ourrisk by investing in fixed deposits with various financial institutions and we limit the amount we hold53Table of Contentswith any one institution. We do not have any direct investments in the sovereign debt of European countries. From time to time, we may havedeposits with major European financial institutions. We also seek to mitigate collection risks from our customers by performing regular creditevaluations of our customers’ financial condition. As of November 1, 2020, we do not believe that we have any material direct or indirect exposure tothe European financial markets.Interest Rate RiskAs of November 1, 2020, we had $5.9 billion of outstanding term loans, which are subject to floating interest rates. A 1% change in the interestrate would affect interest expense on our term loans by approximately $59 million over the next 12 months.54Table of ContentsITEM 8.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financialreporting as of November 1, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee ofSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company asof November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period endedNovember 1, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Companymaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 1, 2020, based on criteria established in InternalControl - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Change in Accounting PrincipleAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in fiscal 2020.Basis for OpinionsThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financialreporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal ControlOver Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements andon the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public CompanyAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtainreasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, andwhether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidatedfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, ona test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating theaccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidatedfinancial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financialreporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal controlbased on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. Webelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financialreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’sinternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions arerecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receiptsandexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) providereasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that couldhave a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of anyevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or thatthe degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that wascommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to theconsolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical auditmatters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating thecritical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Valuation of Developed Technology and Customer Contracts and Related Relationships Intangible Assets Acquired - Symantec CorporationEnterprise Security BusinessAs described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the purchase of certain assets and assumption ofcertain liabilities of the Symantec Corporation Enterprise Security business on November 4, 2019 for $10.7 billion in cash, of which $2.9 billion offinite-lived developed technology and $2.4 billion of finite-lived customer contracts and related relationships intangible assets were recorded.Management valued the developed technology using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. This method reflects thepresent value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated by the developed technology less charges representing the contributionof other assets to those cash flows. Management valued the customer contracts and related relationships using the with-and-without-method underthe income approach. In this method, the fair value was measured by the difference between the present values of the cash flows with and withoutthe existing customers in place over the period of time necessary to reacquire the customers. Significant estimates and assumptions in estimatingthe fair value of the developed technology and the customer contracts and related relationships include future expected cash flows from productsales, customer contracts and acquired technologies, revenue growth rate, customer ramp-up period, technology obsolescence rates, and discountrates.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the developed technology and the customercontracts and related relationships intangible assets acquired in the Symantec Corporation Enterprise Security business acquisition is a critical auditmatter are (i) a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in performing procedures relating to the fair value measurement of the developedtechnology and the customer contracts and related relationships due to the significant judgment by management when developing these estimates,(ii) the significant audit effort in evaluating the significant assumptions relating to the valuation of the developed technology and the customercontracts and related relationships related to the revenue growth rate, the customer ramp-up period, the technology obsolescence rates, and thediscount rates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on theconsolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, includingcontrols over management’s valuation of the developed technology and the customer contracts and related relationships and controls overdevelopment of the assumptions related to the revenue growth rate, the customer ramp-up period, the technology obsolescence rates, and thediscount rates. These procedures also included, among others, reading the purchase agreement and testing management’s process for determiningthe fair value of these intangible assets, including evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods, testing the completeness and accuracy ofdata used in the methods, and evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions related to the revenue growth rate, the customer ramp-up period, the technology obsolescence rates, and the discount rates. Evaluating the reasonableness of the revenue growth rate and the customerramp-up period involved considering the past performance of the acquired business and industry data. Evaluating the reasonableness of thetechnology obsolescence rates involved considering the past performance of the acquired business and benchmarking of peer companies.Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of valuation methods and thereasonableness of the customer ramp-up period, the technology obsolescence rates, and the discount rates./s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaDecember 18, 2020We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2006.56Table of ContentsBROADCOM INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETSNovember

Overview and Basis of PresentationOverviewBroadcom Inc. (“Broadcom”), a Delaware corporation, is the successor to Broadcom Limited (now Broadcom Pte. Ltd.), a Singapore company(“Broadcom-Singapore”). On April 4, 2018, all Broadcom-Singapore outstanding ordinary shares were exchanged for newly issued shares ofBroadcom common stock (the “Redomiciliation Transaction”). As a result, Broadcom-Singapore became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Broadcom. Inaddition, all outstanding exchangeable limited partnership units (“LP Units”) of Broadcom Cayman L.P. (the “Partnership”) were mandatorilyexchanged (the “Mandatory Exchange”) for newly issued shares of Broadcom common stock and all limited partners of the Partnership becamecommon stockholders of Broadcom. Also, all related outstanding special preference shares of Broadcom-Singapore were automatically redeemedupon the Mandatory Exchange. The limited partners no longer hold a noncontrolling interest and we deregistered the Partnership.The Redomiciliation Transaction was accounted for as an exchange of equity interests among entities under common control and the historicalbasis of accounting was retained as if the entities had always been combined for financial reporting purposes.The financial statements relate to Broadcom-Singapore for periods prior to April 4, 2018, the effective date of the Redomiciliation Transaction,and relate to Broadcom for periods after April 4, 2018. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to “Broadcom,” “we,”“our” and “us” mean Broadcom and its consolidated subsidiaries from and after the effective time of the Redomiciliation Transaction and, prior to thattime, to our predecessor, Broadcom-Singapore.We are a global technology leader that designs, develops and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions.We develop semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor based devices andanalog III-V based products. We have a history of innovation in the semiconductor industry and offer thousands of products that are used in endproducts such as enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, set-top boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment,smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, andelectronic displays. Our infrastructure software solutions enable customers to plan, develop, automate, manage and secure applications acrossmainframe, distributed, mobile and cloud platforms. We offer a cyber security solutions portfolio, including endpoint, network, information and identitysecurity solutions. We also offer mission critical fibre channel storage area networking (“FC SAN”) products and related software in the form ofmodules, switches and subsystems incorporating multiple semiconductor products.Basis of PresentationWe operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Sunday closest to October 31 in a 52-week year and the first Sunday in November ina 53-week year. Our fiscal year ended November 1, 2020 (“fiscal year 2020”) was a 52-week fiscal year. The first quarter of our fiscal year 2020ended on February 2, 2020, the second quarter ended on May 3, 2020 and the third quarter ended on August 2, 2020. Our fiscal year endedNovember 3, 2019 (“fiscal year 2019”) was a 52-week fiscal year. Our fiscal year ended November 4, 2018 (“fiscal year 2018”) was a 53-week fiscalyear, with the first fiscal quarter containing 14 weeks.On November 4, 2019, we completed the purchase of certain assets and assumption of certain liabilities of the Symantec CorporationEnterprise Security business (the “Symantec Business”). On November 5, 2018, we acquired CA, Inc. (“CA”). On November 17, 2017, we acquiredBrocade Communications Systems, Inc. (“Brocade”). The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations ofSymantec Business, CA and Brocade commencing as of their respective acquisition dates. See Note 4. “Acquisitions” for additional information.Certain reclassifications have been made to the consolidated statement of cash flows for fiscal year 2019. These reclassifications have noimpact on previously reported operating, investing or financing cash flows. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, we changed our organizationalstructure, resulting in two reportable segments: semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. Reclassifications have also been made tosegment operating income. Segment results from prior years have been recast to conform to the current presentation. See Note 13. “SegmentInformation” for additional information. These reclassifications have no impact on previously reported consolidated operating income.The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Broadcom and its subsidiaries and have been prepared inaccordance with generally accepted principles in the United States (“GAAP”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated inconsolidation.62Table of Contents2. Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesForeign currency remeasurement.  We operate in a U.S. dollar functional currency environment. As such, foreign currency assets and liabilitiesare remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates except for non-monetary items such as inventory and property, plant and equipment,which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. The effects of foreign currency remeasurement were not material for any period presented.Use of estimates.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptionsthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements andthe reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The inputs into certain of these estimates and assumptions include theconsideration of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates, and such differencescould affect the results of operations reported in future periods. As the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to develop, many of theseestimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility, and may change materially in future periods.Cash and cash equivalents.  We consider all highly liquid investment securities with original or remaining maturities of three months or less atthe date of purchase to be cash equivalents. We determine the appropriate classification of our cash and cash equivalents at the time of purchase.Trade accounts receivable, net.  Trade accounts receivable are recognized at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Accounts receivableare reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accountsreceivable. We determine the allowance based on customer-specific experience and the aging of such receivables, among other factors. Allowancesfor doubtful accounts were not material as of November 1, 2020 or November 3, 2019. Accounts receivable are also recognized net of sales returnsand distributor credit allowances. These amounts are recognized when it is both probable and estimable that discounts will be granted or productswill be returned. Allowances for sales returns and distributor credit allowances as of November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019 were $174 million and$178 million, respectively.Concentrations of credit risk and significant customers.  Our cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable are potentially subject toconcentration of credit risk. Cash and cash equivalents may be redeemable upon demand and are maintained with several financial institutions thatmanagement believes are of high credit quality and therefore bear minimal credit risk. We seek to mitigate our credit risks by spreading such risksacross multiple counterparties and monitoring the risk profile of these counterparties. Our accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned fromcustomers located both within and outside the U.S. We mitigate collection risks from our customers by performing regular credit evaluations of ourcustomers’ financial conditions, and require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in certain circumstances.Concentration of other risks.  We operate in markets that are highly competitive and rapidly changing. Significant technological changes, shiftingcustomer needs, the emergence of competitive products with new capabilities, general economic conditions worldwide, the ability to safeguardpatents and other intellectual property in a rapidly evolving market and reliance on assembly and test subcontractors, third-party wafer fabricatorsand independent distributors and other factors could affect our financial results.Inventory.  We value our inventory at the lower of actual cost or net realizable value of the inventory, with cost being determined under the first-in, first-out method. We record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecast of product demand and productionrequirements. The excess and obsolete balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess and obsolete inventory charge andthe written-down value of the inventory becomes its new cost basis.Retirement benefits. For defined benefit pension plans, we consider various factors in determining our respective pension liabilities and netperiodic benefit costs, including the number of employees that we expect to receive benefits, their salary levels and years of service, the expectedreturn on plan assets, the discount rate, the timing of the payment of benefits, and other actuarial assumptions. If the actual results and events of theretirement benefit plans differ from our current assumptions, the benefit obligations may be over- or under-valued.Post-retirement benefit plan assets and liabilities are estimates of benefits that we expect to pay to eligible retirees. We consider various factorsin determining the value of our post-retirement benefit plan assets and liabilities, including the number of employees that we expect to receivebenefits and other actuarial assumptions.The key benefit plan assumptions are the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets. The U.S. discount rates are based onthe results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetical yield curve constructed with high-quality corporate bondyields. The U.S. expected rate of return on plan assets is set equal to the discount rate due to the implementation of our fully-matched, liability-driveninvestment strategy. For the non-U.S. plans, we63Table of Contentsset assumptions specific to each country. We have elected to measure defined benefit pension plan and post-retirement benefit plan assets andliabilities as of October 31, which is the month end that is closest to our fiscal year end.Derivative instruments.  We use derivative financial instruments, primarily foreign exchange forward contracts, to manage exposure to foreignexchange risk. Our forward contracts generally mature within three months. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or tradingpurposes.Outstanding derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities at their fair values based on Level 2 inputs as defined in the fair valuehierarchy. The accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and its hedging designation.For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the changes in fair value are recognized in other income, net in the periods of change,and are offset by the changes in fair value of the hedged items. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the changes in fair valueof the effective portion are initially recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax in the period of change, and are subsequentlyreclassified and recognized in other income, net when either the hedged transactions affect earnings or it becomes probable that the hedgedtransactions will not occur. The changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the derivative instruments are recognized in other income, net inthe period of change, which have not been material to date. For derivative instruments not designated as hedges, the changes in fair value arerecognized in other income, net in the period of change. We did not have any outstanding derivative instruments as of November 1, 2020 orNovember 3, 2019.Property, plant and equipment.  Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Additions,improvements and major renewals are capitalized, and maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. Assets are held inconstruction in progress until placed in service, upon which date, we begin to depreciate these assets. When assets are retired or disposed of, theassets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from our property, plant and equipment balances and the resulting gainor loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. Buildings and leasehold improvements are generally depreciated over 15 to40 years, or over the lease period, whichever is shorter, and machinery and equipment are generally depreciated over three to ten years. We use thestraight-line method of depreciation for all property, plant and equipment.Leases. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the arrangement and evaluate whether the lease isan operating lease or a finance lease at the commencement date. We recognize right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities for operating andfinance leases with terms greater than 12 months. ROU assets represent our right to use an asset for the lease term, while lease liabilities representour obligation to make lease payments. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of leasepayments over the lease term at the lease commencement date. We use the implicit interest rate or, if not readily determinable, our incrementalborrowing rate as of the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based onour unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for the effects of collateral. Operating and finance lease ROU assets are recognized net of any leaseprepayments and incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercisethat option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense is recognized based on theeffective-interest method over the lease term.Fair value measurement.  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in anorderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three level hierarchy is applied to prioritize the inputs to valuationtechniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets orliabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the guidance for fair value measurements are described below:Level 1 — Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the abilityto access at the measurement date. Our Level 1 assets include cash equivalents, banker's acceptances, trading securities investments andinvestment funds. We measure trading securities investments and investment funds at quoted market prices as they are traded in active markets withsufficient volume and frequency of transactions.Level 2 — Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly orindirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified contractual term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset orliability.Level 3 — Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability atthe measurement date. Level 3 assets and liabilities include investment in equity securities without readily determinable fair values, goodwill,intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment, which are measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow approach when they areimpaired. Quantitative information for Level 3 assets and liabilities reviewed at each reporting period includes indicators of significant deterioration inthe earnings performance, credit64Table of Contentsrating, asset quality, business prospects of the investee, and financial indicators of the investee's ability to continue as a going concern.Business combinations. We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to recognizeseparately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. While we use our best estimates andassumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, whereapplicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to oneyear from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Uponthe conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, anysubsequent adjustments are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for business combinations requires ourmanagement to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets,contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies, and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although webelieve the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historicalexperience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuingcertain acquired intangible assets under the income approach include growth in future expected cash flows from product sales, customer contractsand acquired technologies, revenue growth rate, customer ramp-up period, technology obsolescence rates, expected costs to develop in-processresearch and development (“IPR&D”) into commercially viable products, estimated cash flows from the projects when completed and discount rates.Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.Goodwill.  Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiableintangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) forimpairment. To review for impairment we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a determination that itis more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. Our qualitative assessment of the recoverabilityof goodwill, whether performed annually or based on specific events or circumstances, considers various macroeconomic, industry-specific andcompany-specific factors. Those factors include: (i) severe adverse industry or economic trends; (ii) significant company-specific actions, includingexiting an activity in conjunction with restructuring of operations; (iii) current, historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance; or (iv) asustained decrease in our market capitalization below our net book value. After assessing the totality of events and circumstances, if we determinethat it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no further assessment is performed. Ifwe determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, we calculate the fair valueof that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit’s net book value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its net bookvalue, there is no impairment. Otherwise, we calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangibleassets, excluding goodwill, of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit. The implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carryingvalue of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized equal to thedifference. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.Long-lived assets. Purchased finite-lived intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recognized overthe periods during which the intangible assets are expected to contribute to our cash flows. Purchased IPR&D projects are capitalized at fair value asan indefinite-lived intangible asset and assessed for impairment thereafter. Upon completion of each underlying project, IPR&D assets arereclassified as amortizable purchased intangible assets and amortized over their estimated useful lives. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, werecognize the carrying value of the related intangible asset in our consolidated statements of operations in the period it is abandoned. On a quarterlybasis, we monitor factors and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including purchased intangibleassets and property, plant and equipment, may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include(i) significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, (ii) significant changes in the manner of our use of theacquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, and (iii) significant negative industry or economic trends. An impairment loss must bemeasured if the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and before interest) from the use and eventual disposition of the asset (or assetgroup) is less than the net book value of the asset (or asset group). The amount of the impairment loss will generally be measured as the differencebetween the net book value of the asset (or asset group) and the estimated fair value.Warranty.  We accrue for the estimated costs of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. Product warranty costs are estimatedbased upon our historical experience and specific identification of the product requirements, which may fluctuate based on product mix. Additionally,we accrue for warranty costs associated with occasional or unanticipated product quality issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonablyestimated.65Table of ContentsRevenue recognition.  We account for a contract with a customer when both parties have approved the contract and are committed to performtheir respective obligations, each party’s rights can be identified, payment terms can be identified, the contract has commercial substance, and it isprobable we will collect substantially all of the consideration we are entitled to. Revenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations aresatisfied by transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer.Nature of Products and ServicesOur products and services can be broadly categorized as sales of products and subscriptions and services. The following is a description of theprincipal activities from which we generate revenue.Products. We recognize revenue from sales to direct customers and distributors when control transfers to the customer. Rebates and incentivesoffered to distributors, which are earned when sales to end customers are completed, are estimated at the point of revenue recognition. We haveelected to exclude from the transaction price any taxes collected from a customer and to account for shipping and handling activities performed aftera customer obtains control of the product as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the product.Subscriptions and services. Our subscriptions and services revenue consists of sales and royalties from software arrangements, supportservices, professional services, transfer of intellectual property (“IP”), and non-recurring engineering (“NRE”) arrangements.Revenue from software arrangements primarily consists of fees, which may be paid either at contract inception or in installments over thecontract term, that provide customers with a right to use the software, access general support and maintenance, and utilize our professional services.Our software licenses have standalone functionality from which customers derive benefit, and the customer obtains control of the software whenit is delivered or made available for download. We believe that for the majority of software arrangements, customers derive significant benefit fromthe ongoing support we provide. The majority of our subscriptions and services arrangements permit our customers to unilaterally terminate or cancelthese arrangements at any time at the customer’s convenience, referred to as termination for convenience provisions, without substantivetermination penalty and receive a pro-rata refund of any prepaid fees. Accordingly, we account for arrangements with these termination forconvenience provisions as a series of daily contracts, resulting in ratable revenue recognition of software revenue over the contractual period.Support services consist primarily of telephone support and the provision of unspecified updates and upgrades on a when-and-if-availablebasis. Support services represent stand-ready obligations for which revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.Professional services consist of implementation, consulting, customer education and customer training services. The obligation to provideprofessional services is generally satisfied over time, with the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefits as we satisfy ourperformance obligations.Rights to our IP are either sold or licensed to a customer. IP revenue recognition is dependent on the nature and terms of each agreement. Werecognize IP revenue upon delivery of the IP if there are no substantive future obligations to perform under the arrangement. Sales-based or usage-based royalties from the license of IP are recognized at the later of the period the sales or usages occur or the satisfaction of the performanceobligation to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-based royalties have been allocated.There are two main categories of NRE contracts that we enter into with our customers: (a) NRE contracts in which we develop a custom chipand (b) NRE contracts in which we accelerate our development of a new chip upon the customer’s request. The majority of our NRE contractrevenues meet the over time criteria. As such, revenue is recognized over the development period with the measure of progress using the inputmethod based on costs incurred to total cost (“cost-to-cost”) as the services are provided. For NRE contracts that do not meet the over time criteria,revenue is recognized at a point in time when the NRE services are complete.Material rights. Contracts with customers may also include material rights that are also performance obligations. These include the right torenew or receive products or services at a discounted price in the future. Revenue allocated to material rights is recognized when the customerexercises the right or the right expires.Arrangements with Multiple Performance ObligationsOur contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately accounted for as a distinctperformance obligation.66Table of ContentsAllocation of consideration. We allocate total contract consideration to each distinct performance obligation in a bundled arrangement on arelative standalone selling price basis. The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were soldseparately in similar circumstances and to similar customers.Standalone selling price. When available, we use directly observable transactions to determine the standalone selling prices for performanceobligations. Our estimates of standalone selling price for each performance obligation require judgment that considers multiple factors, including, butnot limited to, historical discounting trends for products and services and pricing practices through different sales channels, gross margin objectives,internal costs, competitor pricing strategies, technology lifecycles and market conditions.We separately determine the standalone selling prices by product or service type. Additionally, we segment the standalone selling prices forproducts where the pricing strategies differ, and where there are differences in customers and circumstances that warrant segmentation.We also estimate the standalone selling price of our material rights. Lastly, we estimate the value of the customer’s option to purchase orreceive additional products or services at a discounted price by estimating the incremental discount the customer would obtain when exercising theoption and the likelihood that the option would be exercised.Other Policies and JudgmentsContract modifications. We may modify contracts to offer customers additional products or services. Each of the additional products andservices is generally considered distinct from those products or services transferred to the customer before the modification. We evaluate whetherthe contract price for the additional products and services reflects the standalone selling price as adjusted for facts and circumstances applicable tothat contract. In these cases, we account for the additional products or services as a separate contract. In other cases where the pricing in themodification does not reflect the standalone selling price as adjusted for facts and circumstances applicable to that contract, we account for theadditional products or services as part of the existing contract on a prospective basis, on a cumulative catch-up basis, or a combination of both basedon the nature of the modification. In instances where the pricing in the modification offers the customer a credit for a prior arrangement, we adjust ourvariable consideration reserves for returns and other concessions.Right of return. Certain contracts contain a right of return that allows the customer to cancel all or a portion of the product or service and receivea credit. We estimate returns based on historical returns data which is constrained to an amount for which a material revenue reversal is notprobable. We do not recognize revenue for products or services that are expected to be returned.Transition practical expedient elected. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an originalexpected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for servicesperformed. For contracts that were modified before the beginning of the earliest reporting period presented, we have not retrospectively restated thecontract for those modifications. We have disclosed the aggregate effect of all modifications when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfiedperformance obligations for purposes of determining the transaction price and allocating the transaction price at transition.Research and development.  Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers and third partiesengaged in the design and development of our products, software and technologies, including salary, bonus and stock-based compensationexpense, project material costs, services and depreciation. Such costs are charged to research and development expense as they are incurred.Stock-based compensation expense.  We recognize compensation expense for time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”) using the straight-lineamortization method based on the fair value of RSUs on the date of grant. The fair value of RSUs is the closing market price of Broadcom commonstock on the date of grant, reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on Broadcom common stock prior to vesting. We recognizecompensation expense for time-based stock options and employee stock purchase plan rights under the Broadcom Inc. Employee Stock PurchasePlan, as amended (“ESPP”) based on the estimated grant-date fair value determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model with a straight-lineamortization method.Certain equity awards include both service and market conditions. The fair value of market-based awards is estimated on the date of grant usingthe Monte Carlo simulation technique. Compensation expense for market-based awards is amortized based upon a graded vesting method over theservice period.We estimate forfeitures expected to occur and recognize stock-based compensation expense for such awards expected to vest. Changes in theestimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on stock-based compensation expense since the effect of adjusting the rate is recognized inthe period the forfeiture estimate is changed.67Table of ContentsShipping and handling costs. Our shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net revenue and the associated expense isincluded in cost of revenue for all periods presented.Litigation and settlement cost. We are involved in legal actions and other matters arising in our recent business acquisitions and in the normalcourse of business. We recognize an estimated loss contingency when the outcome is probable prior to issuance of the consolidated financialstatements and we are able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any possible loss.Taxes on income.  We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets andliabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. Under this method,deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the consolidated financial statements and tax bases of assetsand liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates ondeferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.We recognize net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination,we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, taxplanning strategies and recent financial operations. If we determine that we are able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excessof their net carrying values, we adjust the valuation allowance and reduce the provision for income taxes or increase the benefit from income taxes.Likewise, if we determine that we are not able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets, we increase the provision for income taxes ordecrease the benefit from income taxes in the period such determination is made.We account for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on income taxes. This guidance providesthat a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained uponexamination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits.Net income per share. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock by the weighted-averagenumber of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable tocommon stock by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during theperiod. Diluted shares outstanding include the dilutive effect of unvested RSUs, in-the-money stock options, and ESPP rights (together referred to as“equity awards”), as well as convertible preferred stock and LP Units. Potentially dilutive shares whose effect would have been antidilutive areexcluded from the computation of diluted net income per share.The dilutive effect of equity awards is calculated based on the average stock price for each fiscal period, using the treasury stock method. Underthe treasury stock method, the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock options and purchasing shares under the ESPP and the amountof compensation cost for future service that we have not yet recognized are collectively assumed to be used to repurchase shares. The dilutive effectof convertible preferred stock and LP Units is calculated using the if-converted method. The if-converted method assumes that these securities wereconverted at the beginning of the reporting period to the extent that the effect is dilutive.Recent Accounting GuidanceIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases(“Topic 842”), which requires a lessee to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for operating leases. At the beginning offiscal year 2020, we adopted Topic 842 using the optional adoption method, whereby no adjustment to the financial statements of comparativeperiods is required. We elected practical expedients which allowed us to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single component. Inaddition, we elected not to reassess whether any expired or existing contracts contain leases and the corresponding lease classification and initialdirect costs. The practical expedients were applied across our lease portfolios. Upon adoption, we recorded net ROU assets of $545 million andlease liabilities of $591 million and there were no cumulative effect adjustments as of November 4, 2019. The net ROU assets included the effect ofreclassifying deferred rent and a portion of facilities-related restructuring reserves as an offset in accordance with the transition guidance. Thestandard did not materially affect the consolidated statement of operations and the consolidated statement of cash flows. See Note 6. “Leases” forfurther information.In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform. This guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions forapplying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference the London InterbankOffered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The amendments in this ASU wereeffective upon issuance and may be applied through December 31, 2022. This guidance had no impact on our contracts, hedging relationships andother transactions as of November 1, 2020.68Table of Contents3. Revenue from Contracts with CustomersDisaggregationWe have considered (1) information that is regularly reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer, who has been identified as the Chief OperatingDecision Maker (the “CODM”) as defined by the authoritative guidance on segment reporting, in evaluating financial performance and (2) disclosurespresented outside of our financial statements in our earnings releases and used in investor presentations to disaggregate revenues. The principalcategory we use to disaggregate revenues is the nature of our products and subscriptions and services, as presented in our consolidated statementsof operations. In addition, revenues by reportable segment are presented in Note 13. “Segment Information”.The following tables present revenue disaggregated by type of revenue and by region for the periods presented:Fiscal Year Ended November 1, 2020AmericasAsia PacificEurope, the Middle Eastand AfricaTotal(In millions)Products$1,775 $14,442 $1,218 $17,435 Subscriptions and services4,059 881 1,513 6,453 Total$5,834 $15,323 $2,731 $23,888 Fiscal Year Ended November 3, 2019AmericasAsia PacificEurope, the Middle Eastand AfricaTotal(In millions)Products$2,023 $14,857 $1,237 $18,117 Subscriptions and services3,126 374 980 4,480 Total$5,149 $15,231 $2,217 $22,597 ________________________________(a) Subscriptions and services predominantly includes software licenses with termination for convenience clauses.Although we recognize revenue for the majority of our products when title and control transfer in Penang, Malaysia, we disclose net revenue byregion based on the geographic shipment or delivery location specified by our distributors, original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) customers,contract manufacturers, channel partners, or software customers.Contract BalancesContract assets and contract liabilities balances were as follows:Contract AssetsContract Liabilities(In millions)Opening balance November 3, 2019$259 $1,808 Closing balance November 1, 2020 $158 $3,443 ________________________________(a) Contract liabilities associated with the Symantec Business were included in the balance as of November 1, 2020.(a)(a)(a)69Table of ContentsChanges in our contract assets and contract liabilities primarily result from the timing difference between our performance and the customer’spayment. We fulfill our obligations under a contract with a customer by transferring products and services in exchange for consideration from thecustomer. We recognize a contract asset when we transfer products or services to a customer and the right to consideration is conditional onsomething other than the passage of time. Accounts receivable are recorded when the customer has been billed or the right to consideration isunconditional. We recognize contract liabilities when we have received consideration or an amount of consideration is due from the customer and wehave a future obligation to transfer products or services. Contract liabilities include amounts billed or collected and advanced payments on contractsor arrangements which may include termination for convenience provisions. The amount of revenue recognized during fiscal year 2020 that wasincluded in the contract liabilities balance as of November 3, 2019 was $1,450 million. The amount of revenue recognized during fiscal year 2019 thatwas included in the contract liabilities balance as of November 5, 2018, the beginning of our fiscal year 2019, was $200 million.Remaining Performance ObligationsRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that areunsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied. It includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods anddoes not include contracts for subscriptions and services where the customer is not committed. The customer is not considered committed whentermination for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty exists, either contractually or through customary business practice. Themajority of our customer software contracts include termination for convenience clauses without a substantive penalty and are accordingly deemed tonot be committed. Additionally, as a practical expedient, we have not included contracts that have an original duration of one year or less nor havewe included contracts with sales-based and usage-based royalties promised in exchange for a license of IP.Because the substantial majority of our customer software contracts allow our customers to terminate for convenience without a substantivepenalty or have an original duration of one year or less, the total amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations as ofNovember 1, 2020 was not material. Since the majority of our software contracts are not deemed to be committed, although our customers generallydo not exercise their termination for convenience rights, and the majority of the contracts we execute for products, as well as subscriptions andservices, have a duration of one year or less, our remaining performance obligations are not indicative of revenue for future periods.4. AcquisitionsAcquisition of the Symantec Corporation Enterprise Security BusinessOn November 4, 2019 (the “Symantec Acquisition Date”), we completed the purchase of the Symantec Business, which was an establishedleader in cyber security, for $10.7 billion in cash (the “Symantec Asset Purchase”). We acquired the Symantec Business to expand our footprint ofmission critical infrastructure software with our existing customer base. The Symantec Business includes a deep and broad mix of products, servicesand solutions, unifying cloud and on-premises security to provide advanced threat protection and information protection across endpoints, network,email and cloud applications. We financed this acquisition with the net proceeds from borrowings under the November 2019 Term Loans, as definedin Note 10. “Borrowings”.The following table presents our allocation of the total purchase price:Fair Value(In millions)Current assets$273 Goodwill6,638 Intangible assets5,411 Other long-term assets92 Total assets acquired12,414 Current liabilities(1,127)Other long-term liabilities(587)Total liabilities assumed(1,714)Fair value of net assets acquired$10,700 70Table of ContentsGoodwill is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and anticipated synergies and economies of scale expected from the integration ofthe Symantec Business. The synergies include certain cost savings, operating efficiencies, and other strategic benefits projected to be achieved as aresult of the Symantec Asset Purchase. Substantially all goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.Current assets and current liabilities included amounts held-for-sale related to the acquired Symantec Cyber Security Services (“CSS”)business. The CSS business was not aligned with our acquisition-date strategic objectives and was sold on April 30, 2020. We do not have anymaterial continuing involvement with this business and have presented its results in discontinued operations.Our results of continuing operations for fiscal year 2020 included $1,610 million of net revenue attributable to the Symantec Business. It wasimpracticable to determine the effect on net income attributable to the Symantec Business as we had integrated the Symantec Business into ourongoing operations during the year. The results of operations of the Symantec Business were included in our infrastructure software segment.Transaction costs related to the Symantec Asset Purchase of $110 million were included in selling, general and administrative expense for fiscal year2020.Intangible AssetsFair ValueWeighted-AverageAmortization Periods(In millions)(In years)Developed technology$2,900 5Customer contracts and related relationships2,410 5Trade name90 6Order backlog11 3Total identified finite-lived intangible assets$5,411 Developed technology relates to products used for cyber security solutions, including data loss prevention, endpoint protection, and web, emailand cloud security solutions. We valued the developed technology using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. Thismethod reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated by the developed technology less chargesrepresenting the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. The economic useful life was determined based on the technology cycle related toeach developed technology, as well as the cash flows over the forecast period.Customer contracts and related relationships represent the fair value of future projected revenue that will be derived from sales of products toexisting customers of the Symantec Business. Customer contracts and related relationships were valued using the with-and-without-method underthe income approach. In the with-and-without method, the fair value was measured by the difference between the present values of the cash flowswith and without the existing customers in place over the period of time necessary to reacquire the customers. The economic useful life wasdetermined by evaluating many factors, including the useful life of other intangible assets, the length of time remaining on the acquired contracts andthe historical customer turnover rates.Trade name relates to the “Symantec” trade name. The fair value was determined by applying the relief-from-royalty method under the incomeapproach. This method is based on the application of a royalty rate to forecasted revenue under the trade name. The economic useful life wasdetermined based on the expected life of the trade name and the cash flows anticipated over the forecast period.Order backlog represents business under existing contractual obligations. The fair value of backlog was determined using the multi-periodexcess earnings method under the income approach based on expected operating cash flows from future contractual revenue. The economic usefullife was determined based on the expected life of the backlog and the cash flows over the forecast period.We believe the amounts of purchased intangible assets recorded above represent the fair values of, and approximate the amounts a marketparticipant would pay for, these intangible assets as of the Symantec Acquisition Date.71Table of ContentsUnaudited Pro Forma InformationThe following unaudited pro forma financial information presents combined results of operations for the periods presented, as if we hadcompleted the Symantec Asset Purchase as of the beginning of fiscal year 2019. The unaudited pro forma information includes adjustments toamortization and depreciation for intangible assets and property, plant and equipment acquired, adjustments to interest expense for the additionalindebtedness incurred to complete the acquisition, restructuring charges related to the acquisition and transaction costs. For the fiscal year 2019,non-recurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the Symantec Asset Purchase included transaction costs of $136 million.

Retirement Plans and Post-Retirement BenefitsPension and Post-Retirement Benefit PlansDefined Benefit Pension Plans.  The U.S. defined benefit pension plans primarily consist of a qualified pension plan. Benefits of the qualifiedpension plan are provided under an adjusted career-average-pay program, a cash-balance program or a dollar-per-month program. Benefit accrualsunder this plan were frozen in 2009. Participants in the adjusted career-average-pay program no longer earn service accruals. Participants in thecash-balance program no longer earn service accruals, but continue to earn 4% interest per year on their cash-balance accounts. There are noactive participants under the dollar-per-month program. We also have a non-qualified supplemental pension plan in the United States that principallyprovides benefits based on compensation in excess of amounts that can be considered under the qualified pension plan.(a)(b)(c)82Table of ContentsWe also have defined benefit pension plans for certain employees in Austria, France, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Japan and Taiwan. Eligibilityis generally determined based on the terms of our plans and local statutory requirements.Post-Retirement Benefit Plans.  Certain of our U.S. employees who meet the retirement eligibility requirements as of their termination dates,may receive post-retirement medical benefits under our retiree medical account program. Majority of the eligible employees receive a medical benefitspending account of $55,000 upon retirement to pay premiums for medical coverage through the maximum age of 75 as a retiree.Our group life insurance plan offers post-retirement life insurance coverage for certain U.S. employees.Net Periodic Benefit (Income) CostPension BenefitsPost-Retirement BenefitsFiscal YearFiscal Year202020192018202020192018(In millions)Service cost$12 $10 $4 $— $— $— Interest cost45 58 51 3 3 3 Expected return on plan assets(46)(59)(51)(3)(3)(4)Other(3)1 1 1 (1)— Net periodic benefit (income) cost$8 $10 $5 $1 $(1)$(1)Net actuarial (gain) loss$(28)$13 $14 $— $11 $(3)The components of net periodic benefit (income) cost other than the service cost are included in other income, net.Funded Status Pension BenefitsPost-Retirement BenefitsNovember 1,2020November 3,2019November 1,2020November 3,2019(In millions)Change in plan assets:    Fair value of plan assets — beginning of period$1,539 $1,394 $85 $81 Actual return on plan assets129 232 5 6 Employer contributions13 15 1 1 Payments from plan assets(96)(94)(3)(3)Foreign currency impact8 (8)— — Fair value of plan assets — end of period1,593 1,539 88 85 Change in benefit obligations:    Benefit obligations — beginning of period1,553 1,364 93 74 Service cost12 10 — — Interest cost45 58 3 3 Actuarial loss61 186 2 14 Benefit payments(96)(94)(3)(3)Curtailments(6)— — — Benefit obligations assumed in an acquisition10 37 — 5 Foreign currency impact9 (8)— — Benefit obligations — end of period1,588 1,553 95 93 Overfunded (underfunded) status of benefit obligations $5 $(14)$(7)$(8)Actuarial losses and prior service costs recognized in accumulated othercomprehensive loss, net of taxes$(94)$(125)$(14)$(15)_________________________________(a)Substantially all amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets were recorded in other long-term assets and other long-term liabilitiesfor all periods presented.(a)83Table of ContentsPlans with benefit obligations in excess of plan assets:Pension BenefitsPost-Retirement BenefitsNovember 1,2020November 3,2019November 1,2020November 3,2019(In millions)Projected benefit obligations$82 $92 $— $— Accumulated benefit obligations$68 $80 $15 $16 Fair value of plan assets$11 $32 $— $— Plans with benefit obligations less than plan assets:Pension BenefitsPost-Retirement BenefitsNovember 1,2020November 3,2019November 1,2020November 3,2019(In millions)Projected benefit obligations$1,506 $1,461 $— $— Accumulated benefit obligations$1,505 $1,460 $80 $77 Fair value of plan assets$1,582 $1,507 $88 $85 The fair value of pension plan assets as of November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019 included $160 million and $151 million, respectively, ofassets for our non-U.S. pension plans.The projected benefit obligations as of November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019 included $206 million and $184 million, respectively, ofobligations related to our non-U.S. pension plans.

Our benefit planinvestment committee has set the investment strategy to fully match the liability. We direct the overall portfolio allocation and use a third-partyinvestment consultant that has the discretion to structure portfolios and select the investment managers within those allocation parameters. Multipleinvestment managers are utilized, including both active and passive management approaches. The plan assets are invested using the liability-driveninvestment strategy intended to minimize market and interest rate risks, and those assets are periodically rebalanced toward asset allocation targets.Substantially all of the plan assets are for the U.S. qualified pension plan. The target asset allocation for this plan reflects a risk/return profilethat we believe is appropriate relative to the liability structure and return goals for the plan. We periodically review the allocation of plan assetsrelative to alternative allocation models to evaluate the need for adjustments based on forecasted liabilities and plan liquidity needs. For both fiscalyears 2020 and 2019, 100% of the U. S. qualified pension plan assets were allocated to fixed income, in line with the target allocation. The fixedincome allocation is primarily directed toward long-term core bond investments, with smaller allocations to Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities andhigh-yield bonds.84Table of ContentsFair Value Measurement of Defined Benefit Pension Plan AssetsNovember 1, 2020Fair Value Measurements at Reporting Date UsingLevel 1Level 2Level 3Total(In millions)Cash equivalents$42 (a)$— $— $42 Equity securities:Non-U.S. equity securities26 (b)— — 26 Fixed-income securities:U.S. treasuries— 158 (c)— 158 Corporate bonds— 1,307 (c)— 1,307 Municipal bonds— 22 (c)— 22 Government bonds— 36 (c)— 36 Asset-backed securities— 2 (c)— 2  Total plan assets$68 $1,525 $— $1,593 November 3, 2019Fair Value Measurements at Reporting Date UsingLevel 1Level 2Level 3Total(In millions)Cash equivalents$34 (a)$— $— $34 Equity securities:Non-U.S. equity securities21 (b)— — 21 Fixed-income securities:U.S. treasuries— 82 (c)— 82 Corporate bonds— 1,372 (c)— 1,372 Municipal bonds— 19 (c)— 19 Government bonds— 10 (c)— 10 Asset-backed securities— 1 (c)— 1  Total plan assets$55 $1,484 $— $1,539 _________________________________(a)Cash equivalents primarily included short-term investment funds which consisted of short-term money market instruments that were valuedbased on quoted prices in active markets.(b)These equity securities were valued based on quoted prices in active markets.(c)These amounts consisted of investments that were traded less frequently than Level 1 securities and were valued using inputs that includedquoted prices for similar assets in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices that were observable for the assets, such as interest rates,yield curves, prepayment speeds, collateral performance, broker/dealer quotes and indices that were observable at commonly quoted intervals.Post-Retirement Benefit Plan Investment PolicyOur overall investment strategy for the group life insurance plan is to allocate assets in a manner that seeks to both maximize the safety ofpromised benefits and minimize the cost of funding those benefits. The target asset allocation for plan assets reflects a risk/return profile that webelieve is appropriate relative to the liability structure and return goals for the plan. We periodically review the allocation of plan assets relative toalternative allocation models to evaluate the need for adjustments based on forecasted liabilities and plan liquidity needs. We set the overall portfolioallocation and use an investment manager that directs the investment of funds consistent with that allocation. The investment manager invests theplan assets in index funds that it manages. For both fiscal years 2020 and 2019, 100% of plan assets were allocated to85Table of Contentscommingled funds that invested in fixed income, in line with the target allocation. The fair value of the commingled funds are measured using netasset value per share as a practical expedient.Assumptions  The assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit (income) cost from our defined benefit pension plans andpost-retirement benefit plans are presented in the tables below. The expected long-term return on assets shown in the tables below represents anestimate of long-term returns on investment portfolios primarily consisting of combinations of debt, equity and other investments, depending on theplan. The long-term rates of return are then weighted based on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which we expect the pension andpost-retirement funds to be invested. Discount rates reflect the current rate at which defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit obligationscould be settled based on the measurement dates of the plans, which is October 31, the month end closest to our fiscal year end. The range ofassumptions that are used for defined benefit pension plans reflects the different economic environments within various countries.Assumptions for Benefit Obligationsas ofAssumptions for Net Periodic Benefit (Income) CostFiscal YearNovember 1,2020November 3,2019202020192018Defined benefit pension plans:     Discount rate0.61%-6.54%0.47%-7.00%0.47%-7.00%0.50%-8.00%0.50%-7.00%Average increase in compensation levels2.00%-10.00%2.00%-10.00%2.00%-10.00%1.80%-10.00%2.00%-11.00%Expected long-term return on assetsN/AN/A1.50%-7.80%1.50%-7.75%1.50%-7.50%Assumptions for Benefit Obligationsas ofAssumptions for Net Periodic Benefit (Income) CostFiscal YearNovember 1,2020November 3,2019202020192018Post-retirement benefit plans:     Discount rate2.10%-2.90%2.80%-3.20%2.80%-3.20%4.12%-4.60%3.40%-3.80%Average increase in compensation levels3.00%3.00%3.00%3.00%3.00%Expected long-term return on assetsN/AN/A3.20%4.80%4.80%Assumed Health Care Cost Trend Rate Usedto Measure the Expected Cost of Benefits asofNovember 1,2020November 3,2019Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year7.25%4.50%-7.40%Rate to which the health care cost trend rate is assumed to decline (ultimate health care cost trend rate)4.50%3.50%-4.50%Year that the rate reaches the ultimate health care cost trend rate20292031A one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rates would not have had a material effect on theaccumulated post-retirement benefit obligations or service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit cost for any periods presented.Defined Contribution PlansOur eligible U.S. employees participate in a company-sponsored 401(k) plan. Under the plan, we provide matching contributions to employeesup to 6% of their eligible earnings. All matching contributions vest immediately.

As of November 1, 2020, 3 million shares remained available for issuance under the 2003 Plan.2012 PlanIn connection with the acquisition of BRCM, we assumed the BRCM 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”) and outstanding unvestedRSUs originally granted by BRCM under the 2012 Plan that were held by continuing employees. Under the 2012 Plan, we may grant to formeremployees of BRCM and other employees who were not employees of Broadcom at the time of the acquisition restricted stock awards, RSUs, stockoptions and stock appreciation rights with an exercise price that is no less than the fair market value on the date of grant. No participant may begranted stock options, restricted stock or92Table of ContentsRSUs, covering more than an aggregate of 4 million shares in any fiscal year. Equity awards granted under the 2012 Plan following the acquisition ofBRCM are on similar terms and consistent with similar grants made pursuant to the 2009 Plan. As of November 1, 2020, 95 million shares remainedavailable for issuance under the 2012 Plan. The number of shares available for issuance under the 2012 Plan is subject to an annual increase of 12million shares.We also grant market-based RSUs with both a service condition and a market condition as part of our equity compensation programs. Themarket-based RSUs generally vest over four years, subject to satisfaction of market conditions. During fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, we grantedmarket-based RSUs under which grantees may receive the number of shares ranging from 0% to 200% of the original grant at vesting based uponthe total stockholder return (“TSR”) on our common stock as compared to the TSR of an index group of companies.Amendment to the RSU Vesting ScheduleDuring fiscal year 2019, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved an amendment to the vesting of time-based RSUs(other than those assumed in an acquisition), held by approximately 16,500 employees below the vice president level, from an annual vesting cycleto a quarterly vesting cycle.Employee Stock Purchase PlanThe ESPP provides eligible employees with the opportunity to acquire an ownership interest in us through periodic payroll deductions, based ona 6-month look-back period, at a price equal to the lesser of 85% of the fair market value of our common stock at either the beginning or the end ofthe relevant offering period. The ESPP is structured as a qualified employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of1986. However, the ESPP is not intended to be a qualified pension, profit sharing or stock bonus plan under Section 401(a) of the Internal RevenueCode of 1986 and is not subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.Stock-Based Compensation Expense Fiscal Year202020192018(In millions)Cost of products sold$109 $120 $77 Cost of subscriptions and services50 43 9 Research and development1,419 1,532 855 Selling, general and administrative398 490 286 Total stock-based compensation expense $1,976 $2,185 $1,227 Estimated income tax benefits for stock-based compensation$345 $400 $195 Income tax benefits for stock-based awards exercised or released$147 $232 $181 _______________________________________________________(a)Fiscal year 2019 stock-based compensation expense does not include $75 million restructuring charges for accelerated vesting of assumedequity awards held by employees terminated in connection with the CA Merger.We have assumed an annualized forfeiture rate for RSUs of 5%. We will recognize additional expense if actual forfeitures are lower than weestimated, and will recognize a benefit if actual forfeitures are higher than we estimated.During the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved a broad-based program of multi-year equity grants of time- and market-based RSUs (the “Multi-Year Equity Awards”) in lieu of our annual employee equity awards historically grantedon March 15 of each year. Each Multi-Year Equity Award vests on the same basis as four annual grants made March 15 of each year, beginning infiscal year 2019, with successive four-year vesting periods. Stock-based compensation expense related to the Multi-Year Equity Awards was $902million and $890 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.In connection with the amendment to the vesting of certain time-based RSUs from an annual cycle to a quarterly cycle, we recognizedapproximately $140 million in incremental compensation cost during fiscal year 2019.As of November 1, 2020, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based awards was $4,021 million, which isexpected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average service period of 3.4 years.(a)93Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the weighted-average assumptions utilized to calculate the fair value of market-based awards granted in theperiods presented:Market-Based AwardsFiscal Year202020192018Risk-free interest rate1.2 %2.7 %2.4 %Dividend yield4.7 %4.4 %2.6 %Volatility31.2 %33.0 %32.5 %Expected term (in years)4.04.04.0The risk-free interest rate was derived from the average U.S. Treasury Strips rate, which approximated the rate in effect appropriate for the termat the time of grant.The dividend yield was based on the historical and expected dividend payouts as of the respective award grant dates.The volatility was based on our own historical stock price volatility over the period commensurate with the expected life of the awards and theimplied volatility of a 180-day call option on our own common stock measured at a specific date.The expected term was commensurate with the awards’ contractual terms.Restricted Stock Unit AwardsA summary of time- and market-based RSU activity is as follows:Number of RSUsOutstandingWeighted-AverageGrant DateFair ValuePer Share(In millions, except per share data)Balance as of October 29, 201718 $163.42 Granted7 $239.48 Vested(6)$155.78 Forfeited(1)$175.46 Balance as of November 4, 201818 $195.50 Assumed in CA Merger1 $206.14 Granted33 $183.64 Vested(10)$192.28 Forfeited(2)$182.80 Balance as of November 3, 201940 $188.52 Granted3 $252.36 Vested(8)$210.84 Forfeited(3)$198.17 Balance as of November 1, 202032 $188.35 The aggregate fair value of time- and market-based RSUs that vested in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $2,254 million, $2,958 millionand $1,516 million, respectively, which represents the market value of our common stock on the date that the RSUs vested.

Income TaxesComponents of Income from Continuing Operations Before Income TaxesThe following table presents the components of income from continuing operations before income taxes for financial reporting purposes: Fiscal Year202020192018(In millions)Domestic loss$(4,221)$(4,116)$(705)Foreign income6,664 6,342 5,250 Income from continuing operations before income taxes$2,443 $2,226 $4,545 Components of Benefit from Income TaxesThe benefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to jurisdictional mix of income and expense, the recognition of grossuncertain tax benefits as a result of lapses of statutes of limitations, the remeasurement of certain foreign deferred tax assets and liabilities, andexcess tax benefits from stock-based awards.The benefit from income taxes in fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock-based awards, the recognition of grossunrecognized tax benefits as a result of audit settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations net of increases in balances related to tax positionstaken during the year, deferred tax remeasurement in state and foreign jurisdictions, internal reorganizations, and the partial release of our valuationallowance as a result of the CA Merger, partly offset by a change in estimate of our fiscal year 2018 provision resulting from regulations issuedrelated to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“2017 Tax Reform Act”).The benefit from income taxes in the fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to income tax benefits recognized from the enactment of the 2017 TaxReform Act and as a result of our redomiciliation to the United States on April 4, 2018.We have obtained several tax incentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board which provide that qualifying income earned inSingapore is subject to tax incentives or reduced rates of Singapore income tax. Each tax incentive is separate and distinct from the others and maybe granted, withheld, extended, modified, truncated, complied with, or terminated independently without any effect on the other incentives. Subject toour compliance with the conditions specified in these incentives and legislative developments, the Singapore tax incentive is scheduled to expire inNovember 2025.95Table of ContentsWe have also obtained a tax holiday on our qualifying income in Malaysia, which is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2028. The tax holiday thatwe negotiated in Malaysia is also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions. If we cannot, or elect not to, comply with anysuch conditions specified, we will lose the related tax benefits and we could be required to refund previously realized material tax benefits.Before taking into consideration the effects of the 2017 Tax Reform Act and other indirect tax impacts, the effect of these tax incentives and taxholiday was to increase the benefit from income taxes by approximately $833 million, $923 million and $590 million for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and2018, respectively.Significant components of benefit from income taxes are as follows: Fiscal Year202020192018(In millions)Current tax expense (benefit from):   Federal$7 $(49)$255 State51 (16)38 Foreign506 342 171  564 277 464 Deferred tax expense (benefit from):   Federal(627)(497)(8,666)State(161)(113)(103)Foreign(294)(177)221  (1,082)(787)(8,548)Total benefit from income taxes$(518)$(510)$(8,084)Rate Reconciliation Fiscal Year202020192018Statutory tax rate21.0 %21.0 %21.0 %State, net of federal benefit(3.6)(4.6)(1.1)2017 Tax Reform Act— 5.1 (159.0)Redomiciliation transaction withholding tax remeasurement— — (25.6)Foreign income taxed at different rates(48.6)(52.5)(16.3)Deemed inclusion of foreign earnings21.8 25.9 4.7 Deferred taxes on unremitted foreign earnings(1.1)1.9 0.4 Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation(6.0)(10.4)(4.0)Research and development credit(4.3)(7.6)(2.9)Other, net(0.4)(1.7)4.9 Effective tax rate on income before income taxes(21.2)%(22.9)%(177.9)%96Table of ContentsSummary of Deferred Income TaxesNovember 1,2020November 3,2019(In millions)Deferred income tax assets:  Net operating loss, credit and other carryforwards$1,773 $1,733 Deferred revenue529 316 Employee stock awards273 218 Other deferred income tax assets392 313 Gross deferred income tax assets2,967 2,580 Less: valuation allowance(1,707)(1,563)Deferred income tax assets1,260 1,017 Deferred income tax liabilities:Depreciation and amortization1,477 2,360 Foreign earnings not indefinitely reinvested112 138 Deferred income tax liabilities1,589 2,498 Net deferred income tax liabilities$(329)$(1,481)Deferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financialreporting purposes and their basis for income tax purposes and the tax effects of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. The decrease innet deferred income tax liabilities was primarily a result of the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets included in the consolidatedstatement of operations.In connection with the Symantec Asset Purchase in November 2019, we established $28 million of net deferred tax assets primarily as a resultof the difference in book basis and tax basis related to acquired assets. In connection with the CA Merger in November 2018, we established $2,434million of net deferred tax liabilities on the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of acquired identified intangible assets and investments incertain foreign subsidiaries that had not been indefinitely reinvested, partially offset by acquired tax attributes.We continue to indefinitely reinvest $2,677 million of certain accumulated foreign earnings. The unrecognized deferred income tax liabilityrelated to these earnings is estimated to be $281 million. All other current and future earnings of all our foreign subsidiaries are not consideredpermanently reinvested.The following table presents net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) as reflected on the consolidated balance sheets:November 1,2020November 3,2019(In millions)Other long-term assets$240 $50 Other long-term liabilities(569)(1,531)Net long-term income tax liabilities$(329)$(1,481)The increase in the valuation allowance to $1,707 million in fiscal year 2020 from $1,563 million in fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to federaland state deferred tax assets arising from credits and net operating loss carryforwards not expected to be realized.As of November 1, 2020, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $67 million, U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards of$2,951 million and other foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $1,126 million. U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin toexpire in our fiscal year ending October 31, 2021 (“fiscal year 2021”). The other foreign net operating losses expire in various fiscal years beginning2021. As of November 1, 2020, we had $301 million and $1,759 million of U.S. federal and state research and development tax credits, respectively,which if not utilized, begin to expire in fiscal year 2021.The U.S. Tax Reform Act of 1986 limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the case of an “ownership change” of acorporation or separate return loss year limitations. Any ownership changes, as defined, may restrict the utilization of carryforwards. As ofNovember 1, 2020, we had approximately $67 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. subject to an annual limitation. We donot expect these limitations to result in any permanent loss of our tax benefits.97Table of ContentsUncertain Tax PositionsGross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $326 million during fiscal year 2020, resulting in gross unrecognized tax benefits of $4,748 millionas of November 1, 2020.Gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $392 million during fiscal year 2019, resulting in gross unrecognized tax benefits of $4,422 millionas of November 3, 2019.Gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $1,774 million during fiscal year 2018, resulting in gross unrecognized tax benefits of $4,030million as of November 4, 2018. The increase in gross unrecognized tax benefits was primarily due to the recognition of unrecognized tax positions of$1,112 million related to the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of accumulated non-U.S. earnings of U.S. controlled foreigncorporations, offset by a reduction of our federal deferred income tax liabilities on accumulated non-U.S. earnings. The increase in grossunrecognized tax benefits was also as a result of our redomiciliation to the United States on April 4, 2018, and to a lesser extent, the BrocadeMerger.We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the benefit from income taxes. Accrued interest and penaltieswere included within other long-term liabilities. During fiscal years 2020 and 2018, we recognized interest and penalties of $37 million and$59 million, respectively, within the benefit from income taxes. There was no amount recognized during fiscal year 2019. As of November 1, 2020and November 3, 2019, the combined amount of cumulative accrued interest and penalties was approximately $340 million and $303 million,respectively.The following table reconciles the beginning and ending balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits:Fiscal Year202020192018(In millions)Beginning balance$4,422 $4,030 $2,256 Lapses of statutes of limitations(95)(36)(20)Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods (includingthose related to acquisitions made during the year)98 467 361 Decreases in balances related to tax positions taken during prior periods(14)(270)(289)Increases in balances related to tax positions taken during current period379 460 1,726 Decreases in balances related to settlements with taxing authorities(42)(229)(4)Ending balance$4,748 $4,422 $4,030 A portion of our unrecognized tax benefits will affect our effective tax rate if they are recognized upon favorable resolution of the uncertain taxpositions. As of November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019, approximately $5,088 million and $4,725 million of the unrecognized tax benefits andaccrued interest and penalties would affect our effective tax rate, respectively.We are subject to U.S. income tax examination for fiscal years 2013 and later. Certain of our acquired companies are subject to taxexaminations in major jurisdictions outside of the U.S. for fiscal years 2008 and later. It is possible that our existing unrecognized tax benefits maychange up to $261 million as a result of lapses of the statute of limitations for certain audit periods and/or audit examinations expected to becompleted within the next 12 months.13. Segment InformationReportable SegmentsDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, we updated our organizational structure resulting in two reportable segments: semiconductorsolutions and infrastructure software. Each segment represents a component for which separate financial information is available that is utilized on aregular basis by the CODM in determining how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. The reportable segments are determined based onseveral factors including, but not limited to, customer base, homogeneity of products, technology, delivery channels and similar economiccharacteristics.Semiconductor solutions. We provide semiconductor solutions for managing the movement of data in data center, telecom, enterprise andembedded networking applications. We provide a broad variety of radio frequency semiconductor devices, wireless connectivity solutions andcustom touch controllers for mobile applications. We also provide semiconductor solutions for enabling the set-top box and broadband accessmarkets and for enabling secure movement of digital data to and from host machines, such as servers, personal computers and storage systems, tothe underlying storage devices, such as hard disk drives and solid state drives. We also provide a broad variety of products for the general industrialand automotive markets. Our semiconductor solutions segment also includes our IP licensing.98Table of ContentsInfrastructure software. We provide a portfolio of mainframe, enterprise and storage area networking solutions, which enables customers toleverage the benefits of agility, automation, insights, resiliency and security in managing business processes and technology investments, and toreduce the cost and complexity of managing business information within a shared storage environment. We also offer a cyber security solutionsportfolio, including data loss prevention, endpoint protection, and web, email and cloud security solutions.Our CODM assesses the performance of each segment and allocates resources to each segment based on net revenue and operating resultsand does not evaluate each segment using discrete asset information. Operating results by segment include items that are directly attributable toeach segment and also include shared expenses such as global operations, including manufacturing support, logistics and quality control, expensesassociated with selling, general and administrative activities, facilities and information technology expenses. Shared expenses are primarily allocatedbased on revenue and headcount.During the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2020, we refined our allocation methodology for certain selling, general and administrative expensesto more closely align these costs with the segment benefiting from the shared expenses. Prior period segment results have been recast to conform tothe current presentation.Unallocated ExpensesUnallocated expenses include amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring,impairment and disposal charges, acquisition-related costs, charges related to inventory step-up to fair value, and other costs, which are not used inevaluating the results of, or in allocating resources to, our segments. Acquisition-related costs also include transaction costs and any costs directlyrelated to the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses.Depreciation expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODMdoes not evaluate depreciation expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There was no inter-segment revenue forany of the periods presented. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accountingpolicies.Fiscal Year202020192018(In millions)Net revenue:Semiconductor solutions$17,267 $17,441 $19,068 Infrastructure software6,621 5,156 1,780 Total net revenue$23,888 $22,597 $20,848 Operating income:Semiconductor solutions$8,576 $8,538 $9,253 Infrastructure software4,363 3,391 1,157 Unallocated expenses(8,925)(8,485)(5,275)Total operating income$4,014 $3,444 $5,135 Geographic InformationNet revenue by country is based on the geographic shipment or delivery location as specified by the distributors, OEMs, contract manufacturers,channel partners, or software customers who purchased our products or services. For the majority of our products, title and control transfer to ourcustomers in Penang, Malaysia. The products are then transported to the customer specific locations. Net revenue from the United States for fiscalyears 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $4,778 million, $4,235 million and $2,697 million, respectively. Net revenue from China (including Hong Kong) forfiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $7,808 million, $8,056 million and $10,305 million, respectively. Net revenue from Singapore for fiscal year2019 was $2,507 million (amounts were less than 10% for fiscal years 2020 and 2018). Net revenue from other foreign countries for fiscal years2020, 2019 and 2018 was $11,302 million, $7,799 million and $7,846 million, respectively. These geographic delivery locations are not necessarilyindicative of the geographic location of our end customers or the country in which our end customers sell devices containing our products. Forexample, we believe a substantial portion of our products shipped or delivered to China (including Hong Kong) is included in devices sold by our endcustomers in the United States and Europe.Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment and are based on the physical location of the assets.99Table of ContentsNovember 1,2020November 3,2019(In millions)Long-lived assets:United States$1,659 $1,763 Taiwan285 258 Other565 544 Total long-lived assets$2,509 $2,565 Significant Customer InformationWe sell our products through our direct sales force and a select network of distributors and channel partners globally. No customer accountedfor 10% or more of our net accounts receivable balance at November 1, 2020 compared with one customer which accounted for 24% of our netaccounts receivable balance at November 3, 2019. During fiscal years 2020 and 2019, one customer accounted for 13% and 17% of our netrevenue, respectively. Revenue from this customer was included in our semiconductor solutions segment. During fiscal year 2018, no customeraccounted for 10% or more of our net revenue.14. Commitments and ContingenciesCommitmentsThe following table summarizes contractual obligations and commitments as of November 1, 2020:Fiscal Year:Purchase CommitmentsOther ContractualCommitments(In millions)2021$894 $248 202272 221 2023— 209 2024— 157 2025— 63 Thereafter— 239 Total$966 $1,137 Purchase Commitments. Represents unconditional purchase obligations that include agreements to purchase goods or services, primarilyinventory, that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased,fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that arecancelable without penalty. Cancellation for outstanding purchase orders for capital expenditures in connection with construction of our newcampuses is generally allowed but requires payment of all costs incurred through the date of cancellation and, therefore, cancelable purchase ordersfor these capital expenditures are included in the table above.Other Contractual Commitments. Represents amounts payable pursuant to agreements related to IT, human resources, and other serviceagreements.Due to the inherent uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash outflows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at November 1,2020, we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities. Therefore, $3,185 million ofunrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest classified within other long-term liabilities as of November 1, 2020 have been excluded from thecontractual obligations table above.Standby Letters of CreditAs of November 1, 2020 and November 3, 2019, we had standby letters of credit of $65 million and $62 million, respectively. Standby letters ofcredit are financial guarantees provided by third parties for leases, customs, taxes and certain self-insured risks. If the guarantees are called, wemust reimburse the provider of the guarantees.ContingenciesFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation that we believe is of the type common to companies engaged in our lines of business, includingcommercial disputes, employment issues, tax disputes and disputes involving claims by third parties that our activities infringe their patent, copyright,trademark or other IP rights, as well regulatory investigations or inquiries. Legal proceedings and regulatory investigations or inquiries are oftencomplex, may require the expenditure of significant100Table of Contentsfunds and other resources, and the outcome of such proceedings is inherently uncertain, with material adverse outcomes possible. IP propertyclaims generally involve the demand by a third-party that we cease the manufacture, use or sale of the allegedly infringing products, processes ortechnologies and/or pay substantial damages or royalties for past, present and future use of the allegedly infringing IP. Claims that our products orprocesses infringe or misappropriate any third-party IP rights (including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers) ofteninvolve highly complex, technical issues, the outcome of which is inherently uncertain. Moreover, from time to time, we pursue litigation to assert ourIP rights. Regardless of the merit or resolution of any such litigation, complex IP litigation is generally costly and diverts the efforts and attention ofour management and technical personnel.Lawsuits Relating to California Institute of TechnologyCalifornia Institute of Technology ("Caltech") filed a complaint against Broadcom and Apple Inc. on May 26, 2016 in the United States DistrictCourt for the Central District of California (the “U.S. Central District Court”), and an amended complaint adding Cypress Semiconductor Corporationas a defendant on August 15, 2016. The amended complaint alleged that chips that support certain error correction codes as specified in IEEEStandards 802.11n and 802.11ac willfully infringed four patents related to error correction coding: U.S. Patent Nos. 7,116,710; 7,421,032; 7,916,781;and 8,284,833 (“’833 patent”). Prior to trial, Caltech dismissed its claims against Cypress and withdrew its infringement allegations as to ‘833 patent.The complaint sought a preliminary and permanent injunction, damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, as well as attorneys’ fees, costs, andexpenses. The trial was held in January 2020, and on January 29, 2020, the jury issued its verdict finding infringement and awarding Caltech pastdamages of $270.2 million from Broadcom and $837.8 million from Apple, for which Apple is seeking indemnification from Broadcom. On August 3,2020, the U.S. Central District Court issued its judgment, awarding Caltech past damages in the amounts awarded by the jury, as well as pre- andpost-judgment interest. Additionally, the U.S. Central District Court awarded Caltech an unspecified amount of ongoing royalties to be determinedafter the anticipated appeals process is resolved. Neither the jury nor the U.S. Central District Court found willful infringement, which if it had, couldhave resulted in enhanced damages up to three times the amount awarded. Broadcom and Apple have appealed to the United States Court ofAppeals for the Federal Circuit.We believe that the evidence and the law do not support the U.S. Central District Court’s findings of infringement or the award of damages,including ongoing royalties, and do not believe a material loss is probable at this time. We believe that there are strong grounds for appeal, and weintend to vigorously challenge the U.S. Central District Court’s judgment and rulings. As a result, we have not recorded a reserve with respect to thislitigation, in accordance with the applicable accounting standards. We believe the low end of the possible range of loss is zero, but we cannotreasonably estimate the ultimate outcome, as a number of factors (including the appeal by Broadcom and Apple) could significantly change theassessment of damages.Lawsuits Relating to the Acquisition of Emulex CorporationOn April 8, 2015, a putative class action complaint was filed in the U.S. Central District Court, entitled Gary Varjabedian, et al. v. EmulexCorporation, et al., No. 8:15-cv-554-CJC-JCG. The complaint names as defendants Emulex Corporation (“Emulex”), its directors, AvagoTechnologies Wireless (U.S.A.) Manufacturing (“AT Wireless”) and Emerald Merger Sub, and purported to assert claims under Sections 14(d), 14(e)and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The complaint alleged, among other things, that the board ofdirectors of Emulex failed to provide material information and/or omitted material information from the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement onSchedule 14D-9 filed with the SEC on April 7, 2015 by Emulex, together with the exhibits and annexes thereto. The complaint sought to enjoin thetender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Emulex common stock, as well as certain other equitable relief and attorneys’ fees andcosts. On July 28, 2015, the U.S. Central District Court issued an order appointing the lead plaintiff and approving lead counsel for the putative class.On September 9, 2015, plaintiff filed a first amended complaint seeking rescission of the merger, unspecified money damages, other equitable reliefand attorneys’ fees and costs. On October 13, 2015, defendants moved to dismiss the first amended complaint, which the U.S. Central District Courtgranted with prejudice on January 13, 2016.

However,lawsuits may involve complex questions of fact and law and may require the expenditure of significant funds and other resources to defend. Theresults of litigation or regulatory investigations are inherently uncertain, and material adverse outcomes are possible. From time to time, we mayenter into confidential discussions regarding the potential settlement of such lawsuits. Any settlement of pending litigation could require us to incursubstantial costs and other ongoing expenses, such as future royalty payments in the case of an IP dispute.During the periods presented, no material amounts have been accrued or disclosed in the accompanying consolidated financial statements withrespect to loss contingencies associated with any other legal proceedings or regulatory investigations, as potential losses for such matters are notconsidered probable and ranges of losses are not reasonably estimable. These matters are subject to many uncertainties and the ultimate outcomesare not predictable. There can be no assurances that the actual amounts required to satisfy any liabilities arising from the matters described abovewill not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.Other IndemnificationsAs is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, many of our standard contracts provideremedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts, such as defense, settlement, or payment of judgment for IP claims relatedto the use of our products. From time to time, we indemnify customers, as well as our suppliers, contractors, lessors, lessees, companies thatpurchase our businesses or assets and others with whom we enter into contracts, against combinations of loss, expense, or liability arising fromvarious triggering events related to the sale and the use of our products, the use of their goods and services, the use of facilities and state of ourowned facilities, the state of the assets and businesses that we sell and other matters covered by such contracts, usually up to a specified maximumamount. In addition, from time to time we also provide protection to these parties against claims related to undiscovered liabilities, additional productliabilities or environmental obligations. In our experience, claims made under such indemnifications are rare and the associated estimated fair valueof the liability is not material.15.

The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to bedisclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within thetime periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designedto ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated andcommunicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regardingrequired disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide onlyreasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship ofpossible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of November 1, 2020, our CEO and CFOconcluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.(1) (2)105Table of ContentsManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control overfinancial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under thesupervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Board, management and other personnel, to providereasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordancewith GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:•pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets;•provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance withGAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of us are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and•provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets thatcould have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of anyevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or thatthe degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of November 1, 2020. In making thisassessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in InternalControl-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of November 1, 2020, our internal control overfinancial reporting is effective based on those criteria.The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as of November 1, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part II, Item 8. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingNo change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred duringthe fourth quarter ended November 1, 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financialreporting. Although we have modified our workplace practices globally due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in most of our employees workingremotely, this has not meaningfully affected our internal controls over financial reporting. We are continually monitoring and assessing the COVID-19situation on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their design and operating effectiveness.ITEM 9B.OTHER INFORMATIONNone.106Table of ContentsPART IIIITEM 10.DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCEThe information regarding our directors and executive officers, set forth in the sections entitled “Proposal 1 — Election of Directors,” “ExecutiveOfficers” and “Corporate Governance,” in our definitive Proxy Statement for our 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be filed with the SEC within120 days of the end of our 2020 fiscal year pursuant to General Instruction G(3) to Form 10-K is hereby incorporated by reference in this section.We have adopted a written Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that applies to all of our employees and directors, including our principalexecutive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, or persons performing similar functions and have posted it in the“Investors Center — Governance” section of our website, which is located at www.broadcom.com.
