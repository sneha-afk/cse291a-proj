1321336.2.2 Strategic RisksRisks Associated with Changes in Technology and Industry●Industry DevelopmentsThe electronics industries and semiconductor market are cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid fluctuations in product demand, which could impact TSMC’s semiconductor foundry business. Variations in customer order levels may result in volatility in the Company’s revenue and earnings.From time to time, the electronics and semiconductor industries have experienced significant and occasionally prolonged periods of downturns and overcapacity. Because TSMC is, and will continue to be, dependent on the demand of electronics and semiconductor companies for its services, periods of downturns and overcapacity in the general electronics and semiconductor industries could lead to reduced demand for overall semiconductor foundry services, including TSMC’s services. If TSMC is not able to take appropriate actions, such as reducing its costs to sufficiently offset declines in demand, the Company’s revenue, margins and earnings will likely suffer during periods of downturns and overcapacity.●Changes in TechnologyThe semiconductor industry and its technologies are constantly changing. TSMC competes by developing process technologies using increasingly advanced nodes and manufacturing products with more functions. The Company also competes by developing new derivative technologies. If TSMC does not anticipate these changes in technologies and rapidly develop new and innovative technologies, or the Company’s competitors unforeseeably gain sudden access to additional technologies, TSMC may not be able to provide foundry services on competitive terms. For example, the global surge in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) has had a significant impact on customer demand for advanced semiconductor chips and the market dynamics in TSMC’s industry; thus, TSMC’s ability to continuously develop relevant technologies, products and services to meet these customer needs and changes in the AI industry will be critical for the Company to effectively compete in this space. TSMC also believes that the effective use of AI in its internal operations is important to its long-term success. As the AI technologies are rapidly evolving, if TSMC is unable to deploy new AI technologies in its internal operations as effectively as its competitors, it may hurt the Company’s competitive position. In addition, TSMC’s customers have significantly decreased the time in which their products or services are launched into the market. If TSMC is unable to meet these shorter product time-to-market, it risks losing these customers. These factors have also been intensified by the shift of the global technology market to consumer driven products, such as smartphones, and increasing competition and concentration of customers (all further discussed among these risk factors).Also, the uncertainty and instability inherent in advanced technologies impose challenges for achieving expected product quality and product yield. If TSMC fails to maintain quality, it may result in loss of revenue and additional cost, as well as loss of business or customer trust. If TSMC is unable to overcome the above factors, it may become less competitive and its revenue may decline significantly.Regarding the response measures for the above-mentioned risks, please refer to “2.2.4 TSMC Position, Differentiation and Strategy” on page 17-19 of this Annual Report.●IT SecurityEven though TSMC has established a comprehensive internet and computing security network, the Company cannot guarantee that its computing systems which control or maintain vital corporate functions, such as its manufacturing operations and enterprise accounting, would be completely immune to crippling cyberattacks. In the event of a serious cyberattack, TSMC’s systems may lose important corporate data or its production lines may be shut down pending the resolution of such attack. Major cyberattacks could also lead to loss or divulgence of trade secrets and other sensitive information, such as proprietary information of its customers and other stakeholders and personal information of its employees. While TSMC seeks to continuously review and assess its cybersecurity policies and procedures to ensure their adequacy and effectiveness, it cannot guarantee that it will not be susceptible to new and emerging risks and attacks in the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats. For example, as AI continues to evolve, cyber-attackers could also use AI to develop malicious codes and sophisticated phishing attempts.Malicious hackers may also try to introduce computer viruses, corrupted software or ransomware into TSMC’s network systems to disrupt its operations, or blackmail the Company to regain control of its computing systems, or spy on it for sensitive information. These attacks may result in TSMC having to pay damages for its delayed or disrupted orders or incur significant expenses in implementing remedial and improvement measures to further enhance its cybersecurity network, and may also expose the Company to significant legal liabilities arising from or related to legal proceedings or regulatory investigations associated with such breaches.In the past, TSMC has experienced and may in the future be subject to attack by malicious software. The Company has implemented and continually updates rigorous cybersecurity measures to prevent and minimize harm caused by such attacks. These measures comprehensively enhance security protection capabilities across internet services, offices, fabs, and cloud platforms. In addition, TSMC consistently strengthens the security of its offices, facilities, and data centers worldwide to ensure operational stability and data integrity. As a result, TSMC’s scores in international security assessments are significantly higher than the industry average, demonstrating the Company’s ongoing commitment to and high regard for cybersecurity.In 2024, TSMC focused on enhancing network security visibility in its fabs, improving fab network architecture and control to prevent the spread of viruses across tools and fabs, and conducting comprehensive threat monitoring in data centers. The Company has implemented automated end-to-end scanning protection from offices to data centers, established robust cloud service security posture management (tools and practices that monitor, detect, and remediate security risks across cloud environments), and adopted secure configurations for unified external website security. TSMC has also implemented device authentication and control in office environments, created a global virtual office environment to enable employees to use computers and systems safely and conveniently anytime, anywhere, and adopted proactive network defense measures to detect and prevent attackers. Additionally, the Company has identified potential risks from a hacker’s perspective, conducted external red team Business Continuity Management Framework TSMC’s business continuity management (BCM) framework guides the Company in responding effectively and promptly to business disruption, which safeguards the interests of the Company and its stakeholders. The BCM framework outlines the governance structure, processes and capabilities supported by a resilient culture in fortifying the Company’s operational resilience.Fortifying Operational ResilienceSafeguard – People, Technology, Information, Physical ResourceResilient CultureBCM Policy & ProceduresBCM Steering CommitteeBCM Executive CouncilBCM TaskforcesAnalysis• Risk & Threat   Assessment• Business Impact   AnalysisDesign• BC Objectives• Infrastructure   Design• Preventions / MitigationsValidation• Exercise / Testing• Lessons LearnedReview• Program Performance    Monitoring & Management• Management Review• Continuous ImprovementImplementation• Training and Awareness• BC Plans Development & Implementation• CommunicationsEmergency ResponseCrisis ManagementCyber ResilienceBusiness Continuity & RecoveryTechnology & Data ResilienceSupply Chain ResilienceBCMGovernanceBCMProcessCoreCapabilities強化營運韌性保護－人員、技術、資訊、實體資源營運持續管理政策與程序營運持續管理指導委員會營運持續管理執行委員會營運持續管理工作小組分析‧風險與威脅分析‧營運衝擊分析設計‧營運持續目標‧基礎設施設計‧預防與控制驗證‧事件學習審查‧系統績效監測與管理‧管理審查‧持續改善執行‧訓練與意識活動‧制定並執行營運持    續計畫‧溝通營運持續治理營運持續管理流程核心能力性韌化文緊急應變危機處理網路韌性供應鏈韌性營運持續與復原技術與資訊韌性Business Continuity Management Framework134135(cyberattack simulation) testing, and continually assessed its security posture. TSMC has implemented application quality measures, enhanced the security and efficiency of the software development process, and introduced new technologies to strengthen data protection, ensuring that the protection of TSMC’s critical data complies with international standards and improving overall employee security awareness.To reduce supply chain risks, TSMC collaborates with key suppliers to assist them in improving their information security maturity. In 2024, TSMC organized a cybersecurity workshop for suppliers, sharing network security defense solutions and practices. Nearly 800 participants from close to 500 suppliers attended the workshop, which received high recognition from the suppliers. This effort not only enhanced the security capabilities of the suppliers but also strengthened the trust and communication between TSMC and its suppliers, thereby promoting the information security resilience of the entire supply chain. In 2024, TSMC further signed the MOU, memorandum of cybersecurity cooperation with the National Institute of Cyber Security. The two parties will enhance information security professional capabilities and protection capabilities through joint information security defense, and deepen industrial supply chain information security management and protection. TSMC continues to strengthen its own and supply chain information security and fulfill its corporate social responsibilities. Starting from 2021, TSMC has won the TCSA Taiwan Corporate Sustainability Award – Information Security Leadership Award for four consecutive years.In addition, TSMC employs certain third-party service providers for the Company and its affiliates worldwide with whom it needs to share highly sensitive and confidential information to enable them to provide the relevant services. While TSMC requires such third-party service providers to strictly fulfill the confidentiality and/or internet security requirements in its service agreements with them, there is no assurance that each of them will comply with such obligations. Moreover, such third-party service providers may also be susceptible to cyberattacks. If TSMC or its service providers are not able to timely resolve the respective technical difficulties caused by such cyberattacks, or ensure the integrity and availability of its data (and data belonging to its customers and other third parties) or maintain control of its or its service providers’ computing systems, the Company’s commitments to its customers and other stakeholders may be materially impaired and its results of operations, financial condition, prospects and reputation may also be materially and adversely affected.Risks Associated with Decrease in Demand and Average Selling PriceA vast majority of the Company’s revenue is derived from customers who use TSMC products in HPC (including AI applications), smartphones, IoT, automotive, and digital consumer electronics. Any deterioration in or a slowdown in the growth of such end markets resulting in a substantial decrease in the demand for overall global semiconductor foundry services, including TSMC products and services, could adversely affect the Company’s revenue. Further, semiconductor manufacturing facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed cost assets once they are in operation. Because TSMC owns most of its manufacturing capacities, a significant portion of its operating costs is fixed. In general, these costs do not decline when customer demand or its capacity utilization rates drop, and thus declines in customer demand, among other factors, may significantly decrease the Company’s margins. Conversely, as product demand rises and factory utilization increases, the fixed costs are spread over increased output, which can improve the Company’s margins. In addition, the historical trend of declining average selling prices (ASP) of end-use applications places downward pressure on the prices of the components that go into such applications. Decreases in the ASP of end-use applications may increase pricing pressure on components produced by TSMC, which, in turn, may negatively impact its revenue, margin and earnings.Risks Associated with CompetitionThe competition in the semiconductor foundry segment is fierce. TSMC competes with other foundry service providers, as well as a number of integrated device manufacturers. Some of these companies may have access to more advanced or different technologies than the Company. Other companies may have greater financial and other resources than the Company, such as the possibility of receiving direct or indirect government subsidies, economic stimulus funds, or other incentives that may be unavailable to TSMC. The governments of the United States, China, Europe, South Korea and Japan provide various incentive programs to promote developments of their domestic semiconductor industries, such as the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act of 2022 (the U.S. CHIPS Act), which provides financial incentives to incentivize the development of U.S. semiconductor industry. In November 2024, TSMC Arizona Corporation (“TSMC Arizona”) entered into agreements with the U.S. Department of Commerce for the receipt of certain incentives pursuant to the U.S. CHIPS Act, which includes up to US$6.6 billion in total direct funding and up to US$5 billion of proposed loans. In December 2024, European Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (ESMC) GmbH (“ESMC”), TSMC’s subsidiary in Germany, entered into an agreement with the Federal Republic of Germany for the receipt of up to EUR5 billion state aid under the European Chips Act (Regulation (EU) 2023/1781). Although governments in certain of the countries or regions where TSMC is currently expanding or planning to expand its production capacity have extended or may in the future extend certain financial incentives to the Company, there is no assurance that TSMC will be able to receive such financial incentives, including pursuant to the U.S. CHIPS Act, at the levels the Company anticipate or at all. Additionally, any financial incentives the Company receives may be subject to conditions and requirements imposed by the grantors, such as restrictions on the expansion of facilities in foreign countries of concern and on joint research and technology licensing efforts with foreign entities of concern on any technology or product that raises national security concerns. Noncompliance with the terms and conditions of the grants that the Company may receive could result in a delay or forfeiture of all or a portion of any future amounts to be received, as well as obligate us to repay all or a portion of amounts already received pursuant to the grants. Even if the Company satisfies the conditions and requirements for the funding disbursement, it is possible that the grantor may delay the disbursement or be unable to provide the funding. While the Company expects to continue benefiting from government incentives, failure to obtain grants that the Company seeks, to fully utilize available grants, or to comply with the terms and conditions of grants, could impact the Company’s ability to achieve its goals for the projects that would otherwise benefit from grant funding and could has an adverse effect on its business, results of operations, and financial condition.Moreover, the Company’s competitors may, from time to time, also decide to undertake aggressive pricing initiatives in one or several technology nodes. The Company’s competitors may also compete for its customers who seek to diversify their supply chains. These competitive activities may decrease TSMC’s customer base, its pricing, or both. If the Company is unable to compete effectively with such competitors on technology, manufacturing capacity, product quality, supply chain diversification and resilience, and customer satisfaction, it risks losing customers or business to such contenders.Risks Associated with Changes in the Government Policies and Regulatory EnvironmentTSMC management closely monitors all domestic and foreign governmental policies and regulations that might impact TSMC’s business and financial operations. During 2024 and as of the date of this Annual Report, the following changes or developments in governmental policies and regulations may influence the Company’s business operations:The manufacturing, assembling and testing of TSMC’s products require the use of chemicals and materials that are subject to environmental, climate related, health and safety laws and regulations issued worldwide as well as international accords such as the Paris Agreement. The Climate Change Response Act of the R.O.C., effective since 2015 and amended in February 2023, set a goal of reaching net-zero emissions in Taiwan by 2050 and established a carbon fee system to collect carbon fee. For emitters with direct and indirect emissions exceeding a certain threshold, carbon fees will be levied starting from 2025. As TSMC’s emissions from each fab in Taiwan exceed the current regulatory threshold, we will start to pay carbon fees from 2026 (for the 2025 fees), which will result in increased operating costs for us. Also, the R.O.C. legislative authority is regularly reviewing various environmental issues to develop laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and climate changes. The impact of such laws and regulations is currently indeterminable.It is not expected that other governmental policies or regulatory changes would materially impact TSMC’s operations or financial condition.6.2.3 Operational RisksNatural and Man-Made DisasterTSMC is committed to maintaining operational resilience in accordance with business continuity management standards that equips it with the capability to respond effectively to business disruption. Disruptions caused by natural and man-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, sandstorms, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, fire, gas/chemical leakage or spill, pandemic, cyberattacks, supply chain disruption, geopolitical tensions, sabotage, terrorism, failure of critical facilities and equipment, disruptions in utilities, such as water, electricity and natural gas, etc., could interrupt our operations.136137Most of TSMC’s production facilities, as well as those of many of its suppliers, customers and upstream providers of complementary semiconductor manufacturing services, are located in areas susceptible to natural disasters and may face potential shortages of electricity and/or water, which could cause interruptions to TSMC’s operations. In April 2024 and January 2025, several earthquakes struck Taiwan, causing damage to our inventories, plant facilities, machinery and equipment. We recognized approximately NT$3 billion and NT$5.3 billion in losses from earthquakes, net of insurance claim, respectively, in the second quarter of 2024 and the first quarter of 2025.If one or more natural disasters result in a prolonged disruption to TSMC’s operations or those of its customers or suppliers, or if any of its fabs or vendor facilities were to be damaged or cease operations as a result of an unforeseen disruptive event, it could reduce TSMC’s manufacturing capacity and cause the loss of important customers and thereby have an adverse, material impact on its operational and financial performance.To cope with possible droughts resulted from severe climate change, TSMC implemented manufacturing process water saving, as well as building up industrial water recycling plants, using household water and cooperating with government to mitigate water shortage risk. As part of TSMC’s business continuity plans, measures taken include water conservation measures, use of alternative water sources. Close monitoring of water situation including stress testing and exercises are carried out to validate our response plan.TSMC has occasionally suffered power outages, dips or surges caused by difficulties encountered by its electricity supplier or other power consumers on the same power grid. Some of these incidents have resulted in interruptions to TSMC’s operations. Such outages, shortages or interruptions in electricity supply could further be exacerbated by changes in the energy policy of the governments. If TSMC is unable to secure reliable and uninterrupted supply of electricity to power its manufacturing fabs, its ability to fill customers’ orders would be jeopardized. Moreover, TSMC has encountered and may continue to encounter increases in the prices of utilities. For example, effective from April 1, 2024, TSMC is subject to a higher electricity tariff rate in Taiwan, which is estimated to increase by 25%, as compared to the tariff rate applicable to the Company in 2023. The increased prices for electricity could increase TSMC’s manufacturing costs and therefore adversely impact TSMC’s financial results. In addition, due to climate change, severe weather events, such as droughts, and any measures taken by governments in response to such severe weather events may materially affect TSMC’s operations and its suppliers’ production. For example, the measures taken by governments in response to droughts, including water rationing and conservation, may cause interruption to TSMC’s operations or its expansion plans.If such events were to occur over prolonged periods of time, TSMC’s operations and financial performance may be materially adversely affected. Moreover, TSMC’s future capacity expansions in Taiwan and elsewhere could be curtailed by utility shortages.TSMC has further strengthened its business continuity management, which includes periodic risk assessments and mitigations, implementing centralized scenario planning for business continuity management exercises, and the establishment of taskforces. The taskforces define emergency response, crisis communication, recovery plans and preventative measures based on the thorough analysis of derivative effects and alternative solutions to ensure the impacts to lives, business operations and assets are minimized. TSMC reviews periodically its business continuity plans and refines them to reflect exercise results and implementation. In response to the impact of the earthquakes that occurs in Taiwan and Japan, TSMC continues to improve its earthquake emergency response, tool anchorage and seismic isolation facilities, and readiness for tool salvage and production recovery. These improvements have been integrated into new fab design and processes.TSMC maintains a comprehensive risk management system dedicated to human safety, the conservation of natural resources and the protection of property. In order to cope effectively with emergencies and natural disasters, management at each facility has developed comprehensive plans and procedures that focus on risk prevention, emergency response, crisis management and business continuity. All TSMC manufacturing fabs have been ISO 14001 certified (environmental management) and ISO 45001 certified (occupational health and safety management). All manufacturing fabs in Taiwan have also been TOSHMS (Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System) certified. New fabs will also attain the above certifications within 18 months after acquiring factory registration certification.TSMC and many of its suppliers use flammable and toxic materials in their manufacturing processes and are therefore subject to risks that cannot be completely eliminated arising from explosion, fire, or environmental influences. Although TSMC maintains multiple layers of risk prevention and protection, as well as fire and casualty insurance, TSMC’s risk management and insurance coverage may not always be sufficient to cover all of its potential losses. If any of TSMC’s fabs or vendor facilities were to be damaged or cease operations as a result of an explosion, fire or environmental causes, it could reduce the TSMC’s manufacturing capacity leading to the loss of important sales and customers and have a negative impact on TSMC’s financial performance.TSMC continues to monitor key disruptive threats to its business operations and adapt the plans to ensure operational resilience.Risks Associated with Capacity ExpansionTSMC performs long-term market demand forecasts on a regular basis for its products and services to manage its overall capacity. Based on market demand, the Company has continued to add capacity to meet market needs for its products and services, including in Taiwan, in Arizona, U.S., in Kumamoto, Japan and in Dresden, Germany.Implementing these capacity expansion plans will increase its costs, and the increases may be substantial. For example, the Company would need to build new facilities, purchase additional equipment and hire and train personnel to operate the new equipment. If TSMC does not increase its net revenue accordingly, its financial performance may be adversely affected by these increased costs.In addition, market conditions are dynamic, and TSMC’s market demand forecasts may change significantly at any time. During periods of decreased demand, certain manufacturing lines or tools in some of the Company’s manufacturing facilities may be suspended or shut down temporarily. However, if demand subsequently increases rapidly over a short period of time, TSMC may not be able to restore the capacity in a timely manner to take advantage of the upturn. In such circumstances, its financial performance and competitiveness may be adversely affected.In order to mitigate the risk associated with capacity expansion, TSMC continuously watches for changes in market conditions and works closely with its customers. When market demand is not as expected, the Company tries to adjust its capacity plans in a timely manner to reduce the impact on its financial performance.Risks Associated with Construction of New FabsThe Company has multiple expansion projects that are currently underway, including the design and construction of new fabs worldwide. Global expansion has required and will continue to require considerable managerial, financial and other resources. The Company expects to face particular challenges in global expansion and operations, including but not limited to:●higher costs associated with construction of new fabs, establishing supply chains for various materials in different overseas locations, the impact on the Company’s ability to sustain its current level of productivity and manufacturing efficiency provided by its ecosystem of interconnected semiconductor fabs, employees and suppliers in the R.O.C., and recruiting and retaining talent in various overseas locations;●labor shortages, interruptions in the supply chains for various materials, and construction issues, which could substantially delay the completion of the Company’s expansion projects, and could further result in substantial additional costs or failure to meet its capacity expansion plans; ●disruptions to the Company’s operations caused by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, sandstorms, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, fire, gas/chemical leakage or spill, pandemic, cyberattacks, supply chain disruption, geopolitical tensions, labor issues, sabotage, failure of critical facilities and equipment and disruptions in utilities, such as water, electricity and natural gas, etc.;●scarcity of industrial-use land, which could limit the Company’s future expansion of operations; ●compliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations, and the risk of penalties if the Company’s practices are deemed not to be in compliance;●challenges in managing information technology infrastructure in multiple locations and across different systems and risks of our information technology infrastructure succumbing to cyberattacks worldwide;●adverse changes relating to government grants or other government incentives, including non-receipt, delay and potential claw backs of government subsidies;●challenges in creating an inclusive workplace in new sites to embrace the cultural differences and managing the operation over large geographic distances and in context of different employment practices and labor laws and regulations;●limited or insufficient intellectual property protection or difficulties enforcing the Company’s rights to intellectual property; and●exposure to different tax jurisdictions and potential adverse tax consequences.138139If TSMC is unable to overcome the above challenges, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Risks Associated with Sales ConcentrationOver the years, the Company’s customer profile and the nature of the Company’s customers’ business have changed dramatically. While TSMC generates revenue from hundreds of customers worldwide, TSMC’s ten largest customers in 2022, 2023 and 2024 accounted for approximately, 68%, 70% and 76% of TSMC’s net revenue in the respective year. TSMC’s largest customer in 2022, 2023 and 2024 accounted for 23%, 25% and 22% of the Company’s net revenue in the respective year. TSMC’s second largest customer in 2022, 2023 and 2024 accounted for less than 10%, 11% and 12% of TSMC’s net revenue in the respective year.A more concentrated customer base will subject TSMC’s revenue to seasonal demand fluctuations from the Company’s large customers, and cause different seasonal patterns in the Company’s business. This customer concentration results in part from the changing dynamics of the electronics industry with the structural shift to mobile and HPC devices and applications and software that provide the content for such devices.There are only a limited number of customers who are successfully exploiting this new business model paradigm. Also, TSMC has seen changes in the nature of its customers’ business models in response to this new business model paradigm. For example, there is a growing trend among system companies designing their own semiconductors and working directly with the semiconductor foundries, which makes their products and services more marketable in a changing consumer market. These shifting business models could lead to significant variations in our sales if the growth of their products and services, particularly in the AI sector, is volatile or not sustainable.Also, since the global semiconductor industry has become increasingly competitive, some of TSMC’s customers have engaged in industry consolidations in order to remain competitive. Such consolidations have taken the form of mergers and acquisitions. If more of TSMC’s major customers consolidate, this will further decrease the overall number of the Company’s customer pool. In addition, regulatory restrictions, such as export controls directed at TSMC’s major customers, could impact the Company’s ability to supply products to those customers or reduce those customers’ demand for TSMC’s products and services and thus impact their business operations.The loss of, or significant curtailment of purchases by, one or more of the Company’s top customers including curtailments due to increased competitive pressures, industry consolidation, changes in applicable regulatory restrictions, product designs, manufacturing sourcing or outsourcing policies or practices of these customers, the timing of customer inventory adjustments, or changes in its major customers’ business models, may adversely affect TSMC’s results of operations and financial condition.Risks Associated with Purchasing Concentration●Raw MaterialsTSMC’s production operations require that it obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, such as silicon wafers, gases, chemicals and photoresist, on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices. In the past, shortages in the supply of some materials, whether by specific suppliers or by the semiconductor industry generally, have resulted in occasional industry-wide price adjustments and delivery delays. Moreover, major natural disasters, trade barriers and political or economic turmoil, including military conflicts and inflation, occurring within the country of origin of such raw materials may also significantly disrupt the availability of such raw materials or increase their prices. Also, since TSMC procures some of its raw materials from sole-sourced suppliers, there is a risk that the Company’s needs for such raw materials may not be met or that back-up supplies may not be readily available. Importation and domestic production limitations may also restrict the Company’s ability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials as well as materials of the necessary quality. In addition, recent trade tensions could result in increased prices or even unavailability of raw materials due to tariffs, export control or other non-tariff barriers. TSMC’s revenue and earnings could be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of the necessary raw materials in a timely manner or if there are significant increases in the costs of raw materials. To reduce the supply chain risk and to manage costs effectively, TSMC commits resources toward developing new supply sources and developing a future capacity plan with qualified raw material suppliers. Furthermore, the Company continually encourages its suppliers to reduce their supply chain risk by decentralizing production plants to improve their cost competitiveness and to support TSMC global demands in a timely fashion.TSMC not only operates world-class manufacturing process and facilities but needs sufficient world-class high-quality raw materials. As a result, TSMC engages early and extensively with primary suppliers on managing quality and capacity issues so as to be prepared for any unexpected need to ramp up or curtail production. To streamline supply chain risk, the Company communicates early on with major material suppliers regarding quality and capacity topics and has formed a dedicated team for supplier plant onsite or remote audits to extend supply chain best practices to its upstream suppliers. In addition, in response to the rapid increase or decrease in production capacity of new products, TSMC has continued to improve its inventory monitoring system to achieve more accurate demand forecasts and ensure that the supply chain maintains sufficient inventory levels. The Company also performs supply chain risk assessments to ensure that critical suppliers meet various standards in labor, ethics, environmental, safety and health (ESH) practices and business continuity plans (BCPs).●EquipmentThe Company’s operations and ongoing expansion plans depend on its ability to obtain necessary equipment and related services available from a limited number of suppliers. As a result, TSMC may encounter the situation of limited supply and/or long delivery cycles. To better manage its supply chain, the Company evaluates and projects delivery lead times to minimize the impact of supply chain risks on operating costs. TSMC has also implemented various collaborative business models and risk management contingencies with suppliers to ensure supply and shorten the procurement lead time. To enhance its sourcing capabilities for its global sites, the company has also taken steps to strengthen its understanding of local regulations, policies, and supply chains. However, if TSMC is unable to acquire in a timely manner the equipment and parts it needs, it may fail to successfully implement capacity expansion plans and exploit time sensitive business opportunities. Additionally, ongoing trade tensions could result in increased prices for, or even unavailability of, key equipment, through delay or denial of necessary export licenses, adoption of additional export control measures and other tariff or non-tariff barriers. If TSMC is unable to obtain equipment in a timely fashion to fulfill its customers’ demand for technology and production capacity, or unable to do so at a reasonable cost, its financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.Risks Associated with Intellectual Property RightsThe Company’s ability to compete successfully and to achieve future growth depends in part on the continued strength of its intellectual property portfolio. While the Company actively enforces and protects its intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that its efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of its proprietary technologies, software, trade secrets or know-how. Also, the Company cannot assure you that, as its business or business models expand into new areas, it will be able to develop independently the technologies, patents, software, trade secrets or know-how necessary to conduct its business or that it can do so without unknowingly infringing the intellectual property rights of others. As a result, the Company may has to rely on, to a certain degree, licensed technologies and patent licenses from others. To the extent that the Company relies on licenses from others, there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain any or all of the necessary licenses in the future on terms it considers reasonable or at all. The lack of necessary licenses could expose the Company to claims for damages and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by its customers in instances where it has contractually agreed to indemnify its customers against damages resulting from infringement claims.The Company has received, from time to time, communications from third parties, including non-practicing entities and semiconductor companies, asserting that TSMC’s technologies, its manufacturing processes, or the design IPs of the semiconductors made by TSMC or the use of those semiconductors by its customers may infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. Because of the nature of the industry, its market position, and the expansion of its manufacturing operations outside of Taiwan, the Company may receive an increased number of such communications in the future. The assertions made and lawsuits initiated by litigious, well-funded, non-practicing entities are particularly aggressive in their monetary demand and in seeking court-issued injunctions. Such lawsuits and assertions may increase TSMC’s cost of doing business and may potentially be extremely disruptive if these asserting entities succeed in blocking the trade of products made and services offered by TSMC. Also, with the expansion of its manufacturing operations into certain non-R.O.C. jurisdictions, it has faced increased challenges in managing risks of intellectual property misappropriation. Despite our efforts to adopt robust measures to mitigate the risk of intellectual property misappropriation 140141in such new jurisdictions, we cannot guarantee that the protection measures we adopted will be sufficient to prevent us from potential infringements by others, or at all.If the Company fails to obtain or maintain certain technologies or intellectual property licenses or fails to prevent our intellectual property from being misappropriated and, if litigation relating to alleged intellectual property matters occurs, it could: (1) prevent the Company from manufacturing particular products or selling particular services or applying particular technologies; and (2) reduce our ability to compete effectively against entities benefiting from our misappropriated intellectual property, which could reduce its opportunities to generate revenue.The Company has taken related measures to minimize potential loss of shareholder value arising from intellectual property claims and litigation filed against it. These measures include: strategically obtaining licenses from certain semiconductor and other technology companies as needed; timely securing intellectual property rights originating within and outside of TSMC for defensive and/or offensive protection of TSMC technology and business; and aggressively defending against baseless litigation.Risks Associated with Litigious and Non-litigious MattersAs is the case with many companies in the semiconductor industry, the Company has received from time to time communications from third parties asserting that its technologies, its manufacturing processes, or the design of the semiconductors made by TSMC or the use of those semiconductors by its customers may infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights. These assertions have at times resulted in litigation by or against the Company and settlement payments by the Company. Irrespective of the validity of these claims, the Company could incur significant costs in the defense thereof or could suffer adverse effects on its operations. The Company is also subject to antitrust compliance requirements and scrutiny by governmental regulators in multiple jurisdictions. Any adverse results of such proceeding or other similar proceedings that may arise in those jurisdictions could harm TSMC’s business and distract its management, and thereby have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or prospects, and subject the Company to potential significant legal liability.Currently, TSMC’s material legal proceeding is as follows:In February 2025, Longitude Licensing Ltd. and Marlin Semiconductor Limited (collectively, “Marlin”) filed complaints with the U.S. International Trade Commission (“ITC”) and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that TSMC and its customers infringe five U.S. patents. The ITC instituted an investigation on March 21, 2025. The outcome cannot be determined, and we cannot make a reliable estimate of the contingent liability at this time.Other than the matter described above, as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC is not currently a party to any other material legal proceedings.Risks Associated with Mergers and AcquisitionsIn 2024 and as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC had not conducted any merger or acquisition.Risks Associated with Talent RecruitmentTSMC relies on the continued services and contributions of its management team, as well as skilled technical and professional personnel. The Company’s business could suffer from the inability to fulfill personnel needs with high quality professionals in a timely fashion caused by the loss of personnel, talent shortages, illegal talent poaching, immigration controls, or related changes in market demand for our products and services. Since there is fierce competition for talent recruitment, the Company cannot ensure timely fulfillment of its personnel demand.In order to reduce the risk of talent shortage, TSMC encourages job rotation and employs an on-the-job training and certification system. In this way, employees can continuously learn and enhance their work efficiency and effectiveness in the workplace. Moreover, TSMC creates multiple recruitment channels and continues to hire diverse top-notch, talented professionals from Taiwan and overseas. At the same time, the Company continues to expand industry-academic cooperation to meet outstanding talent at an early phase to recruit them in the future.Future R&D Plans and Expected R&D SpendingFor additional details, see “5.2.7 Future R&D Plans” on page 105 of this Annual Report.Changes in Corporate Reputation and Impact on the Company’s Crisis ManagementTSMC has established an excellent reputation worldwide based on its core values of integrity, commitment, innovation and customer trust. The Company’s positive image also reflects outstanding operations, rigorous corporate governance and dedication to sustainable responsibility by serving as a good corporate citizen. TSMC continues to pursue innovation in economic, environmental and social dimensions.In 2024, TSMC was honored with numerous awards and citations for achievements in various areas including operations, corporate governance, patents, profit growth, investor relations, environmental protection, and corporate sustainability. The Company was selected as a part of the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the 24th consecutive year. TSMC won first place in CommonWealth magazine’s Talent Sustainability award for the second year in a row and also received the Taiwan Institute for Sustainable Energy’s Corporate Sustainability award for 2024. The Company earned top honors for the Taiwan Top Ten Sustainability Exemplary, as well as awards for Corporate Sustainability Report, climate leadership, circular economy leadership, supply chain management, sustainable water management and information security leadership. In addition, The S&P Global ranked TSMC in the top ten percent of its Sustainability Yearbook Award for 2024. The Company also ranked in the top five percent of the Taiwan Stock Exchange corporate governance evaluation. The Company was named a member of Fortune’s 2024 World’s Most Admired Companies and the Fortune Global 500 and was rated as “Prime” by ISS ESG Corporate Rating; TSMC was a member of PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Global Top 100 Companies by market capitalization and a member of the 2024 Carbon Clean 200TM list issued by the media research company Corporate Knights and the non-profit As You Sow organization. The Company was also honored as part of the World Benchmarking Alliance’s SDG2000, the 2,000 Most Influential Companies, and in Morgan Stanley Capital International’s All Country World Index ESG Leaders, while being ranked AAA by MSCI Research in its ESG Indexes.To promote sustainability, TSMC’s ESG Steering Committee, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dr. C.C. Wei, presented the fifth TSMC ESG Award in 2024, honoring internal organizations and divisions for tangible achievements in the Company’s five ESG strategic directions: drive green manufacturing, build a responsible supply chain, create a healthy and inclusive workplace, develop talent, and care for the disadvantaged. At the same time, this award presentation encouraged all employees to propose new ideas for sustainability to be assessed for feasibility and potential incorporation in the Company’s implementation plans. Compared to 3,166 sustainability proposals in the fourth year, the fifth annual ESG Award generated 4,330 innovative ideas, adding new energy to the Company’s culture of sustainability.TSMC is committed to maintaining operational resilience and business continuity by following standards that enable the Company to respond effectively to major risks of natural and man-made disasters, including earthquakes, floods, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, sandstorms, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, fire, gas/chemical leaks or spills, pandemics, cyber-attacks, supply chain disruption, geopolitical tension, sabotage, failure of critical facilities and equipment, and shortages in utilities such as water, electricity and natural gas. TSMC also implements pre-crisis risk assessment, response procedures and recovery plans. In major incidents or crisis events, TSMC adheres to established crisis management guidelines. The central crisis command center (C4), led by the Chairman and CEO and consisting of senior executives from key functions, provides guidance and decision-making to ensure response readiness, including timely communication with key stakeholders. In 2024, TSMC received a rating of Low ESG Risk from Sustainalytics ESG Risk Ratings.TSMC’s environment, safety and health committee holds monthly meetings to coordinate with relevant departments in each fab to conduct emergency response drills and continuously improve their notification and operational procedures. This ensures clear channels of communication to stakeholders in case a crisis arises, with the public relations division serving as the designated gateway for external communications.TSMC has further strengthened its business continuity management, which includes periodic risk assessments and mitigations, implementing centralized scenario planning for business continuity management exercises, and the establishment of task forces. TSMC has also deepened the risk management mechanisms of its overseas subsidiaries and offices by conducting risk management and business continuity management workshops and incident commander training. These efforts aim to fortify operational resilience and raise risk awareness of operational preparedness across TSMC’s global footprint.If the aforementioned crisis occurs, relevant personnel at TSMC’s headquarters and global operating locations can deploy comprehensive emergency response measures to eliminate or minimize the impact on personnel safety, environment, property and operations. Responders also involve 142143the public relations division from the initial stage to ensure timely, clear, and consistent external communication regarding the situation.Risks Associated with Change in ManagementIn 2024 and as of the date of this Annual Report, there were no such risks for TSMC.Risks Regarding Non-Compliance with Export Control, Environmental and Climate Change Related Laws, Regulations and Accords, and Failure to Timely Obtain Requisite Approvals Necessary for Conducting BusinessBecause TSMC engages in manufacturing activities in multiple jurisdictions and conducts business with its customers located worldwide, such activities are subject to a myriad of governmental regulations. For example, the manufacturing, assembling and testing of TSMC’s products require the use of equipment that is subject to export control laws and regulations, as well as metals, chemicals, and materials that are subject to environmental, climate-related, health and safety, and humanitarian forced labor prohibition and conflict-free sourcing laws, regulations and guidelines issued worldwide. The Company’s failure to comply with any such laws or regulations, as amended from time to time, and its failure to comply with any information and document sharing requests from the relevant authorities in a timely manner could result in:●significant penalties and legal liabilities, such as the denial of import or export permits or third party private lawsuits, criminal or administrative proceedings; ●the temporary or permanent suspension of production of the affected products; ●the temporary or permanent inability to procure or use certain production critical chemicals or materials;●unfavorable alterations in TSMC’s manufacturing, fabrication and assembly and test processes; ●challenges from its customers that place TSMC at a significant competitive disadvantage, such as loss of actual or potential sales contracts in case the Company is unable to satisfy the applicable legal standard or customer requirement; ●restrictions on TSMC’s operations or sales; ●loss of tax benefits, including termination of current tax incentives, disqualification of tax credit application and repayment of the tax benefits that the Company is not entitled to; and●damages to TSMC’s goodwill and reputation.TSMC’s role in the semiconductor supply chain inherently limits its visibility and information available to it regarding the downstream use or user of final products that incorporate semiconductors manufactured by it. This constraint impedes TSMC’s ability to fully ensure that semiconductors manufactured by it will not be diverted to unintended end use or end-user, including potentially by its business partners, or by third parties with an intent of circumvention. In addition, if TSMC or TSMC’s business partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits or are found to have violated applicable export control or sanctions laws, TSMC may also be adversely affected, through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences, including government investigations and penalties resulting from relevant legal proceedings, as described in the above paragraph. In October 2024, TSMC notified relevant U.S. and Taiwan authorities that one type of its customer’s chip manufactured by it might have been diverted to a restricted entity or incorporated into a restricted entity’s product, and since then has been cooperating with the authorities’ requests for additional information and documents. Despite TSMC’s best efforts to comply with all relevant export control and sanctions laws and regulations, there is no assurance that its business activities will not be found incompliant with export control laws and regulations.Complying with applicable laws and regulations, such as environmental and climate related laws and regulations, could also require TSMC, among other things, to do the following: (1) purchase, use or install remedial equipment; (2) implement remedial programs such as climate change mitigation programs and air pollution reduction plans; (3) modify its product designs and manufacturing processes, or incur other significant expenses such as paying any incurred carbon fees if the Company’s emission levels exceed applicable thresholds, and obtaining renewable energy sources, renewable energy certificates or carbon credits, substitute raw materials or chemicals that may cost more or be less available for the Company’s operations.TSMC’s inability to timely obtain approvals necessary for the conduct of its business could impair its operational and financial results. For example, if the Company is unable to timely obtain environmental related approvals needed to undertake the development and construction of a new fab or expansion project, then such inability may delay, limit, or increase the cost of its expansion plans that could also in turn adversely affect its business and operational results. In light of increased public interest in environmental issues, TSMC’s operations and expansion plans may be adversely affected or delayed in response to public concern and social environmental pressures even if the Company complies with all applicable laws and regulations.TSMC believes that climate change should be regarded as a significant corporate risk that must be managed to improve competitiveness. For TSMC’s climate change related risks and control measures, see the Climate Change and Energy Management section under “7.2.1 Environmental Protection” on page 154-155 of this Annual Report.6.2.4 Financial RisksEconomic RisksAny future systemic political, economic or financial crisis or market volatility, including but not limited to interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, inflation or deflation or changes in economic, fiscal and monetary policies in major economies, could cause revenue or profits for the semiconductor industry as a whole to decline dramatically. If the economic conditions or financial conditions of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, the demand for its products and services may decrease and additional accounting related allowances may be required, which could reduce TSMC’s operating income and net income.●Interest Rate FluctuationTSMC is exposed to interest rate risks primarily in relation to its investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and fixed income securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as the interest paid on its debt.The objective of TSMC’s investment policy is to achieve a return that will allow the Company to preserve principal and support liquidity requirements. The policy generally requires the Company to invest in investment grade securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The majority of TSMC’s fixed income investments are fixed-rate securities, which are classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) or amortized cost. For those fixed income investments classified as financial assets at FVTOCI, changes in their fair value are recognized through other comprehensive income; for those classified as financial assets at amortized cost, changes in their fair value are not reflected in asset values unless the assets are sold.The majority of TSMC’s debt is fixed-rate and measured at amortized cost and, as such, changes in interest rates would not affect future cash flows or the carrying amount.TSMC has entered and may in the future enter into interest rate derivatives to partially hedge interest rate risk on its fixed income investments and anticipated debt issuance. However, these hedges can offset only a limited portion of the financial impact from movements in interest rates.●Foreign Exchange VolatilitySubstantially all of TSMC’s sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and over half of its capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than the NT dollar, primarily in U.S. dollars, Euros and Japanese yen. As a result, any significant fluctuations to its disadvantage in the exchange rate of the NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on the Company’s revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollars. For example, every one percent depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar would result in an approximately 0.4 percentage point decrease in the Company’s operating margin based on its 2024 results.Conversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly versus other major currencies, the demand for the products and services of TSMC’s customers and for its goods and services will likely decrease, which will negatively affect the Company’s revenue. TSMC uses foreign currency derivatives contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, and non-derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency denominated debts, to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-NT dollar-denominated monetary assets and liabilities, net investments in foreign operations, and certain forecasted transactions. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on its assets and liabilities.Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the NT dollar may affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s common shares and the market price of the Company’s American Depositary Shares (ADSs) as well as any cash dividends paid in NT dollars on TSMC’s common shares represented by ADSs.●InflationTSMC is subject to the effects of inflation through increases in the cost of items such as raw materials and equipment used to produce its products, wage expenses and employee benefits, electricity costs, and costs in relation to construction of fabs. Although TSMC does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations to date, a high inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to maintain current levels of profit margin if the selling prices of its products and services do not increase with these increased costs.144145●Amendments to Tax Regulations or Implementation of New Tax LawsAny amendments to existing tax regulations or the implementation of any new tax laws in the jurisdictions in which TSMC operates its business may have an adverse effect on its net income.While the Company is subject to tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which it operates or conducts business, TSMC’s principal operations are in the R.O.C. and it is exposed primarily to taxes levied by the R.O.C. government. Any unfavorable changes of tax laws and regulations in these jurisdictions could increase TSMC’s effective tax rate and adversely affect its operating results. Further, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”) project that was undertaken by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). These changes may increase tax uncertainty and have an adverse effect on TSMC’s operating results.In order to control tax risk, the Company closely monitors all domestic and foreign governmental policies and regulations that might impact its financial operations. TSMC has established risk management procedures to collect information, analyze potential tax implications, and develop countermeasures.Risks Associated with External FinancingIn addition, sufficient external financing may not be available to the Company on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms to the Company, or at all. If sufficient external financing is not available when TSMC needs such financing to meet its capital requirements, the Company may be forced to curtail its expansion, modify plans or delay the deployment of new or expanded services until it obtains such financing. In conclusion, any of these events, including any future global systemic crisis or further escalation of trade tensions as described above, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.Risks Associated with High-Risk/Highly Leveraged Investments; Lending, Endorsements, and Guarantees for Other Parties; and Financial Derivative TransactionsIn 2024 and as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC made no high-risk or highly leveraged financial investments. All financial derivative transactions engaged by TSMC were strictly for hedging and not for trading or speculative purposes. All guarantees and intercompany loans provided by TSMC and its subsidiaries were solely for TSMC and/or its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All guarantees and intercompany loans were in compliance with relevant rules and regulations.To manage risks of various financial transactions, TSMC has established internal control policies and procedures based on sound financial and business practices, all in compliance with the relevant rules and regulations issued by the R.O.C. Financial Supervisory Commission. TSMC’s policies and procedures include Procedures for Financial Derivatives Transactions, Procedures for Lending Funds to Other Parties, Procedures for Acquisition or Disposal of Assets, and Procedures for Endorsement and Guarantee.Risks Associated with Impairment ChargesUnder Taiwan-IFRSs, TSMC is required to evaluate its tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. If certain criteria are met, TSMC is required to record an impairment charge. TSMC is not able to estimate the extent or timing of any impairment charge for future years. Any impairment charge required may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s net income.The determination of an impairment charge at any given time is mainly based on the projected results of operations over several years subsequent to that time. Consequently, an impairment charge is more likely to occur during a period when the Company’s operating results are otherwise already depressed. In the process of evaluating the potential impairment of tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill, TSMC determines the independent cash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue and expenses related to the specific asset groups with the consideration of the nature of semiconductor industry. Any change in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in significant impairment charges or reversal in future years.6.2.5 Other RisksPotential Impact and Risks Associated with Sales of Significant Numbers of Shares by TSMC’s Directors, and/or Shareholders Who Own 10% or More of TSMC’s Total Outstanding SharesThe value of TSMC shareholders’ investment may be reduced by possible future sales of TSMC shares owned by major shareholders.As of the date of this Annual Report, no single shareholder owned 10% or more of TSMC’s total outstanding shares.Risks of Trade PoliciesAs TSMC’s revenue is primarily derived from sales to major economies in the world (please refer to “2.2.4 TSMC Position, Differentiation and Strategy” on page 17-19 of this Annual Report), any changes in the trade policies (such as the increase of tariffs on certain products, the implementation of import and export controls, and the adoption of other trade barriers) of such major economies can affect the sales of TSMC or its customers and thereby affect TSMC’s operating results. For example, U.S. President Donald Trump announced in 2025 an intention to impose more expansive tariffs on imports into the United States. Any tariffs imposed on imports of semiconductors and products incorporating chips into the United States may result in increased costs for purchasing such products, which may, in turn, lead to decreased demand for TSMC’s products and services and adversely affect its business and future growth.Also, any increase in the use of export control restrictions and sanctions to target certain countries and entities, any expansion of the extraterritorial jurisdiction of such measures, or complete or partial ban on semiconductor products sales to certain entities could impact not only TSMC’s ability to continue supplying products to those customers, but also our customers’ demand for our products, and could even lead to changes in semiconductor supply chains.For example, the U.S. tightened its export control measures against Huawei Technology Co. Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, “Huawei”) in 2020. To comply with relevant laws and regulations, TSMC has discontinued shipment of products to Huawei since September 2020. In October 2022 and October 2023, the U.S. adopted additional export controls (the “October Rules”) over specified countries (including China) under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“U.S. EAR”) on certain advanced computing integrated circuits (“ICs”), computer commodities that contain such ICs, and certain semiconductor manufacturing items, as well as controls on transactions involving items for supercomputer and semiconductor manufacturing end-uses. The controls impose license requirements for items subject to the U.S. EAR where the items are destined to a semiconductor fabrication facility in China that fabricates ICs meeting specified advanced node parameters as well as for U.S. persons’ activities supporting such facility or semiconductor manufacturing items. In response, TSMC obtained from the U.S. Department of Commerce a Validated End-User (the “VEU”) authorization for TSMC’s fab located in Nanjing, China, which is a permanent authorization that allows TSMC’s fab in Nanjing to receive exports of eligible items from the U.S. without separate licenses. However, there is no assurance that the VEU authorization TSMC obtained will not be terminated in the future. The restrictions imposed by the October Rules on advanced computing ICs are further reinforced by the U.S.’ new rules issued in January 2025. Under the new rules, TSMC may need to obtain an export license prior to shipping products using 16-nanometer or below process to any global destination unless specific conditions are met. As a result, shipments of certain products may be delayed or prohibited due to the license requirements and the Company’s financial results may be adversely affected.On the other hand, measures adopted by an affected country to counteract the impact of another country’s actions or regulations could lead to significant legal liability to multinational corporations including our own. For example, in January 2021, China adopted a blocking statute that, among other matters, entitles Chinese entities incurring damages from a multinational’s compliance with foreign laws to seek civil remedies.Imposition of trade barriers, including protectionist measures, sanctions and import and export controls (including without limitation the export control measures mentioned in the foregoing paragraph), could increase TSMC’s manufacturing costs, limit TSMC’s access to certain supplies, make TSMC’s pricing less competitive, and impact the sales of TSMC or its customers. In 2024 and as of the date of this Annual Report, the Company’s current results of operations have not been materially affected by the expanded export control regulations or the novel rules or measures adopted to counteract them. Nevertheless, depending on future developments in global trade tensions, such regulations, rules, or measures may have an adverse impact on the Company’s business and operations, and TSMC may incur significant legal liability and financial losses as a result.TSMC continues to monitor the recent shifts in trade policies and measures among the relevant major economies and will take corresponding responsive actions in accordance with subsequent developments.1461477TSMC is the only semiconductor company to be selected as a component of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for 24 consecutive years.Corporate Sustainability (ESG)1481497.1 OverviewIn pursuit of its core business achievements, TSMC remains committed to responsible management, guided by three key missions: Integrity, Strengthen Environmental Protection, and Care for the Underprivileged.

This committee, comprising senior executives from a wide variety of functions, collaboratively examines ESG issues critical to the Company’s operations and establishes short-, medium-, and long-term strategic directions and development goals, aligning with the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs), while leveraging the Company’s core strengths.The ESG Committee, operating under the guidance of the ESG Steering Committee’s resolutions, is responsible for integrating resources and coordinating communication across various departments. It oversees the dedicated ESG department (established in 2019 and renamed in 2021) and engages cross-organizational representatives to collaboratively identify sustainability issues pertinent to the Company’s operations and stakeholders’ interests. Task forces are established based on identified issues to develop corresponding strategies, goals, and action plans. Progress is monitored through quarterly meetings to ensure effective implementation of ESG strategies in TSMC’s daily operations. Additionally, the Chairperson of the ESG Committee provides quarterly updates on execution outcomes and future plans to the Board of Directors/Nominating, Corporate Governance, and Sustainability Committee. This ongoing communication aims to enhance TSMC’s sustainability management policies, strategies, and objectives, fostering sustainable development. In 2024, TSMC focused primarily on green manufacturing and supply chain management (including climate and nature risk/opportunity identification and actions, carbon and water footprint management, the Eco Plus! Ecological Harmony Program, and value chain decarbonization), inclusive workplaces and talent development (including conducting workplace human rights climate surveys and strengthening semiconductor industry-academia collaboration). Public welfare contributions (including Teach and Learn Program and Vocational Training Project,) alongside planning and executing ESG budgets for 2024 and 2025. TSMC employs sustainability reports as a tool for ESG management and has updated themed reports such as the Climate and Nature Report, the UN’s SDG Action Report, the Materiality Analysis Report, the Sustainability Impact Valuation Report, and the Human Rights Report.Stakeholder EngagementTSMC respects all stakeholders’ rights and interests in sustainability issues through diverse communication platforms.

For 26 consecutive years, TSMC has published its non-financial report. The Company conducts materiality analyses based on Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 3: Material Topics 2021, incorporating the dynamic materiality concept proposed by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the dual materiality principle recommended by the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). The analysis, which includes TSMC’s facilities in Taiwan (headquarters, wafer fabs, and advanced backend fabs), TSMC China, TSMC Nanjing, TSMC Arizona, TSMC Washington, LLC, Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing, Inc., VisEra, and other subsidiaries, applies the concepts of impact, risk, and opportunity in conjunction with TSMC’s Risk Management Policy. This process identifies ESG issues and potential challenges with significant implications for operations, enabling TSMC to adjust its sustainability strategies and objectives. By employing innovative thinking and concrete actions, TSMC effectively implements risk mitigation measures, enhances organizational resilience, and deepens its capacity for sustainable development.In addition to the GRI Standards, the TSMC Sustainability Report aligns with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Recommendations, Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) Recommendations, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Standards, the AA1000 Accountability Principles as well as utilizes the Impact Reporting and Investment Standards (IRIS+) to evaluate its public welfare projects. The report is independently verified by DNV Business Assurance Co. Ltd., ensuring that the verification scope and criteria adhere to the DNV VeriSustainTM Protocol, the GRI Standards, SASB Standards, and the TCFD framework, thereby ensuring that the disclosed sustainability information meets stakeholder needs through a diversified standards and verification mechanism.In response to global political, economic, and environmental changes, TSMC proactively fulfills its corporate citizenship responsibilities by aligning with the UN SDGs and examining their relevance to its operations. The Company has set long-term goals for 2030, with specific actions centered around SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals. TSMC collaborates closely with internal and external stakeholders and business partners throughout the value chain to continually explore opportunities for development across economic, environmental, and social dimensions. As the only semiconductor company to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for 24 consecutive years, TSMC is committed to driving sustainable innovation. The Company focuses on ESG in five directions: drive green manufacturing, build a responsible supply chain, create a healthy and inclusive workplace develop talent, and care for the underprivileged. Through these efforts, TSMC aims to generate substantial and positive impacts, fostering a future of shared prosperity.1521537.2 Environmental, Safety and Health (ESH) ManagementTSMC believes its environmental, safety and health (ESH) practices must not only meet legal requirements but should also align with internationally recognized best practices.

To mitigate health risks to employees, suppliers and contractors in the workplace, TSMC has adopted rigorous safety and health control measures focused on preventing occupational injuries and diseases and promoting employee safety, physical and mental health.To minimize supply chain risk and fulfill its corporate citizen responsibility, TSMC not only follows ESH best practices internally but also strives to improve the ESH performance of its suppliers and contractors through audits and counselling.TSMC uses priority work management and self-management to govern services provided by contractors. The Company requires contractors performing level-one high-risk operations to complete certification for technicians and to establish their own ISO 45001 safety and health management system. The emphasis on self-management nurtures the sense of responsibility, with the goal of promoting safety awareness and technical improvement for all contractors in the industry. For onsite contractor personnel, TSMC not only provides standardized courses on safety and health but has also established interactive online training and increased the frequency of such courses to improve effectiveness and safety awareness. To ensure that the Company’s safety protocols are accurately delivered to contractors on a timely basis, TSMC has established a digital platform for mutual communication and blue book for contractors’ safety, health and environmental protection so that onsite operational risks can be mitigated.TSMC collaborates with suppliers to undertake sustainable supply chain management, which includes establishing sustainable standards for suppliers, developing audit plans, conducting audits and tracking improvements, providing guidance and training, and offering further assistances to underperforming suppliers. Key focus in 2024 include enhancing suppliers’ capabilities in environmental, safety, and health (ESH) technologies, improving fire response and water conservation capabilities, and increasing the understanding of biodiversity issues. To achieve these, the Company held the fire emergency response workshops (62 participants from 52 suppliers) and continued the supplier ESH improvement program for senior executives (50 participants from nine suppliers). Additionally, for nine consecutive years, suppliers have been invited to observe TSMC’s annual emergency response drills (217 participants from 212 suppliers) and the Company’s ESH sustainability forum focused on successful case sharing (360 participants from 152 suppliers). TSMC also conducted ESH audits at supplier manufacturing sites and above certifications have been maintained and remain valid. Per TSMC policy, all new facilities are required to attain the aforementioned certifications within 18 months after receiving their operating license.To reduce overall environmental, safety and health risks, TSMC strives for continuous improvement and actively seeks to enhance climate-change management, pollution prevention and control, power and resource conservation, waste reduction and recycling, safety and health management, and fire and explosion prevention, as well as to minimize the impact of earthquake damage.In order to meet regulatory and customer requirements for the management of hazardous materials, TSMC has adopted the IECQ QC 080000 hazardous substance process management (HSPM) system. All TSMC fabs have been QC 080000 certified and have maintained validity since 2006. Through the establishment of QC 080000, TSMC ensures that its products comply with customer requirements and international regulations including the European Union’s Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive, the EU’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, the “halogen-free in electronic products” initiative, perfluorooctane sulfonates (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and related substances restriction standards. In addition, TSMC continuously promote its reduction plan for the use of the hazardous substance N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) and has completed NMP phase-out project for the etching process in overseas subsidiaries by the end of 2024, achieving its annual goal.TSMC began implementing the ISO 50001 energy management system for continuous improvement in energy conservation in 2011. By 2022, all TSMC and its subsidiaries’ manufacturing facilities had received ISO 50001 certification and have maintained it except for TSMC Washington in the U.S, which has been verified by a third party and plans to receive this certification in 2025.Aiming to establish the healthiest possible workplace, in 2017 TSMC formed a corporate-level health promotion committee led by executives at the vice president level to address on an ad-hoc basis occupational disease cases or other health issues. The committee members included fab directors, managers of safety and health department, and representatives from wellness, HR and legal affairs divisions. External experts were also invited to discuss the potential risks of occupational 154155actively assists suppliers in improving their ESH performance. A new ESH Technical Forum was introduced to provide solutions to common ESH issues (199 participants from 175 suppliers). Furthermore, the Company requested that suppliers conduct a carbon emissions inventory and encouraged them to reduce these emissions and implement measures to save energy, conserve water and reduce waste.7.2.1 Environmental ProtectionClimate Change and Energy Management●Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)To address the potential financial risks of climate change on operations, in 2018 TSMC adopted the TCFD’s recommendations released by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to identify risks and opportunities and further establish metrics and management targets based on the results identified.Management Structure of TSMC Climate-related Risks and OpportunitiesCategoryManagement Strategy and Actions GovernanceBoard of Directors periodically reviews climate change related risks and opportunities●ESG Steering Committee: TSMC’s top organization in climate change management.

In response to threats presented by extreme weather, TSMC sets strategies and targets, ensures sound execution and strives to build a sustainable culture. In 2021, TSMC announced its long-term goal of net zero emissions by 2050, while setting the short-term goal of zero growth in emissions by 2025. By actively implementing emission reduction measures, the Company is working to return its carbon emissions to 2020 levels by 2030.The Company actively participates in the initiatives of the World Semiconductor Council (WSC) and has leveraged its past experience to develop best practices, which have been fully adopted and implemented by the Company since 2012 to reduce perfluorinated compounds (PFC) emissions. In 2018, in accordance with the Ministry of Environment’s regulation, “Greenhouse Gas Offset Project Management Regulations”, TSMC applied for recognition of GHG reduction and accumulatively received 1.5 million tons of carbon dioxide credits since 2022. Those carbon credits can be used to offset GHG emissions of new manufacturing facilities regulated by environmental impact assessment (EIA) Act in support of the Company’s sustainable operations and mitigate climate-change risk.Since 2005, TSMC has completed the GHG inventory program and taken a complete inventory of its GHG emissions to gain ISO 14064 certification. The inventory shows that the major direct GHG emissions are PFCs, which are widely used in semiconductor manufacturing. The primary indirect GHG emission is electricity consumption. The analysis of the inventory data was performed not only to meet domestic regulatory reporting requirements but also to serve as a baseline reference for the Company’s strategy to reduce GHG emissions. For the last 20 years TSMC has worked with the CDP, an international non-profit organization, to publicly disclose climate change information and to continuously review and improve related management practices.In response to the Paris global climate agreement and the R.O.C. Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act, TSMC initiated a cross-functional platform for carbon management in 2016. The three areas of focus of this platform are legal compliance, emission reduction, and carbon credit acquisition. In addition to participating in official regulatory consultation and communications meetings, the Company also sets short-, medium- and long-term reduction targets through the Energy Saving and Carbon Reduction Committee led by the fab operations’ senior executive. The measures are carried out by energy and carbon reduction teams of individual fabs. Because more than 80% of TSMC’s GHG emissions come from electricity consumption, the Company emphasizes energy conservation and carbon reduction initiatives. TSMC has not only implemented energy-conserving designs in its manufacturing fabs and offices but has also continuously improved the energy efficiency in operating its facilities. These efforts simultaneously reduce carbon dioxide gas emissions and costs. As a result, TSMC has conserved 4.7 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of power since 2016. In 2023, Taiwan renamed the “Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act” to the “Climate Change Response Act” and amended the provisions, setting a target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and establishing a carbon fee mechanism. In 2024, three subordinate regulations were announced: the “Carbon Fee Charging Measures”, “Regulations on the Management of Voluntary Emission Reduction Programs” and “Designated Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets for Entities Subject to Carbon Fee Collection” and the rate of carbon fee was also set and announced. For emitters with direct and indirect emissions exceeding a certain threshold, carbon fees will be levied starting in 2025. As TSMC’s emissions in Taiwan exceed the current regulatory threshold, the Company will pay a carbon fee in 2026 for the first time. TSMC will continue to integrate green (Continued)156157management into its daily operations, actively implement greenhouse gas reduction targets, and propose a voluntary reduction plan to obtain preferential rates, thereby mitigating the financial impact on the Company.Since 2018, TSMC has aggressively negotiated the purchase of renewable energy from suppliers in Taiwan. The Company aims to achieve 60% of its electricity consumption from renewable energy by 2030 on the way to fulfilling its long-term commitment of 100% renewable energy usage by 2040. Also since 2018, TSMC overseas manufacturing fabs and offices have purchased renewable energy, REC and carbon credits to offset all carbon emissions caused by power consumption. All TSMC overseas sites achieved net zero emissions in 2024. The development of renewable energy in Taiwan has recently entered an active planning and construction phase, and TSMC’s renewable energy task force continues to communicate with the government, offering suggestions related to the development of renewable energy, with the hope of collaborating with the government to accelerate the progress of renewable energy in Taiwan. TSMC continues to increase its procurement amount of renewable energy. By the end of 2024, the total installation capacity of renewable energy contracted reached 4.4 GW (gigawatts). The renewable energy will be provided to TSMC gradually after the related business process has been completed. This is a clear manifestation of the Company’s active support of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). TSMC GHG Reduction Target and Achievement StatusStrategy2030 Goal2024 Target and AchievementAchievement StatusContinue to use best available technology to reduce GHG emissions and become an industry leader in low-carbon manufacturingReduce GHG emissions per unit product (metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e)/12-inch equivalent wafer mask layer) by 30% (base year: 2020)GHG emissions per unit product (metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e)/12-inch equivalent wafer mask layer) increased by 19% (target: -10%)Unachieved (Note)Note:  Target not achieved due to increase in production capacity of advanced processes and related carbon emissions, as well as the insufficiency of reduction plans and available renewable energy. TSMC will, therefore, continue to implement more energy saving and carbon reduction actions.Air and Water Pollution Control The Company has installed air and water pollution control equipment in each fab to meet regulatory emissions requirements. In addition, TSMC maintains backup pollution control systems, including emergency power supplies, to mitigate the risk of pollutant emissions in the event of equipment failure. The Company centrally monitors the operations of its air and water pollution control equipment 24 hours a day by rotating staff and treats system effectiveness as an important tracking item to ensure the quality of emitted air and discharged water.To further enhance water resources sustainability, TSMC has adopted and followed the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) standard, the sustainable water management standard (Note). The annual verification for 2024 was completed at the Taichung sites (Fab 15A and Fab 15B) and the Tainan sites (Fab 6, Fab 14 Phase 7, and Fab 14B), and platinum-level certification has been maintained.In view of TSMC’s global operation, and to comply with international regulations and standards, TSMC’s Facility Development Division formed a green manufacturing department- Environmental Monitoring Center. This center regularly integrates effluent monitoring data to provide more timely water quality reports and establish effluent baselines, enabling early responses and ensuring compliance with environmental regulations. Also, in pursuit of technological innovation, the Company collaborated with academic institutions and suppliers to successfully implement drinking water-grade bituminous coal Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) in 2024. This adsorption filtration technology is used to treat process wastewater containing per/poly fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), achieving an average removal rate of 95%. In 2024, TSMC continued to implement four major water saving measures: improving the water production rate of the system, reducing facility system water consumption, increasing the wastewater recycling of facilities, and decreasing water discharge loss from the system. The overall system has increased water conservation by 5.54 million cubic meters.The goal of water management at TSMC is to optimize the use of every drop of water. In addition to implementing process water-saving measures, TSMC collaborates with industrial, governmental and academic organizations to invest in the development of water reclamation technology. Through participation in the professional committee activities of the Taiwan Science Park Association, TSMC shares water-saving experiences and professional knowledge with semiconductor industry peers to achieve the common goal of the entire park and ensure long-term water resource supply-demand balance. In order to further circulate the use of water resources and support the government’s promotion of reclaimed water, TSMC launched the Southern Taiwan Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant operation in 2022. It is the first private water reclamation plant in Taiwan and the industry’s first to introduce reclaimed water into semiconductor manufacturing process. In addition to reclaimed water by that plant, TSMC’s fabs in Southern Taiwan Science Park also started using reclaimed water supplied by the Yongkang and Anping plants when they started up in 2022 and 2023 respectively. The cumulative supply use of reclaimed water exceeded 67 thousand cubic meters per day and, by the end of 2024, over 19.65 million cubic meters of reclaimed water had been used in the semiconductor manufacturing process in TSMC’s Tainan fabs. This reduced city water usage by 31% as the Company reached a 17% replacement rate using reclaimed water. TSMC is committed to promoting reclaimed water use in all newly constructed fabs in the future.TSMC Water Usage in Recent Two YearsYearTotal Water Usage (million m3) (Note 1)Unit Product Water Usage (L/12-inch wafer-e-layer)2024129161.02023114176.4TSMC Water Usage Reduction Target and Achievement StatusStrategy2030 Goal2024 Target and AchievementAchievement StatusEnforce climate change mitigation policies, implement water conservation and water shortage adaptation measuresReduce unit water consumption (liter/12-inch equivalent wafer mask layer) by 30% (base year: 2010)Increased unit water consumption by 14.3% (Target: -2.7%)Unachieved (Note 2)Note 1: Includes TSMC fabs in Taiwan and subsidiaries total use of city water and reclaimed water.Note 2:  Affected by the global economic cycle, TSMC’s capacity utilization rate had not yet stabilized in the first half of 2024. The water usage per unit of product did not meet the annual target, and the company will continue to develop diverse water resources to reduce tap water consumption.Waste Management and RecyclingWaste production at TSMC has risen in recent years as TSMC continues to develop advanced manufacturing processes and rapidly expand its production capacity both at home and overseas. This increase is due to the complexity of new manufacturing processes, the demand for reliable yield rates, and the increased use of raw materials.To achieve the goal of sustainable resource utilization, TSMC has a designated unit responsible for waste recycling and disposal. The priorities are onsite process waste reduction and offsite recycling and regeneration, with incineration and landfill as the least desirable, final option. In 2017, TSMC amended its articles of incorporation to add four business items for chemical materials to enhance waste process flow and reduce risks of improper waste disposal by commissioned agencies. It also set up onsite resource activation facilities to convert waste resources produced during manufacturing process into products to be used onsite or to sell to other industries. TSMC recycled copper sulfate waste, cobalt-containing liquid waste, sulfuric acid waste and ammonium sulfate waste, all of which were regenerated into products. The Company also developed a system of cryolite synthesis whereby hydrogen fluoride (HF) waste is recycled and regenerated into raw material that can be used in other industries. In 2024, in addition to having recycled cyclopentanone for use as an electronic-grade material the previous year, TSMC continued to collaborate with suppliers to enhance filtration and electrolysis processes. TSMC has successfully recycled tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) to meet its process requirements for electronic-grade materials. The recycled TMAH has been integrated into the fab process, establishing a sustainable recycling cycle. Concurrently, the Company has been actively working to reduce incineration volumes as its fabs in Taiwan achieved a 95% waste recycling rate for the tenth consecutive year, with a landfill rate below 1% for the 15th consecutive year. In addition, in 2024 TSMC successfully separated aluminum and plastic from foil bags, reclaiming them as aluminum ingots and plastic pallets. TSMC will continue to strive towards its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050.Note:  TSMC AWS certified fabs include Advanced Backend Fab 3, Fab 5, Fab 12A/B, Fab 15A/B, Fab 6, Fab 14B and Fab 14 Phase 7, covering the watersheds of all the fab locations across the Hsinchu, Central Taiwan and Southern Taiwan Science Park.158159TSMC Waste Quantity and Outsourced Unit Waste Disposal in Recent Two Years (Note 1)YearOutsourced General Waste (ton) (Note 2)Outsourced Hazardous Waste (ton) (Note 2)Outsourced Unit Waste Disposal (Note 3)(kg/12-inch equivalent wafer mask layer)2024344,056445,1521.162023 285,605371,2361.17Note 1: The data in the table are preliminary results collected by TSMC and have not yet been verified by a third partyNote 2: Totals include Taiwan and subsidiary facilitiesNote 3: Taiwan facilitiesTSMC Waste Reduction Target and Achievement StatusStrategy2030 Goal2024 Target and AchievementAchievement StatusPromote waste reduction by source separation and require vendors to provide low chemical consumption equipmentOutsourced unit waste disposal per wafer ≦ 0.50 (kg/12-inch equivalent wafer mask layer)Outsourced unit waste disposal per wafer 1.16 (kg/12-inch equivalent wafer mask layer) target: ≦1.17AchievedIn order to ensure that all waste is treated and recycled properly, TSMC closely tracks the recycling and reuse practices of its cleanup and disposal vendors. The Company carefully selects waste disposal and recycling vendors that are certified and have the required permits. TSMC regularly checks the onsite operational status, disposal declaration forms, operational records, etc., to compare with actual reuse and disposal, and takes proactive steps to strengthen vendor auditing. For example, all waste transportation contractors have agreed to join the GPS satellite fleet so that the cleanup transportation routes and abnormal stays for all trucks can be traced. All waste recycling and disposal vendors have installed closed-circuit TV systems at operating sites to monitor and audit waste handling. At the same time, to further guarantee proper waste handling, in 2022 TSMC built the system of waste intelligent fast track (S.W.I.F.T.) and completed five different types of waste treatment vendors for pilot testing. As of 2024, 44% of waste treatment vendors have instituted S.W.I.F.T. and TSMC intends to roll it out to all waste treatment vendors by 2030. Using AI technology in lieu of in-person on-site spot checks increases inspection efficiency 65-fold and reduces manual inspection by 13,000 hours each year. In addition, TSMC conducts ongoing surveys of recycled product tracking and requires all recycling contractors to report their recycled product sales monthly to track waste flow and ensure that actions are taken to adhere to lawful and proper waste recycling and treatment.Environmental AccountingThe purpose of TSMC’s environmental accounting system is to identify and quantify environmental costs for internal management. At the same time, the Company also calculates and evaluates the savings or economic benefits of environmental protection programs so as to continuously promote economically effective programs. While environmental expenses are expected to continue to rise, environmental accounting can help manage these costs more effectively. TSMC’s approach measures various environmental costs, establishes independent environmental account codes, and provides the data to all units for use in annual budgeting. The Company’s economic benefit evaluation calculates cost savings for energy conservation, water or waste reductions and recycling benefits in accordance with its environmental protection programs. The benefits disclosed in this report include real income from projects such as waste recycling as well as savings from major environmental projects. In 2024, the total benefits of environmental protection programs of TSMC fabs including waste recycling exceeded NT$5.8 billion.2024 Environmental Cost of TSMC Fabs in TaiwanUnit: NT$ thousandsClassificationDescriptionExpenseInvestment1.

All TSMC fabs in Taiwan have received Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System (TOSHMS) certification since 2009.In 2018, the International Organization for Standardization released ISO 45001: 2018, replacing OHSAS 18001. This new standard introduced major changes, including an expanded scope, increased support and participation from leadership, and a focus on both internal and external issues. It also addressed the expectations and demands of stakeholders, the assessment of risk inspections, communication and consultation with non-managers, the application of performance indicators, and the evaluation of corrective and preventive actions. These changes ensure that the system can be effectively implemented at the management level through 1641651.  Exposure and health risk assessment: develop an exposure assessment system to identify high health risk employees.2.  Hazardous training and notification: use standardized training materials for employees and contractors in all TSMC fabs. Inform them of the health risks and prevention measures at the workplace before they begin working or providing any services there.3.  Management of chemicals with significant health risks: request that all materials suppliers prove to TSMC that they comply with applicable laws including clear disclosure of any hazardous substances. Perform sampling of raw materials used in the manufacturing process to confirm that they do not contain any carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic-reproductive materials as claimed on supplier’s safety data sheets.●Emergency ResponseThe planning and execution of an effective emergency response require identifying potential high-risk events via risk assessment and being prepared for various scenarios and should focus on continuous improvements and drills covering all potentially serious events. TSMC’s emergency response plans include procedures for rapid-response, crisis management and disaster recovery from potential incidents.All TSMC fabs conduct major annual emergency response exercises and evacuation drills. TSMC’s onsite service contractors are also required to participate in emergency response planning and exercises to ensure cooperation in handling accidents and to effectively minimize any damage caused by disasters. In 2024, the Company held 116 evacuation drills and 66 fire drills. At least every two years, each fab director invites fab management and support functions to participate in business continuity drills for potentially high-risk events such as earthquake, fire and flood (at the Tainan site). Since 2018, TSMC has conducted numerous comprehensive accident emergency response drills, including simultaneous scenarios for earthquake, fire and chemical spills, to ensure rapid response to emergencies so that losses can be minimized in the event of a real disaster. In 2020, TSMC took the lead in the industry by introducing the all-hazard approach as recommended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to conduct disaster prevention exercises.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, TSMC added tabletop exercises to disaster prevention training in an effort to minimize the risks of group infections that might arise in full-scale, in-person exercises. The inclusion of tabletop exercises also aids in the verification of full-scale exercise procedures to make disaster response more comprehensive, thus effectively mitigating the impact of various types of disasters on business continuity in the future. As of 2024, in addition to 126 sessions of tabletop exercises, 608 full-scale exercises had been completed.In addition to the regular emergency response drills held by engineering and facilities departments each quarter, the Company’s laboratory, canteen, dormitory, and shuttle bus personnel also hold similar drills to prepare for events such as earthquakes, chemical spills, ammonia releases, fires and traffic accidents. Conduct annual inventory of the public hazardous substances in all fabs to identify potential risks and enhance the disaster prevention management capabilities of the fab, effectively reducing the risks of fires and legal violations.●Emerging Infectious Disease ResponseTSMC has a dedicated corporate ESH organization to monitor emerging infectious diseases around the world, to assess any potential impact on the workplace, and to provide an appropriate strategic response plan. In previous outbreaks such as SARS in 2003, H1N1 influenza in 2009, and MERS in 2015, as well as with COVID-19 from 2019 to 2023, TSMC followed the Taiwan CDC’s (Center for Disease Control) rules and convened the corporate influenza response committee to develop the Company’s strategies. These strategies included educating employees in prevention and response, publishing guidelines for managers, establishing guidelines for employee sick leave, and installing alcohol-based hand sanitizers at appropriate locations. The Committee also monitors the status of employee leave due to illness and, at the same time, develops a continuity plan to address manpower shortages and minimize business impact. For example, during the COVID-19 outbreak, in order to protect the health of TSMC employees, their families, and work partners, employees were encouraged to be fully vaccinated if in healthy condition. In addition, TSMC periodically reviewed the situation and implemented appropriate preventive measures such as providing updated vaccination information and performing daily body temperature checks before entering Company facilities, while continuing to follow standard epidemic prevention recommendations such as mask wearing, frequent hand washing and social distancing.●Employee Physical and Mental Health EnhancementTSMC believes that employee physical and mental health is not only fundamental to maintaining sound business operations but is also an important part of a corporation’s responsibility. To preserve and promote the physical and mental health of its employees, TSMC fosters collaboration among the onsite industrial safety and environmental protection department, the onsite medical personnel of the health center, and physicians of occupational medicine. TSMC strives to reduce cerebral injuries and cardiovascular conditions that might be induced or aggravated by overwork, night work or shift work.The Company conducts programs for maternal health protection and for prevention of cumulative trauma disorders as well. TSMC devotes significant resources to mental health awareness, focused not only on hazards at work but also on employee health in general. In 2024, planned personal health management activities included the following: 1) 539 female employees participated in the maternal health program with a completion rate of 100%. All of them were at first degree risk, where there was no potential harm to the mother or infant. (2) Through analysis of historical cerebral and cardiovascular cases of its employees, combined with internal annual health examination reports and work scheduling information, the Company was able to identify 5,071 employees with middle to high risk for cerebral and cardiovascular diseases. These employees were provided with health education and medical assistance. Also, they and their managers received recommended changes in working hours and shifts to reduce health risks. (3) 171 employees were identified as high risk for cumulative trauma disorders, including two who might also have job-related risks, and the Company adjusted working conditions accordingly to reduce potential risks. (4) Obesity is recognized as a potential catalyst for various health issues, including high blood sugar, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and insomnia. In response, TSMC has diligently organized health promotion initiatives over the years. In 2024, acknowledging the younger generation’s preference for multimedia content, the Company enhanced its digital tool usage to broaden employees’ access to health information. In addition to conducting physical weight loss programs, which saw 7,180 participants collectively shedding 6,534 kilograms, the Company meticulously curated a series of online interactive health education events. These initiatives included expert-led seminars focused on topics such as healthy eating and exercise, conducted across seven sessions and engaging 1,482 participants.For mental health, in 2024, six psychologists were appointed to address mental health, designing tailored health knowledge and activities for different groups within the Company. These initiatives included: (a) employee lectures, with 79 sessions and 3,107 attendees; (b) mindfulness workshops, with eight sessions attended by 402 attendees; (c) a World Mental Health Month with online lectures and questionnaires, involving 3,435 attendees. Additionally, the interactive “Three Good Things” activity drew 1,708 attendees.
