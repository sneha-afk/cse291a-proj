116117having to pay damages for its delayed or disrupted orders or incur significant expenses in implementing remedial and improvement measures to enhance its cybersecurity network, and may also expose the Company to significant legal liabilities arising from or related to legal proceedings or regulatory investigations associated with, among other things, leakage of employee, customer or third-party information which the company has an obligation to keep confidential.In the past, TSMC experienced and may in the future be subject to attack by malicious software contained in the equipment the Company purchases and installs. TSMC has implemented and continually updated rigorous cybersecurity measures to prevent and minimize harm caused by such attacks. These measures include advanced virus scanning tools to prevent a fab from installing virus-infected tools, strengthening firewall and network controls to prevent computer viruses from spreading among tools and fabs, and the installation of anti-virus and advanced malware detection solutions across our computer devices. In addition, TSMC has deployed secure PCs and laptops, developed a public cloud security policy, introduced new technology for data protection, and improved email phishing detection. TSMC also established an integrated and automatic security operation platform, and it regularly perform employee awareness testing and conduct external security risk assessments. While these ongoing enhancements further improve Company’s cybersecurity defense solutions, there can be no assurance that the Company is immune to cyberattacks.In addition, TSMC employs certain third-party service providers for the Company and its affiliates worldwide with whom it needs to share highly sensitive and confidential information to enable them to provide the relevant services. Despite that the Company requires the third-party service providers to comply with the confidentiality and/or internet security requirements in its service agreements with them, there is no assurance that each of them will strictly fulfill such obligations, or at all. The on-site network systems of and the off-site cloud computing networks such as servers maintained by such service providers and/or its contractors are also subject to risks associated with cyberattacks. If TSMC or its service providers are not able to timely resolve the respective technical difficulties caused by such cyberattacks, or ensure the integrity and availability of its data (and data belonging to its customers and other third parties) or control of its or its service providers’ computing systems, the Company’s commitments to its customers and other stakeholders may be materially impaired and its results of operations, financial condition, prospects and reputation may also be materially and adversely affected as a result.Risks Associated with Intellectual Property RightsThe Company’s ability to compete successfully and to achieve future growth depends in part on the continued strength of its intellectual property portfolio. While we actively enforce and protect our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that its efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of its proprietary technologies, software, trade secrets or know-how. Also, the Company cannot assure you that, as its business or business models expand into new areas, it will be able to develop independently the technologies, patents, software, trade secrets or know-how necessary to conduct its business or that it can do so without unknowingly infringing the intellectual property rights of others. As a result, TSMC may have to rely on, to a certain degree, licensed technologies and patent licenses from others. To the extent that the Company relies on licenses from others, there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain any or all of the necessary licenses in the future on terms it considers reasonable or at all. The lack of necessary licenses could expose TSMC to claims for damages and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by its customers in instances where it has contractually agreed to indemnify its customers against damages resulting from infringement claims.TSMC has received, from time to time, communications from third parties, including non-practicing entities and semiconductor companies, asserting that TSMC’s technologies, its manufacturing processes, or the design IPs of the semiconductors made by TSMC or the use of those semiconductors by its customers may infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. Because of the nature of the industry, its market position, and the expansion of its manufacturing operations in foreign jurisdictions, the Company may receive an increased number of such communications in the future. The assertions made and lawsuits initiated by litigious, well-funded, non-practicing entities are particularly aggressive in their monetary demand and in seeking court-issued injunctions. Such lawsuits and assertions may increase TSMC’s cost of doing business and may potentially be extremely disruptive if these asserting entities succeed in blocking the trade of products made and services offered by TSMC. Also, with the Company’s expansion of its manufacturing operations into certain non-R.O.C. jurisdictions, it has faced increased challenges in managing risks of intellectual property misappropriation. Despite our efforts to adopt robust measures to mitigate the risk of intellectual property misappropriation in such new jurisdictions, we cannot guarantee that the protection measures we adopted will be sufficient to prevent us from potential infringements by others, or at all.If TSMC fails to obtain or maintain certain technologies or intellectual property licenses or fails to prevent our intellectual property from being misappropriated and, if litigation relating to alleged intellectual property matters occurs, it could: (1) prevent the Company from manufacturing particular products or selling particular services or applying particular technologies; and (2) reduce our ability to compete effectively against entities benefiting from our misappropriated intellectual property, which could reduce its opportunities to generate revenue.TSMC has taken related measures to minimize potential loss of shareholder value arising from intellectual property claims and litigation filed against the Company. These measures include: strategically obtaining licenses from certain semiconductor and other technology companies as needed; timely securing intellectual property rights originating within and outside of TSMC for defensive and/or offensive protection of TSMC technology and business; and aggressively defending against baseless litigation.Risks Associated with Litigious and Non-litigious MattersAs is the case with many companies in the semiconductor industry, we have received from time to time communications from third parties asserting that its technologies, its manufacturing processes, or the design of the semiconductors made by TSMC or the use of those semiconductors by its customers may infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights. These assertions have at times resulted in litigation by or against the Company and settlement payments by the Company. Irrespective of the validity of these claims, TSMC could incur significant costs in the defense thereof or could suffer adverse effects on its operations. TSMC is also subject to antitrust compliance requirements and scrutiny by governmental regulators in multiple jurisdictions. Any adverse results of such proceeding or other similar proceedings that may arise in those jurisdictions could harm TSMC’s business and distract its management, and thereby have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or prospects, and subject TSMC to potential significant legal liability.Currently, TSMC’s material legal proceedings are as follows:On September 28, 2017, TSMC was contacted by the European Commission (the “Commission”), which asked us for information and documents concerning alleged anti-competitive practices in relation to semiconductor sales. We cooperated continuously with the Commission to provide the requested information and documents. The Commission subsequently decided to close the investigation in May 2020.Other than the matters described above, as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC is not currently a party to any other material legal proceedings.Risks Associated with Mergers and AcquisitionsIn 2020 and as of the date of this annual report, TSMC did not conduct any merger or acquisition.Risks Associated with Recruiting Quality PersonnelTSMC relies on the continued services and contributions of its management team skilled technical and professional personnel. The Company’s business could suffer from the inability to fulfill personnel needs with high quality professionals in a timely fashion caused by the loss of personnel, illegal talent poaching, or related changes in market demand for its products and services. Since there is fierce competition for talent recruitment, the Company cannot ensure timely fulfillment of its personnel demand.In order to reduce the risk of talent recruitment, TSMC encourages job rotation and implements on-the-job training and certification system. In this way, employees can learn and enhance their work efficiency in the actual work field. Moreover, TSMC creates multiple recruitment channels and continues to hire top-notch talents from Taiwan and overseas. TSMC recruits diversified and various special professional talents, and at the same time strengthen industry-academic cooperation. Grasp outstanding talents earlier can help TSMC recruit them in the future.Future R&D Plans and Expected R&D SpendingFor additional details, see “5.2.7 Future R&D Plans” on page 86-87 of this annual report.Changes in Corporate Reputation and Impact on Company’s Crisis ManagementTSMC has established an excellent corporate reputation around the world based on its core values of integrity, commitment, innovation and customer trust. The Company’s positive image also reflects outstanding operations, rigorous corporate governance and dedication to social responsibility by serving as a good corporate citizen. TSMC continues to pursue innovation in the economic, environmental and social dimensions of CSR.118119In 2020, TSMC was honored with numerous awards for achievements in operations, corporate governance, patents, profit growth, investor relations, environmental protection, corporate sustainability and other fields. These included: the Taiwan Institute for Sustainable Energy 2020 Taiwan Corporate Sustainability Awards’ Most Prestigious Sustainability Award, Platinum Medal For Sustainability Report, Sustainable Water Management Award, Climate Leader Award, and Supply Chain Management Award; First Place in CommonWealth Magazine’s Excellence in Corporate Social Responsibility Award for Large-Cap companies; ranked top 5% in the Taiwan Stock Exchange corporate governance evaluation; member of Fortune Magazine’s 2020 World’s Most Admired Companies and the 2020 Global 500; the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic Affairs Industrial Development Bureau’s Green Factory Label and Energy Conservation Benchmark Award; the R.O.C. Environmental Protection Administration’s Enterprise Green Procurement Award; Membership in the Corporate Knights 100 Most Sustainable Corporations for 2020; ranked No.1 in the 2020 Carbon Clean 200 list by Corporate Knights and As You Sow; Membership in the Wall Street Journal’s 100 Most Sustainably Managed Companies; and named Most Impactful Pioneer in the 2020 RE100 Leadership Awards. In addition, TSMC was selected as a part of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for the 20th consecutive year.TSMC adheres to its vision of uplifting society, and applies technology and innovation to help humanity overcome many challenges. As TSMC strives to excel in corporate social responsibility, the Company also encourages employees to make innovative breakthroughs in how they think about things and do things, as well as nurture their empathy and broaden their horizons. In 2020, the Corporate Social Responsibility Executive Committee, led by Chairman Dr. Mark Liu, held the first “TSMC CSR AWARD,” taking tangible action to encourage all employees to propose ideas for sustainability in the five strategic directions of corporate social responsibility, including green manufacturing, building a responsible supply chain, creating an inclusive workplace, talent development, and caring for the underprivileged. The award further motivates TSMC colleagues to think innovatively about their work, implement corporate social responsibility, and build further on the Company’s positive corporate reputation.With its global reputation in mind, TSMC employs numerous preventative measures to address potential risks from earthquakes, fires, IT service disruption, yield loss, information security, supply chain disruption, pandemics, environmental events, and utility supply disruption. TSMC sets crisis response and recovery measures according to possible crisis events and maintains a “TSMC crisis command center control instruction” as well as a “TSMC emergency response procedure” to establish its emergency response command structure. TSMC also holds regular exercises for crisis scenarios to ensure that crisis response procedures are comprehensive.TSMC holds regular monthly meetings of the Environment, Safety and Health Committee, which coordinates relevant departments in each fab to conduct regular emergency response drills and continuously improve their notification and operational procedures to ensure clear channels of communication to stakeholders in crisis management, with the public relations department serving as the designated gateway for external communications.In the event of an emergency, all departments immediately deploy emergency response measures to eliminate or minimize impact on personnel safety, the surrounding environment, company property and manufacturing operations. Responders also alert the public relations department at the earliest stages of response to ensure timely, clear and consistent communication regarding the situation.Risks Associated with Change in ManagementDuring 2020 and as of the date of this Annual Report, there were no such risks for TSMC.6.3.4 Financial RisksEconomic Risks●Interest Rate FluctuationTSMC is exposed to interest rate risks primarily related to its investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and fixed income securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as the interest paid on its debt.The objective of TSMC’s investment policy is to achieve a return that will allow the Company to preserve principal and support liquidity requirements. The policy generally requires the Company to invest in securities with investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. TSMC’s cash and cash equivalents as well as fixed income investments in both fixed- and floating-rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. The majority of TSMC’s fixed income investments are fixed-rate securities, which are classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, and may have their fair value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates. At the same time, if interest rates fall, cash and cash equivalents as well as floating-rate securities may generate less interest income than expected.TSMC has entered and may in the future enter into interest rate futures to partially hedge the interest rate risk on its fixed income investments. However, these hedges can offset only a small portion of the financial impact from movements in interest rates.All of the Company’s short-term debt is floating-rate, hence a rise in interest rates may result in higher interest expense than expected. The majority of its long-term debt is fixed-rate and measured at amortized cost and as such, changes in interest rates would not affect the future cash flows and the carrying amount.Certain of TSMC’s fixed income investments and short-term debt are primarily based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which is expected to be replaced by other benchmark rates after 2021. TSMC cannot predict the consequences and timing of these developments, or whether such a transition might cause a reduction in its interest income and/or an increase in its interest expense.●Foreign Exchange VolatilitySubstantially all of TSMC’s sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and over half of its capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than NT dollars, primarily in U.S. dollars, Euros, and Japanese yen. As a result, any significant fluctuations to its disadvantage in the exchange rate of the NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on the Company’s revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollars. For example, every one percent depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar would result in an approximately 0.4 percentage point decrease in the Company’s operating margin based on its 2020 results.Conversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly versus other major currencies, the demand for the products and services of TSMC’s customers and for TSMC’s goods and services will likely decrease, which will negatively affect the Company’s revenue.TSMC uses foreign currency derivative contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-NT-dollar-denominated assets and liabilities and certain forecasted transactions. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on its assets and liabilities.Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the NT dollar may affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s common shares and the market price of the Company’s American Depositary Shares (ADSs) and of any cash dividends paid in NT dollar on TSMC’s common shares represented by ADSs.●InflationIn 2020 and as of the date of this annual report, inflation had no material impact on TSMC’s operations, or the business operations of its customers and suppliers.●Amendments to Tax Regulations or Implementation of New Tax LawsAny amendments to existing tax regulations or the implementation of any new tax laws in the jurisdictions in which TSMC operates its business may have an adverse effect on its net income.While the Company is subject to tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which it operates or conducts business, TSMC’s principal operations are in the R.O.C. and it is exposed primarily to taxes levied by the R.O.C. government. Any unfavorable changes of tax laws and regulations in this jurisdiction could increase TSMC’s effective tax rate and have an adverse effect on its operating results.In order to control tax risk, the Company closely monitors all domestic and foreign governmental policies and regulations that might impact its financial operations. TSMC has established risk management procedures to collect information, analyze potential tax implications, and develop countermeasures.Risks Associated with External FinancingIn times of market instability, sufficient external financing may not be available to the Company on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms to the Company, or at all. If sufficient external financing is not available when TSMC needs such financing to meet its capital requirements, the Company may be forced to curtail its expansion, modify plans or delay the deployment of new or expanded services until it obtains such financing.120121Risks Associated with High-Risk/Highly Leveraged Investments; Lending, Endorsements, and Guarantees for Other Parties; and Financial Derivative TransactionsIn 2020 and as of the date of this annual report, TSMC made no high-risk or highly leveraged financial investments.In 2020 and as of the date of this annual report, TSMC has provided guarantees to TSMC Global, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TSMC, for its issuances of US dollar-denominated senior unsecured bonds in amounts not to exceed US$7.5 billion in total. Among which, US$3 billion senior unsecured bonds were already issued in September 2020. Since 2014, TSMC has provided a guarantee of no more than US$83.21 million to TSMC North America, a wholly owned subsidiary of TSMC, for its obligation to an office leasing contract. Since 2020, TSMC Japan Limited has provided a guarantee of no more than JPY1,320 million to TSMC Design Technology Japan, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of TSMC, for its obligation to an office leasing contract.As of February 28, 2021, there were RMB 4.8 billion outstanding intercompany loans between TSMC’s subsidiaries, and US$3.1 billion outstanding intercompany loans between TSMC and its subsidiary. All intercompany loans were in compliance with relevant rules and regulations.All derivative financial transactions entered in 2020 by TSMC were strictly for hedging and not for trading or speculative purposes. For more transaction information and risk assessment, please refer to Note 7, Note 10, and Note 32 of the annual report section (II), Financial Statements.To manage risks of various financial transactions, TSMC has established internal control policies and procedures based on sound financial and business practices, all in compliance with the relevant rules and regulations issued by the Taiwan Securities and Futures Bureau. TSMC’s policies and procedures include “Procedures for Financial Derivatives Transactions,” “Procedures for Lending Funds to Other Parties,” “Procedures for Acquisition or Disposal of Assets,” and “Procedures for Endorsement and Guarantee”.Risks Associated with Impairment ChargesUnder Taiwan-IFRSs, TSMC is required to evaluate its tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. If certain criteria are met, TSMC is required to record an impairment charge. TSMC is not able to estimate the extent or timing of any impairment charge for future years. Any impairment charge required may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s net income.The determination of an impairment charge at any given time is mainly based on the projected results of operations over several years subsequent to that time. Consequently, an impairment charge is more likely to occur during a period when the Company’s operating results are otherwise already depressed. See “Note 5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION AND UNCERTAINTY” in Annual Report section (II), Financial Statements for a discussion of how TSMC assesses if an impairment charge is required and, if so, how the amount is determined.6.3.5  Hazardous Risks and Utility Supply Interruption or Shortage RisksThe frequency and severity of disruptive events, including damaging earthquakes, other natural disasters and severe weather, have been increasing in part due to climate change or systemic regional geological changes. TSMC has manufacturing and other operations in locations subject to natural disasters such as flooding, earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons and droughts that may cause interruptions or shortages in the supply of utilities, such as water and electricity, which in turn could disrupt operations. For example, in 2021, Taiwan has faced one of the worst droughts in decades. Government restrictions on supply and usage of water by industrial companies such as TSMC in response to such severe weather events could also disrupt our operations. In addition, TSMC’s suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. For example, most of TSMC’s production facilities, as well as those of many of its suppliers and customers and upstream providers of complementary semiconductor manufacturing services, are located in Taiwan and Japan, areas susceptible to earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons, and droughts from time to time that may cause shortages in electricity or water, or interruptions to the Company’s operations.Thus, if one or more natural disasters that result in a prolonged disruption to TSMC’s operations or those of its customers or suppliers, or if any of its fabs or vendor facilities were to be damaged or cease operations as a result of an explosion or fire, it could reduce the Company’s manufacturing capacity and cause the loss of important customers and thereby have an adverse and material impact on its operational and financial performance.TSMC has occasionally suffered power outages or surges in Taiwan caused by difficulties encountered by its electricity supplier, the Taiwan Power Company, or other power consumers on the same power grid. Some of these have resulted in interruptions to TSMC operations. Such shortages or interruptions in electricity supply could further be exacerbated by changes in the energy policy of the government, which intends to make Taiwan a nuclear-free country by 2025. If the Company is unable to secure reliable and uninterrupted supply of electricity to power its manufacturing fabs within Taiwan, its ability to fill customers’ orders would be severely jeopardized.If such events were to occur over prolonged periods of time, TSMC’s operations and financial performance may be materially adversely affected.Future expansions of TSMC’s operations in the R.O.C. could be limited by shortages in water and electricity, and the limited availability of commercial-use land.The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may materially adversely affect TSMC business and results of operations in several ways, including but not limited to: (1) interruption of the operations of TSMC’s supply chains for equipment, parts and materials in terms of manufacturing, logistics, and manpower arrangements for tool installation; (2) significant fluctuation in TSMC customers’ demands for certain products, leading to uncertainties for TSMC’s capacity planning and also for meeting customers’ demand, which may harm TSMC’s business with customers and subject TSMC to risks of legal disputes; and (3) potential production delays for TSMC’s products due to forced factory or office closures or partial operation.The Company has implemented various measures to address the abovementioned risks, including but not limited to, health management of TSMC’s employees, management of production inventory, supply chain risk management, and capacity management for demand changes. TSMC has formed an “Epidemic Prevention Committee” to identify, implement and monitor such actions as required by the dynamic exigencies arising from the pandemic. As of the date of this annual report, TSMC’s current business and results of operations have not been materially affected by the pandemic, partially due to such trends as work-from-home and distance learning emerged to help accelerate the digital transformation. However, there is no certainty that the measures the Company has taken will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by COVID-19, and TSMC’s ability to perform critical functions and to meet customers’ needs could be materially adversely affected.TSMC maintains a comprehensive risk management system dedicated to the safety of people, the conservation of natural resources and the protection of property. In order to cope effectively with emergencies and natural disasters, management at each facility has developed comprehensive plans and procedures that focus on risk prevention, emergency response, crisis management and business continuity. All TSMC manufacturing fabs have been ISO 14001 certified (environmental management system) and ISO 45001 certified (occupational health and safety management system). All manufacturing fabs in Taiwan have also been TOSHMS (Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System) certified. New fabs will also attain the above certifications within 18 months after acquiring factory registration certification.TSMC has further strengthened its business continuity plans, which include periodic risk assessment, risk mitigation, and implementation through the establishment of emergency taskforces when necessary, combined with the preparation of a thorough analysis of an emergency, its impact, alternative actions, and solutions for each possible scenario together with appropriate precautionary and/or recovery measures. Each taskforce is given the responsibility of ensuring TSMC’s ability to minimize personal injury, business disruption and financial impact under the circumstances. TSMC periodically reviews its business continuity plans and revise it according to exercise results and implementation.In response to the impact of the earthquake that occurred in Taiwan, TSMC continued to improve its earthquake emergency response, tool anchorage and seismic isolation facilities, and readiness for tool salvage and production recovery. These improvements have also been integrated into new fab design. TSMC business continuity procedures were further enhanced through the compliance with ISO 22301.TSMC and many of its suppliers use combustible and toxic materials in their manufacturing processes and are therefore subject to risks that cannot be completely eliminated arising from explosion, fire, or environmental influences. Although the Company maintains many overlapping risk prevention and protection systems, as well as fire and casualty insurance, TSMC’s risk management and insurance coverage may not always be sufficient to cover all of the Company’s potential losses. If any of TSMC’s fabs or vendor facilities were to be damaged or cease operations as a result of an explosion, 122123fire or environmental causes, it could reduce the Company’s manufacturing capacity leading to the loss of important sales and customers and as a negative impact on TSMC’s financial performance. In addition to periodic fire-protection inspections and firefighting drills, the Company has also carried out a corporate-wide fire risk mitigation project focused on managerial and hardware improvements.6.3.6  Risks Regarding Non-Compliance with Export Control, Environmental and Climate Change Related Laws, Regulations and Accords, and Failure to Timely Obtain Requisite Approvals Necessary for Conducting BusinessBecause TSMC engages in manufacturing activities in multiple jurisdictions and conducts business with its customers located worldwide, such activities are subject to a myriad of governmental regulations. For example, the manufacturing, assembling and testing of TSMC’s products require the use of metals, chemicals, and materials that are subject to environmental, climate-related, health and safety, and humanitarian conflict-free sourcing laws, regulations and guidelines issued worldwide.The Company’s failure to comply with any such laws or regulations, as amended from time to time, and its failure to comply with any information and document sharing requests from the relevant authorities in a timely manner could result in:●significant penalties and legal liabilities, such as the denial of import or export permits or third-party private lawsuits, criminal or administrative proceedings;●the temporary or permanent suspension of production of the affected products;●unfavorable in alterations in TSMC’s manufacturing, fabrication and assembly and test processes;●challenges from its customers that place TSMC at a significant competitive disadvantage, such as loss of actual or potential sales contracts in case the Company is unable to satisfy the applicable legal standard or customer requirement;●restrictions on TSMC’s operations or sales;●loss of tax benefits, including termination of current tax incentives, disqualification of tax credit application and repayment of the tax benefits that the Company is not entitled to; and●damages to TSMC’s goodwill and reputation.Complying with applicable laws and regulations, such as environmental and climate related laws and regulations, could also require TSMC, among other things, to do the following: (1) purchase, use or install remedial equipment; (2) implement remedial programs such as climate change mitigation programs; (3) modify its product designs and manufacturing processes, or incur other significant expenses such as obtaining substitute raw materials or chemicals that may cost more or be less available for the Company’s operations.TSMC’s inability to timely obtain approvals necessary for the conduct of its business could impair its operational and financial results. For example, if the Company is unable to timely obtain environmental related approvals needed to undertake the development and construction of a new fab or expansion project, then such inability may delay, limit, or increase the cost of its expansion plans that could also in turn adversely affect its business and operational results. In light of increased public interest in environmental issues, TSMC’s operations and expansion plans may be adversely affected or delayed responding to public concern and social environmental pressures even if the Company complies with all applicable laws and regulations.TSMC believes that climate change should be regarded as a significant corporate risk that must be controlled to improve competitiveness. For TSMC’s climate change related risks and control measures, see the Climate Change and Energy Management section under “7.2.1 Environmental Protection“ on page 131-132 of this annual report.6.3.7 Other RisksPotential Impact and Risks Associated with Sales of Significant Numbers of Shares by TSMC’s Directors, and/or Major Shareholders Who Own 10% or More of TSMC’s Total Outstanding SharesThe value of TSMC shareholders’ investment may be reduced by possible future sales of TSMC shares owned by major shareholders.As of the date of this annual report, no single shareholder owned 10% or more of TSMC’s total outstanding shares.Risks of Trade PoliciesAs TSMC’s revenue is primarily derived from sales to major economies in the world (please refer to “2.2.4 TSMC Position, Differentiation and Strategy” on page 15-17 of this annual report), any changes in the trade policies (such as the increase of tariffs on certain products, the implementation of import and export controls, and the adoption of other trade barriers) of such major economies can affect the sales of TSMC or its customers and thereby affect TSMC’s operating results. TSMC continues to monitor the recent shifts in trade policies and measures among the relevant major economies and will take corresponding responsive actions in accordance with subsequent developments.In May 2020 and again in August 2020, the U.S. tightened its export control measures against Huawei Technology Co. Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, “Huawei”), including an expanded license requirement for providing Huawei with items subject to the U.S. export control jurisdiction. To comply with relevant laws and regulations, we have discontinued shipment of products to Huawei since September 15, 2020. On the other hand, measures adopted by an affected country to counteract impacts of another country’s actions or regulations could lead to significant legal liability to multinational corporations including our own. For example, in January 2021, China adopted a blocking statute that, among other matters, entitles Chinese entities incurring damages from a multinational’s compliance with foreign laws to seek civil remedies.As of the date of this annual report, our current results of operations have not been materially affected. Nevertheless, depending on future developments of global trade tensions, such relevant regulations, rules, or measures may have an adverse impact on our business and operations, and we may incur significant legal liability and financial losses as a result.TSMC continues to monitor the recent shifts in trade policies and measures among the relevant major economies and will take corresponding responsive actions in accordance with subsequent developments.Other Material RisksIn 2020 and as of the date of this annual report, TSMC’s management was not aware of any other risk that could have a potentially material impact on the financial status of the Company.1241251241251261277.1 OverviewThe Company’s four core values of integrity, commitment, innovation, and customer trust remain as the core values of TSMC’s culture. As the world’s leading semiconductor foundry and a trusted technology and capacity provider, TSMC seeks, in addition to continued success in its business endeavors, to fulfill its ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) management. For TSMC these responsibilities fall into three primary missions: acting with integrity, strengthening environmental protection and caring for the disadvantaged. For each of these missions the Company has established concrete, measurable long-term goals, as well as corresponding action plans to review and correct periodically, consistently creating value for all stakeholders.Guidance for the Implementation of ESGTSMC’s “ESG Policy” is the overarching guiding principle for sustainable development. The “ESG Matrix” set by the Company’s founder Dr. Morris Chang, clearly defines the scope of TSMC’s ESG responsibility. The horizontal axis shows the seven areas where TSMC strives to demonstrate its ESG commitment: morality, business ethics, economy, rule of law, sustainability, work/life balance and happiness, and philanthropy. On the vertical axis are actions that TSMC has taken to fulfill these responsibilities.TSMC ESG MatrixSocietyTSMC MoralityBusiness EthicsEconomyRule of LawSustainabilityWork/Life Balance HappinessPhilanthropyIntegrity VVLaw Compliance VAnti-Corruption Anti-Bribery Anti-CronyismVVVEnvironmental Protection Climate Control Energy Conservation VVCorporate Governance VVVProvide Well-Paying Jobs VVGood Shareholder Return VEmployees’ Work-Life Balance VEncourage Innovation VVGood Work Environment VTSMC Charity Foundation VVVTSMC Education and Culture Foundation VVVESG ManagementIn compliance with the vision and missions of TSMC’s ESG Policy, the ESG Steering Committee serves as the highest-level ESG decision-making center within the Company and is committed to aligning TSMC more closely with international sustainability trends. TSMC’s Chairman chairs the ESG Steering Committee, and the Chairperson of the ESG Committee serves as Executive Secretary. Together with senior executives from a wide variety of functions, they survey the Company’s core operating capabilities, set the medium- to long-term strategic direction for ESG, and draft the blueprint to link the Company’s core competencies with the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs).The Company’s ESG Committee serves as a cross-departmental communication platform. Through quarterly meetings and issue-based discussions by cross-organizational teams, the committee members jointly set the Company’s ESG strategies, identify key issues for the year, draft ESG-related budgets for their organizations and coordinate resource deployment, as well as plan and carry out annual projects. The Committee pursues sustainability objectives of interest to all stakeholders and ensures ESG strategies are implemented effectively in the Company’s daily operations.The Chairperson of the ESG Committee reports quarterly to the Board of Directors on implementation results and the work planned in the future. In 2020, TSMC focused on strengthening renewable energy adoption, driving in-house reuse rate of resources to realize circular economics, applying circular economy, and launching the TSMC Urban Greenery Project. To build a sustainable supply chain, the Company implemented a signed supplier code of conduct, performed supplier risk assessments and launched Supply Online 360, a Global responsible supply chain management platform, to extend TSMC’s high operational standards. The Company also created an inclusive workplace by piloting a “Psychological Safety” program to enable open communication and develop semiconductor talent and support through STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education. To have a positive social impact, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation and the TSMC Charity Foundation also actively support and promote youth development, culture and art, and care for the disadvantaged.Stakeholder EngagementTSMC respects all stakeholder rights. To understand the level of interest in sustainability issues, TSMC uses multiple systematic channels to communicate with stakeholders, including the “Contact Us” section of the corporate website, the ESG website and the ESG mailbox, the Irregular Business Conduct Reporting System, as well as the new Supply Chain Worker Grievance Channel, established in 2020. TSMC has conducted three studies focused on identification, prioritization and validation with regard to these issues.In 2020, the TSMC ESG mailbox received 445 valid emails on subjects ranging from corporate governance, innovation and services, to supply chain management, green manufacturing, inclusive workplace, and social investments. Submissions were primarily regarding requests for inquiries on operations, proposals for donations and collaborations, opinion and feedback from the public and visits. TSMC responded through direct action from related departments and timely replies from the public relations department, supporting communication with the public as well as positive development in society.Stakeholders and Communication Channels in 2020StakeholdersCommunication ChannelsEmployees●Communications and working meetings throughout all levels and all units of the Company●Corporate

The Company knows that the future is filled with challenges but it will always stay true to its cornerstones of – integrity and responsible operations. TSMC has chosen nine major United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), drafted 2030 long-term goals, and implemented sustainable approaches accordingly. With Goal 17 of the SDG – global partnerships – at the core, TSMC collaborates with stakeholders inside and outside the Company as well as with business partners along the value chain. Through participation, cooperation, and dialogue, TSMC actively creates sustainable values in the governance/economy, the environment and society for its stakeholders, and has become the only semiconductor company chosen for the Dow Jones Sustainability World Indices over the past 20 consecutive years.1301317.2  Environmental, Safety and Health (ESH) ManagementTSMC believes its environmental, safety and health practices must not only meet legal requirements, but should also align with internationally recognized best practices. The Company’s ESH policies aim to achieve “zero incident” and “environmental sustainability” and to make TSMC a world-class organization in environmental, safety and health management. The Company’s strategies for attaining these goals are to comply with regulations, promote safety and health, strengthen recycling and pollution prevention, manage ESH risks, instill an ESH culture, establish a green supply chain, and fulfill its related corporate social responsibilities.All TSMC manufacturing facilities have received ISO 14001: 2015 certification for environmental management systems and ISO 45001: 2018 certification for occupational safety and health management systems. All fabs in Taiwan have been TOSHMS (Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System) certified since 2009. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) released the latest version of ISO 45001: 2018 to replace OHSAS 18001 in March 2018. All TSMC fabs in Taiwan received ISO 45001: 2018 certification in August 2019. All TSMC subsidiaries obtained certification in 2020.TSMC strives for continuous improvement and actively seeks to enhance climate-change management, pollution prevention and control, power and resource conservation, waste reduction and recycling, safety and health management, fire and explosion prevention as well as to minimize the impact of earthquake damage, so as to reduce overall environmental, safety and health risks.In order to meet regulatory and customer requirements for the management of hazardous materials, TSMC has adopted the IECQ QC 080000 Hazardous Substance Process Management (HSPM) System. All TSMC manufacturing facilities have been QC 080000 certified since 2007. Through the establishment of QC 080000, TSMC ensures that its products comply with international regulatory and customer requirements, including the European Union’s “Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive,” the EU’s “Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH),” the “Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer,” the “halogen-free in electronic products” initiative, Perfluorooctane Sulfonates (PFOS), Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) and its related substances restriction standards. TSMC collaborates with suppliers to improve the sustainability of the Company’s supply chain regarding ESH-related issues, such as environmental protection, compliance of safety and hygiene codes, hazardous substance management, fire protection, and mitigation of natural disaster. The Company not only performs ESH audits at its suppliers’ manufacturing sites, but also proactively assists them to improve ESH performance.In addition, TSMC monitors potential climate-change related risks in the supply chain. The Company requests that suppliers conduct carbon emissions inventory and encourages them to implement measures to save energy, reduce carbon emissions, conserve water and reduce waste.In recent years, TSMC suppliers have made excellent progress in procedure establishment and implementation for pollution control and safety management. To take it a step further, the Company has given greater attention to occupational hygiene issues directly related to labor health. In 2017, TSMC and the Ministry of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OHSA) jointly launched the “Semiconductor Supply Chain Safety and Health Promotion Project”. TSMC also invited suppliers to participate in the project. As engaged by OSHA, a professional team has taken on the responsibility of providing consultation through document review and onsite inspection to participating suppliers on management procedures and hardware setup in order to improve the working environment and labor health management.7.2.1 Environmental ProtectionClimate Change and Energy Management●Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)Given that climate change could potentially affect operations and pose financial risk, in 2018 TSMC adopted recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) released by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to identify risk and opportunities, and further established metrics and target management based on the identification results.Management Structure of TSMC Climate-related Risk and OpportunityCategoryManagement Strategy and ActionsGovernanceBoard of Directors periodically reviews climate change related risk and opportunity●ESG Steering Committee led by Chairman is the Company’s top organization that deals with climate change management. The chairperson of ESG Committee serves as the Executive Secretary. ESG Steering Committee reviews TSMC’s climate change strategies and goals every six months and reports to the Board of Directors. (The Corporate Social Responsibility Executive Committee has been renamed as ESG Steering Committee in 2021. The frequency of regular meetings has been increased from semi-annual to quarterly.)●The Energy and Carbon Reduction Committee led by the senior vice presidents of Fab operations is the organization that deals with action implementation of climate change risk and opportunity in TSMC. This committee develops management plans, reviews the execution status and discusses future plans on a quarterly basis.StrategyIdentify short, medium and long term climate risks and opportunities through cross-departmental discussionAssess the potential operational and financial impact of significant climate risks and opportunities to the companyConduct situational analysis, evaluate SBT and net-zero emissionRisk ManagementUse of the TCFD framework to establish TSMC’s climate risk identification processFollow the risk identification and ranking on climate change to develop relevant responding projectsIntegrate climate risk identification and assessment into the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) processMetrics and TargetsSet management metrics related to climate changeExamine the impact on company operations and assess the risks and mitigation strategies for scope 1, 2 and 3 through annual inventory of ISO 14064-1 and disclosure of greenhouse gas emissionsDevelop climate change management objectives and review achievement progress and actual performanceIn addition, TSMC started a project for reducing usage of hazardous substance N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) in 2016. NMP unit product usage has been reduced 59% by 2020 comparing to 2016, and the project will continue promoting for further reduction.Since 2011, TSMC has adopted the ISO 50001 Energy Management System for the continuous improvement in energy conservation. In 2019, all TSMC fabs in Taiwan received ISO 50001 Energy Management System certification, and all TSMC overseas subsidiaries scheduled to receive the certification in 2019 have had their certifications postponed to 2021 due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.Aiming to establish the healthiest possible workplace, in 2017 TSMC formed a corporate-level health promotion committee led by managers at the vice president level. The committee members include site directors, managers of safety and health department, and representatives from wellness, HR and legal affairs divisions. External experts have also been invited to discuss the potential risks of occupational diseases in the semiconductor manufacturing process and prevention plans for such diseases. To mitigate health risks to employees, suppliers and contractors in the workplace, TSMC has adopted rigorous safety and health control measures focused on preventing occupational injuries and diseases and promoting employee safety, physical and mental health.To mitigate the supply chain risk and fulfill corporate social responsibility, TSMC not only follows ESH best practices internally but also strives to improve the ESH performance of its suppliers and contractors through audits and counseling.TSMC uses priority work management and self-management to govern services provided by contractors. The Company requires contractors performing level-one high-risk operations to complete certification for technicians and to establish their own ISO 45001 safety and health management system. The promotion of self-management aims at improving sense of responsibility, with the goal of promoting safety awareness and technical improvement for all contractors in the industry. For onsite contractor personnel, TSMC has standardized courses on safety and health and increased the frequency of such courses to improve training effectiveness and safety awareness. To ensure the Company’s safety protocols are accurately delivered to contractors on a timely basis, TSMC has established a digital platform for mutual communication so that onsite operational risks can be mitigated.132133come from electricity consumption, TSMC always emphasizes energy conservation and carbon reduction initiatives. TSMC has not only implemented energy-conserving designs in its manufacturing fabs and offices but has also continuously improved the energy efficiency of its facilities during operation. These efforts simultaneously reduce both carbon dioxide gas emissions and costs. TSMC has accumulated 1.7 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) power conservation since 2016.From 2015 to 2017, TSMC voluntarily participated in the Republic of China Ministry of Economic Affairs’ green power purchasing program for three consecutive years and became the largest buyer in Taiwan, purchasing 400 million kilowatt hours of green power. Although the Taiwan Power Company stopped selling green power in 2018, TSMC still aggressively negotiates the purchase of renewable energy with renewable energy suppliers in Taiwan. Targeting a long-term commitment of 100% renewable energy for the Company, TSMC is first committed to achieving a target of 25% renewable energy for fabs and 100% renewable energy for non-fab facilities by 2030. Since 2018, the overseas manufacturing fabs and offices have purchased renewable energy, REC and carbon credits to offset all carbon emissions caused by power consumption. All TSMC overseas sites achieved zero carbon emission of electricity consumption in 2020 again. TSMC also used carbon credits to offset Carbon emissions of natural gas consumption in kitchens, achieving the milestone of net zero emission for TSMC global offices. Although development of renewable energy in Taiwan is in an early stage, TSMC established a renewable energy task force and continued to communicate closely with government through the Association of Science Park Industries and Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association. The Company made recommendations to the government in the hope that the collaboration could speed up renewable energy development in Taiwan. The recommendations included expanding the development of offshore wind power and increasing supply of renewable energy trading platform. TSMC also continued to find renewable energy. By the end of 2020, the total installation capacity of renewable energy contracted reached 1.3GW (Gigawatts). The renewable energy will be provided to TSMC gradually after related business process being completed. This is a clear manifestation of the Company’s active support of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).TSMC became the first semiconductor company to join RE100 (Global Renewable Energy Initiative) in July 2020 and pledged that power consumption of all the Company’s manufacturing plants and offices will be 100% supplied from renewable energy by 2050. TSMC was further awarded the first RE100 Leadership Award - the Most Impactful Pioneer in September 2020 for being the first to purchase large amounts of renewable electricity in Taiwan and taking practical action to support green energy.Air and Water Pollution ControlThe Company has installed effective air and water pollution control equipment in each wafer fab to meet regulatory emissions standards. In addition, TSMC maintains backup pollution control systems, including emergency power supplies, to lower the risk of pollutant emissions in the event of equipment failure. The Company centrally monitors the operations of its air and water pollution control equipment around the clock and treats system effectiveness as an important tracking item to ensure the quality of emitted air and discharged water.To make the most effective use of Taiwan’s limited water resources, all TSMC fabs strive to increase water reclamation rates by adjusting the water usage of manufacturing equipment and improving wastewater reclamation systems. All fabs meet or exceed the process water reclamation rate standard of the Science Park Administration. Some fabs are able to reclaim more than 90% of process water, outperforming most semiconductor fabs around the world. TSMC also makes every effort to reduce non-manufacturing-related water consumption, including water used in air conditioning systems, sanitary facilities, wall cleaning and landscaping activities and kitchens. TSMC uses an intranet website to collect and measure water recycling volumes company-wide.Since water resources are inherently local, TSMC shares its water saving experiences with other semiconductor companies through the Association of Science-Based Industrial Park to promote water conservation in order to achieve the Science Park’s goals and ensure a long-term balance of supply and demand. In addition, TSMC has committed to using partially reclaimed water in newly constructed fabs in the future in order to further reuse water resources and support government policy and promotion for reclaimed water.To continue enhancing water resources management, TSMC has adopted and followed the AWS Standard, the world’s only sustainable water management standard. Early in 2019, Fab 6 and Fab 14 Phase 5/6/7 began serving as demonstration factories and received AWS certification by the end of the year, making TSMC the first semiconductor enterprise to receive AWS platinum level certification in the world. In 2020, Fab 15A and Fab 15B, located in Central Taiwan Science Park, passed third party verification audit and obtained AWS platinum level certification simultaneously.Financial Impact Analysis of Climate Risks and OpportunitiesClimate RisksPotential Financial ImpactClimate OpportunitiesPotential Financial Impact2020 ActionsGHG emissions cap and carbon tax/carbon feeRestriction on capacity expansion, increase in operation costs●Participation in renewable energy plans●Participation in carbon trading marketEarly purchases of renewable energy, successfully increasing production capacity●TSMC’s power purchasing agreements for renewable energy totaled 1.3 GW (Gigawatts)●Purchased 1,230 GWh in renewable energy, renewable energy certificates (REC), and carbon credit to offset 100% of the electricity carbon emissions of our overseas subsidiaries, global offices and offices.Trend of net zero emission●Increased cost of installation and operation for carbon reduction facilities●Increased cost of purchasing carbon offset productsWin public recognition and Carbon emission offset cooperationAccumulate carbon credits in preparation for future Carbon emission offset●Passed the application for Fluorinated-Greenhouse Gas and Nitrous Oxide reduction offset project reward●TSMC Global Offices used Carbon Credit to achieve Net Zero EmissionDevelop low-carbon product service to upgrade product energy efficiencySatisfy customers’ needs of energy-saving products and increase revenue●Involved the production of 5nm energy saving productionCommitment of EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment)The expansion of advanced technologies would be hampered by the lack of success in obtaining renewable energy and reclaimed waterUse reclaimed waterSmooth construction of advanced production lines●Started the construction of TSMC reclaimed water plant in Southern Taiwan Science ParkUncertainty of development of new energy saving technologyRaising of electricity consumption of advance technology production line leads to increase of production costConstruct green buildingsLower utility costs●Applied and received 2 green building certificationsImpact on the Company’s reputationUnable to satisfy the expectations of stakeholders, impacting the Company’s reputation Increase company’s reputationUpgrade the performance of stakeholders’ sustainability ranking●Leads the industry as the only semiconductor company chosen for the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI) for 20 consecutive years●TSMC ranked as one of CDP Change Climate and Water Security LeadersFloodProduction affected, causing financial losses and a decrease in revenueIncrease resilience against natural disastersStrengthen climate resilience, lower risk of operations disruption, and reduce potential losses●Raised the building base of Fab 18 Phase 2 two meters higher●Fab 18 Phase 3 is committed to using and developing reclaimed water●Established a comprehensive water monitoring systemDroughtIncreasing of premium of natural disasterIncrease in operation costRising temperatures Increase in electricity consumption, cost, and carbon emissionsDrive low-carbon green manufacturingSave energy and cut cost●Conserved 500 GWh of electricity through energy-saving projectsGreenhouse Gas (GHG) Emission Reduction and Energy ManagementTSMC actively participates in the World Semiconductor Council (WSC) in its efforts to establish a global voluntary PFC (perfluorinated compounds) emissions reduction goal for the decade of 2011 to 2020, and has incorporated past experience to develop best practices. The implementation of best practices has been adopted by the WSC as a major element of the 2020 goal. In 2013, in accordance with the “EPA Early Actions for Carbon Credit of Greenhouse Gases Reduction” regulation, TSMC applied for the recognition of greenhouse gas reduction from 2005 to 2011, and received 5.28 million tons of carbon dioxide credits in 2015. Those carbon credits can be used to offset greenhouse gas emissions of new manufacturing facilities regulated by Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Act, which can support the Company’s sustainable operations and mitigate climate-change risk.Since 2005, TSMC has completed the GHG (Greenhouse Gas) inventory program and taken a complete inventory of its GHG emissions to gain ISO 14064 certification. The inventory shows that the major direct GHG emissions are PFCs, which are widely used in the semiconductor manufacturing process. The primary indirect GHG emission is electricity consumption. The analysis of the inventory data is not only to meet domestic regulatory reporting requirements but also to serve as a baseline reference for TSMC’s strategy to reduce GHG emissions. Since 2005, TSMC participated the international organization “Carbon Disclosure Program, CDP” to publicly disclose climate change related information every year. In 2020, TSMC was recognized by CDP as A- and A leadership level for climate change and water security respectively.In response to the commitment of global climate summit “Paris Agreement” and the Republic of China’s “Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act” promulgated in 2015, TSMC initiated a cross-functional platform for corporate carbon management in 2016. The three areas of focus of this platform are legal compliance, carbon emission reduction, and carbon credit acquisition. In addition to participating in official regulatory consultation and communications meetings, TSMC also sets short, medium and long-term reduction targets through the energy and carbon reduction committee led by senior vice presidents which are carried out by energy and carbon reduction teams of individual fabs. Because more than 75% of TSMC’s GHG emissions 134135Waste Management and RecyclingThe Company has a designated unit responsible for waste recycling and disposal. To meet the goal of sustainable resource utilization, TSMC’s priorities are: process waste reduction, onsite regeneration and reuse, and offsite recycling. The last option consists of treatment or disposal. To achieve raw material reduction, resource recycling and the goal of zero waste, for example, the Company built an in-house waste sulfuric acid pre-treatment system, as electronic grade sulfuric acid can be used as a waste water treatment agent after the wafer fabrication process. In order to track waste flow and ensure that all waste is treated or recycled legally and properly, TSMC carefully selects waste disposal and recycling contractors. All recycling contractors must report their recycled product sales monthly. The Company performs regular onsite audits to check factory status and review the reported data with actual reuse and recycling data to assure that the recycled product is flowing downstream properly. TSMC checks their licenses and on-site operational statuses, and also takes proactive steps to strengthen vendor auditing effectiveness. For example, all waste transportation contractors have been asked and agreed to join the GPS Satellite Fleet so that the cleanup transportation routes and abnormal stays for all trucks can be traced. In addition, all waste recycling and treatment vendors have installed closed-circuit TV systems at operating sites to monitor and audit waste handling. Meanwhile, TSMC also conducts an ongoing survey of recycled product tracking, actions taken to ensure lawful and proper waste recycling and treatment.In 2020, TSMC’s fabs in Taiwan achieved a 95% waste recycling rate for the sixth consecutive year, with a landfill rate below 1% for the eleventh consecutive year. In 2017, TSMC amended its articles of incorporation to add four business items for chemical materials to ensure waste flow and reduce risks of improper waste disposal by commissioned agencies. TSMC also set up onsite resource activation facilities to convert waste resources produced from processing activities into products to be used onsite or to sell to other factories. In 2020, the Company not only achieved zero outsourcing treatment of copper-containing liquid waste and cobalt-containing liquid waste, and zero purchasing of 50% concentration industrial-grade sulfuric acid but also extended its ammonium sulfate drying system, which converts biologically toxic ammonia wastewater into industrial grade ammonium sulfate as valuable recycled products for sale. As a result, TSMC has become a leader in waste resources regeneration.Environmental AccountingThe purpose of TSMC’s environmental accounting system is to identify and calculate environmental costs for internal management. At the same time, the Company can also evaluate the savings or economic benefits of environmental protection programs so as to promote economically-effective programs. While environmental expenses are expected to continue growing, environmental accounting can help manage these costs more effectively. TSMC’s environmental accounting measures various environmental costs, establishes independent environmental account codes, and provides the data to all units for use in annual budgeting. The Company’s economic benefit evaluation calculates cost savings for reduction of energy, water or waste and benefits from waste recycling in accordance with its environmental protection programs.The environmental benefits disclosed in this report include real income from projects such as waste recycling and savings from major environmental projects. In 2020, the total benefits of environmental protection programs of TSMC fabs including waste recycling exceeded NT$2,430 million.2020 Environmental Cost of TSMC Fabs in TaiwanUnit: NT$ thousandsClassificationDescriptionExpenseInvestment1.

All TSMC fabs in Taiwan have received TOSHMS (Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System) certification since 2009. In 2018, the International Organization for Standardization released ISO 45001: 2018, replacing OHSAS 18001, with major changes in the expansion of the scope, support and participation of the leadership, collection and planning of internal and external issues, expectation and demand of stakeholders, evaluation of risk inspection, communication and consultation of non-managers, application of performance indicator, and evaluation of corrective and preventive action. Meanwhile, ISO 45001 ensures the spirit of the system can be effectively implemented at the management level through management review, internal audit, automatic check, and security patrol to find safety concerns and opportunities for improvement. All fabs in Taiwan received ISO 45001 certification for occupational health and safety in 2019 and all TSMC subsidiaries obtained the certification in 2020.Besides accident prevention, TSMC has established emergency response procedures to protect employees and contractors if a disaster should occur, as well as to prevent and/or reduce the negative impact on the community and the environment. TSMC communicates regularly with suppliers to ensure that potential risk in the operation of production equipment is minimized and that safety control procedures are followed rigorously during installation. The Company places stringent controls on high-risk operations and also evaluates the seismic tolerance of its facilities and equipment to reduce the risk of earthquake damage.For epidemics, TSMC has established corporate-level prevention committees and procedures for emergency response to outbreaks of infectious diseases.Working Environment and Employee Safety and Health ProtectionThe Company’s ESH policy is focused on establishing a safe working environment, preventing occupational injury and illness, keeping employees healthy, enhancing every employee’s awareness and sense of accountability to ESH, and building an ESH culture. TSMC safety and health management operations apply to the following:●Equipment Safety and Health Management In addition to meeting regulatory requirements and internal standards, as well as mitigating ESH-related risks when building or expanding facilities, TSMC also maintains procedures governing new equipment and raw materials, requires safety approvals for bringing new tools online, updates safety rules, and implements seismic protection and other safety measures.TSMC requires that all new tools meet SEMI-S8 requirements and that appropriate supplementary control measures be taken to reduce ergonomic risk. Moreover, the Company endeavors to automate 300mm front-opening unified pod (FOUP) transportation to prevent accumulative physical damage caused by repetitive manual handling of 300mm FOUPs. TSMC 300mm fabs have completed automatic transportation control.●Environmental, Safety and Health Evaluation of New Tools and New Chemical Substances As a technology leader in the global semiconductor industry, TSMC operates increasingly diversified process tools and introduces new chemicals in the R&D stage. Before using new tools or new chemicals, they are reviewed carefully by the new tools and new chemical review committee. The purpose is to ensure that new tools are compliant with the semiconductor industry’s safety standards (such as SEMI-S2) and that new chemicals’ environmental, safety and health concerns can be well controlled, including engineering controls, application of personal protection equipment, and operational safety training during storage, transportation, usage and disposal.●General Safety Management, Training and AuditAll TSMC manufacturing facilities hold environmental, safety and health committee meetings on a monthly basis. TSMC has adopted multiple preventive measures such as controls on high-risk work, contractor management, chemical safety management, personal protective equipment requirements, and safety audit management. In addition, the Company maintains detailed disaster response procedures and performs regular drills designed to minimize damage to employees and property, as well as the impact on society and the environment in the event of a disaster.●Working Environment Hazardous Factors Management TSMC conducts workplace hazard assessments to provide a comfortable, safe workplace to employees. The Company also educates and requires employees to use personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent hazardous exposures.The Company performs semi-annual workplace environment assessments of physical and chemical hazards, including CO2 concentration, illumination, noise, and hazardous chemical substances regulated by local laws. In addition, TSMC has performed exposure assessments and has used hierarchy management control for chemicals with potential health hazards. If abnormal measurements occur, events happen, or an exposure assessment indicates there is an adverse health effect for employees, ESH professionals immediately conduct onsite observation and intervention to reduce the exposure to acceptable levels.●Health Promotion ProgramIn order to establish the healthiest possible workplace and reduce the incidence of occupational disease, TSMC formed a corporate-level committee to execute health promotion programs covering three key areas:(1)  Exposure and health risk assessment: develop an exposure assessment system to identify high health risk employees.(2)   Hazardous training and notification: use standardized training materials for employees and contractors in all TSMC fabs. Inform them of the health risks and prevention measures at the workplace before working or providing any services there.(3)  Strengthen management of chemicals with significant health risks: inform suppliers that all materials they provide to TSMC must comply with applicable laws including clear disclosure of any hazardous substances. Perform sampling of raw materials used in the manufacturing process to confirm that they do not contain any carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic-reproductive materials as claimed in supplier’s safety data sheet (SDS). ●Emergency ResponseThe planning and execution of an effective emergency response should identify potential high-risk events via risk assessment and be prepared for various scenarios. It should focus on continuous improvement and drills covering all potentially serious events. TSMC’s emergency response plans include procedures for rapid-response crisis management and disaster recovery for all potential incidents.All TSMC fabs conduct major annual emergency response exercises and evacuation drills. TSMC’s onsite service contractors are also required to participate in emergency response planning and exercises to ensure cooperation in handling accidents and to effectively minimize any damage caused by disasters. At least every two years, each fab director invites fab management and support functions to participate in business continuity drills for potentially high-risk events such as earthquake, fire and flood (Tainan site). Since 2018, TSMC has conducted complex accident emergency response drills, which include simultaneous scenarios for earthquake, fire and chemical spills. In 2019, the Company completed 108 scenarios to ensure rapid response to emergencies so that losses can be minimized in the event of a real disaster. In 2020, TSMC took lead in the industry to introduce the “All-Hazard” approach recommended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to conduct disaster prevention exercises.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, TSMC added tabletop exercises to disaster prevention training in an effort to minimize the risks of group infections that may arise as a result of full-scale exercises. The inclusion of tabletop exercises also aids in the verification of full-scale exercise procedures to make disaster response more comprehensive, thus effectively mitigating the impact of various types of disasters on business continuity in the future. As of October 2020, 75 sessions of tabletop exercises had been completed in addition to 195 full-scale exercises.In addition to the regular emergency response drills held by engineering and facilities departments each quarter, the Company’s laboratory, canteen, dormitory, and shuttle bus personnel also hold emergency response drills to prepare for events such as earthquakes, chemical spills, ammonia release, fires and traffic accidents.●Emerging Infectious Disease ResponseTSMC has a dedicated corporate ESH organization to monitor emerging infectious diseases around the world, to assess any potential impact on the workplace, and to provide an appropriate strategic response plan. In previous outbreaks such as SARS in 2003, H1N1 influenza in 2009, and MERS in 2015, as well as with the current COVID-19 threat, TSMC followed the Taiwan CDC’s (Centers for Disease Control) rules and convened the corporate influenza response committee to develop the Company’s strategies. These strategies included educating employees in prevention and response, publishing guidelines for managers, establishing guidelines for 140141employee sick leave due to flu, and installing alcohol-based hand sanitizers at appropriate locations. The Committee also monitors the status of employee leave due to illness and, at the same time, develops a continuity plan to address manpower shortages and minimize business impact.●Employee Physical and Mental Health EnhancementTSMC believes that employees’ physical and mental health is not only fundamental to maintaining normal business operations but is also part of a corporation’s responsibility. To protect and promote employee physical and mental health, TSMC fosters collaboration among the onsite industrial safety and environmental protection department, onsite medical personnel of the health center, and physicians of occupational medicine. TSMC strives to reduce cerebral and cardiovascular disease that might be induced or aggravated by overwork, night work or shift work. The Company conducts maternal health protection programs and prevention of cumulative trauma disorders as well. TSMC devotes significant resources to mental health awareness and related activities, which not only protect employees from hazards at work but also proactively promote employee health in general. In 2020, through planned personal health management, (1) 599 female employees participated in the maternal health program, the completion rate was 100%. 598 of them were at the first degree risk (there was no harm to the mother, infant, and baby). One employee was classified as second degree risk (possible harm to the mother, infant, and baby) at the first assessment; after proper adjustments to her works, she was reclassified as the first degree after doctor’s re-assessment. (2) By analyzing historical cerebral and cardiovascular cases of our employees, TSMC modified disease assessment criteria with contracted doctors, and, combining internal annual health examination reports, as well as working hour’s information, was able to identify 2,678 employees that have middle to high risk for cerebral and cardiovascular diseases. These employees were provided with health education and medical assistance. Also, along with their managers, they received suggested working hour recommendations to reduce disease risk. (3) 174 employees were identified in a high risk group for cumulative trauma disorders. Among them, one could have job-related risks. The Company has adjusted whose job conditions to avoid possible risks. (4) As obesity has been considered as a precursor of diabetes, TSMC has held health promotion programs for several consecutive years. In 2020, considering the prevention of COVID-19 and the tendency of young generation’s preference on social and video media, TSMC conducted a series of on-line interactive activities, such as (1) 2 sessions of “Health Lecture On-line”, 809 attendees in total. (2) 3 health education videos about hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, with a total of 7,266 visits. (3) 3 sessions of on-line quiz, with respect to 3 topics of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes, with a total of 4,618 attendees. (4) 1 session of “Selection of Health Diet” of DASH diet, 1,019 participants. The feedbacks were positive to make health promotion can be continued under epidemic prevention.7.2.4 Supplier ManagementManagement AspectFor better supply chain management, TSMC is committed to communicating with and encouraging its suppliers, including contractors, to increase their quality, cost effectiveness and delivery performance, and make continuous improvement in environmental protection, safety and health. Through regular communication with senior managers, site audits and experience sharing, the Company collaborates with major suppliers and contractors to enhance partnerships and ensure continued improvement of performance and increased joint contributions to society. As noted above, contractors performing high-risk activities must lay out clearly-defined safety precautions and preventative measures. In addition, contractors working on high-risk engineering projects must establish ISO 45001 or OHSAS 18001 systems and the workers must successfully complete work-related skill training. All contractors performing high-risk activities must obtain ISO 45001 certification before the end of 2021.Supply Chain SustainabilityTSMC works with suppliers in several fields of sustainable development, such as greening the supply chain, carbon management for climate change, mitigation of fire risk, ESH management and business continuity plans in the event of a natural disaster.Since becoming a full member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) in 2015, TSMC has completed implementation of the RBA code of conduct throughout the Company by performing self-assessments at its facilities worldwide and reviewing policies and procedures in the areas of labor, health and safety, environment, ethics and management systems.To enhance supply chain sustainability and streamline risk management, the Company is committed to collaborating with its suppliers to maintain full compliance with Taiwan’s environmental, safety, health and fire protection regulations. TSMC developed a supplier’s code of conduct, which affirmed basic labor rights and standards for health, safety, environment, ethics and management systems. TSMC works with suppliers to evaluate the risk and impact on the economy, the environment, and society and to make continuous improvement. The Company has helped boost suppliers’ performance of sustainability through experience sharing and training and hopes to establish a world-class semiconductor supply chain that exceeds international standards and serves as a global benchmark.TSMC is subject to the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure rule on conflict minerals released under Rule 13p-1 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a recognized global leader in the high-tech supply chain, the Company acknowledges its corporate social responsibility to strive to procure conflict-free minerals in an effort to recognize humanitarian and ethical social principles that protect the dignity of all people. To this end, TSMC has implemented a series of compliance safeguards in accordance with leading industry practices such as adopting the due diligence framework in the OECD’s Model Supply Chain Policy for a Responsible Global Supply Chain of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High Risk Areas issued in 2011.TSMC is a strong supporter of the Responsible Business Alliance and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), which will help the Company’s suppliers source conflict-free minerals through their jointly developed Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). Since 2011, TSMC has asked its suppliers to disclose information and make timely updates on smelters and mines. The Company encourages suppliers to source minerals from facilities or smelters that have received a “conflict free” designation by a recognized industry group (such as the RBA) and also requires those who have not received such designation to become compliant with Responsible Minerals Initiative or an equivalent third party audit program. TSMC requires the use of tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold in its products that are conflict-free.TSMC will continue to conduct the supplier survey annually and require suppliers to improve and expand their disclosure to fulfill regulatory and customer requirements.

(https://www.tsmc.com/english/investorRelations/sec_filings.htm)7.3 TSMC Education and Culture FoundationIn 2020, the world was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Starting in March, many venues in Taiwan were shut down and the impact of the pandemic could be felt in every sector. In times like these, it behoves the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation to be the first to donate a hundred thermographic cameras to the Ministry of Education to be deployed at national examination locations to support education and safeguard the health of students with the power of technology. Although various programs planned by the Foundation were curtailed by COVID-prevention measures, in 2020 the Foundation invested over NT$99 million to support various educational events, art exhibitions and performances. Through continuous donations, the Foundation hopes to help reduce educational inequality and bring new ideas to the table for cultural enrichment.Working in Tandem with Educational Partners, Closing the Resource Gap between City and CountryApart from donating one hundred thermographic cameras to the Ministry of Education as part of the COVID-prevention measures on campus in Taiwan, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation works with its educational partners to reduce inequality in educational resources. Together the Foundation and its partner Junyi Academy worked to develop a series of online courses of adaptive learning titled “Critical Thinking Training,” which was a response to the implementation of General Guidelines of Curriculum Guidelines of 12-Year Basic Education. In addition, the program hosted 26 teaching workshops where teachers learned how to guide students to think logically and improve their communication skills. 518 teachers have attended the workshops and more than 120,000 people have watched them online.As well as providing online educational resources to teachers and students, the Foundation has long been committed to narrowing the gap of educational resources between schools in urban and rural areas. In 2020, it partnered with Cheng Zhi Education Foundation to assist Emei Junior High School of Hsinchu county to transition to be a KIST-inspired school. With the injection of new educational blood, the two foundations have helped change the lives of many students from schools in rural areas. The Foundation also continuously teams up with CommonWealth Education Foundation, Teach for Taiwan, and the Boyo Social Welfare Foundation. Together the 142143Foundation donates quality books and brings good teachers to schools in rural areas to narrow the educational gap between urban and rural areas. Furthermore, in 2020 the Foundation offered grants to 70 students from low-income families at five universities: National Tsing Hua University, National Central University, National Cheng Kung University, National Sun Yat-sen University, and National Chung Cheng University. In doing so, the Foundation hopes to assist the students with financial aid and encourage them to concentrate on their studies.Nurturing Young Talent, Offering a Stage for Diverse DevelopmentTo promote popular science education and nurture talents for the semiconductor industry, in 1997 TSMC subsidized the “World of Semiconductors” exhibition hall at the National Museum of Natural Science, being at the vanguard of business-supported education of popular science. For the exhibition to keep up with the times, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation updated the content of the exhibition in 2002 and again in 2011. In 2018, the Foundation initiated a third renewal project and a brand new “World of Semiconductors” was officially launched in August 2020. With the latest upgrade the exhibition hall provides more in-depth knowledge on semiconductors, adds interactive exhibitions, and increases the exhibition space. Through a multi-dimensional experience at the exhibition, visiting students and the public can broaden their knowledge of semiconductors and the industry. In the meanwhile, in order to inspire more female students to take interest in science, in 2020 the Foundation organized for the first time a “Trip of TSMC Women Scientists,” inviting students from five girls’ high schools to visit the exhibition and be given guided tours by women engineers at TSMC. These women engineers have shared with the young students the trajectory of their learning and precious work experience, thereby hoping to encourage girls at high schools not to confine themselves to any subjects and commit themselves to fields in sciences through in-person exchange.To motivate college students to pursue their dreams and encourage young people to commit to environmental sustainability, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation organized the fifth “TSMC Youth Dream Building Project” in 2020. It focuses on the theme of “circular economy” as way to advocate the importance of environmental sustainability The Foundation has long dedicated itself to promoting Chinese classic literature. In 2020, it collaborated with National Tsing Hua University on a general education course, “Pai Hsien-yung Literature Lectures: Dream of the Red Chamber”. The course hosted by Mr. Pai Hsien-yung and renowned Honglou meng specialists from abroad and in Taiwan to give lectures on various aspects of the classic. The course also invited students to explore the profoundness of Chinese literature, bringing a humanistic perspective to their education. Likewise, the Foundation-funded broadcasting program, “Lectures on the Classics on Air,” entered its 13th year. The program host, Professor Xin Yi Yun, has released an audio book, Putting A Xin’s Spin on Lao Tzu, as an approachable way for the public to experience the wisdom of Chinese philosophers from the classics. In the same vein, the 2020 “TSMC Lecture” again invited the distinguished research fellow Wang Ming-ke of the Institute of History and Philology of Academia Sinica to examine how humans have coped with fear and what measures have been taken historically to deal with pandemics. The TSMC Education and Culture Foundation has not only promoted literary talks within local communities but also posted the talks on an online channel available to the public. In doing so, the Foundation hopes to go beyond geographic borders with technology and let arts and literature comfort the restless minds during these difficult times.7.4 TSMC Charity FoundationSince its establishment in 2017, the TSMC Charity Foundation has focused on developing programs and projects relating to its four main pillar initiatives: disadvantaged care, solitary elderly care, filial piety promotion, and environmental protection. Under the leadership of Chairperson Sophie Chang, the Foundation takes a stand for disadvantaged persons, focusing on current and potential social issues, and striving to close the wealth gap in Taiwan society by enhancing education and providing emergency assistance in rural areas. This support gives disadvantaged families and children from rural areas more opportunities to improve their lives. The Foundation has also established a social welfare platform that magnifies voices from all corners of society to support social change, powers social change through charitable works, and uplift Taiwan society.The Foundation continued to expand its scope of services through charitable endeavors in 2020 and initiated many new projects related to social welfare including the following:to the public and to the younger generation. This project was open not only to the college students in Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Maoli and Tainan areas but also to those from Taichung area. In total, 102 teams of college students participated in the project. The topics of the proposals covered virtually every issue in society, ranging from creating a popular science column on semiconductors, to a wood reclaiming project, and from an anti-drug campaign to food and agriculture education. These innovative ideas greatly impressed the panel of judges. Moreover, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation continued its support for literary, calligraphic and seal-carving by young students through funding two annual competitions, i.e. the “TSMC Youth Literature Award” and the “TSMC Youth Calligraphy and Seal-Carving Competition,” which are well into their 17th and 13th years respectively. Both competitions have become the important events in their respective fields. The Foundation has also attracted public attention and interest in literature and calligraphy via the internet. The “TSMC Youth Literature Award” social platform so far has garnered over 14,000 members and one award-winning piece has been shared over 3,000 times.The TSMC Education and Culture Foundation wishes to offer a non-academic platform to young students, where through science and humanities competitions and events the students can be inspired to develop diverse interests and explore wherever their passion takes them.Advocating Online Arts and Literary Events, Calming the Restless MindDuring the second half of 2020, the pandemic situation in Taiwan was relatively under control. Thus, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation was able to sponsor a live concert in Tainan performed by the renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma and streamed it live globally. With pandemic preventive measures in place, the Foundation invited the public to the concert hall to experience the soul-soothing power of virtuoso performance. At the same time, live streaming allowed audiences all over the world to enjoy the musical feast. The Foundation also teamed up with the National Symphony Orchestra (of Taiwan) to initiate an “Education Program for Youth” project, inviting Taiwanese-Australian violinist Ray Chen to give master classes at the National Concert Hall. The classes were streamed live and broadcasted by Taiwan Public Television Service, thereby promoting music education to a wider audience. Over 73,000 people have viewed the master classes.●Disadvantaged Care: The Foundation focused on the two main initiatives for disadvantaged care –“rural education” and “support for the disadvantaged”. The Foundation provided volunteer services, building repairs, online educational materials, off-grade foods, and other assistance to educational institutions and children in rural areas, ensuring that disadvantaged groups received equal opportunities to obtain education. In 2020, the Foundation prioritized vocational education, collaborating with various enterprises to promote training and reach the goal of “providing livelihood/practical skills,” helping students from rural areas with vocational training. To help support the basic living needs of the underprivileged, the Foundation continued to visit and provide financial aid and daily supplies to high-risk disadvantaged families, providing valuable support to the already existing social welfare system.In 2020, the Foundation gave support to 62 after-school care locations benefiting a total of 4,685 students. With the dedication and knowledge of its TSMC volunteers, the Foundation created science tutorial videos to promote science experiments and education. The Foundation also collaborated with National Chiao Tung University to help 30 elementary schools in Hsinchu City that were lacking information resources to align with 2019 Curriculum Guidelines, an issue affecting 18,000 students in the city. The Foundation’s “Sending Love” programs continued to be active, and Foundation staff conducted onsite visits to identify disadvantaged families in need of financial support. The living conditions of these disadvantaged families were improved through charitable donations from both inside and outside TSMC. As of 2020, the Foundation has assisted a total of 155 families.●Solitary Elderly Care: The Foundation improved the health and welfare of solitary elders by collaborating with its Networking of Love partners to connect social welfare groups and medical institutions providing care to solitary elders.

The related impact will be disclosed when the Company completes the evaluation.    4. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  For the convenience of readers, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been translated into English from the original Chinese version prepared and used in the R.O.C. If there is any conflict between the English version and the original Chinese version or any difference in the interpretation of the two versions, the Chinese-language consolidated financial statements shall prevail.  Statement of Compliance  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers and the IFRSs endorsed by the FSC with the effective dates (collectively, “Taiwan-IFRSs”).  Basis of Preparation   The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for financial instruments that are measured at fair values, as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.  Basis of Consolidation   The basis for the consolidated financial statements  The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of TSMC and entities controlled by TSMC (its subsidiaries).   Income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the shareholders of the parent and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.  When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Company.  - 17 -   - 18 -  All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.  Changes in the Company’s ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Company losing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Company’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity and attributed to shareholders of the parent.  When the Company loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss and is calculated as the difference between:  a. the aggregate of the fair value of consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest at the date when control is lost; and  b. the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interest.  The Company shall account for all amounts recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary on the same basis as would be required if the Company had directly disposed of the related assets and liabilities.  The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is regarded as the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate.

Note b: TSMC JDC has been established in January 2020.  Note c: TSMC Arizona has been established in November 2020.  Note d: Under the investment agreement entered into with the municipal government of Nanjing, China, the Company will make an investment in Nanjing in the amount of approximately US$3 billion to establish a subsidiary operating a 300mm wafer fab with the capacity of 20,000 12-inch wafers per month, and a design service center. The aforementioned 300mm wafer fab has reached the capacity of 20,000 12-inch wafers per month.  Note e: ISDF and ISDF II have completed the liquidation procedures in November 2020.  Foreign Currencies  The financial statements of each individual consolidated entity were expressed in the currency which reflected its primary economic environment (functional currency). The functional currency of TSMC and presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements are both New Taiwan Dollars (NT$). In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the operating results and financial positions of each consolidated entity are translated into NT$.  In preparing the financial statements of each individual consolidated entity, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Such exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss in the year in which they arise. Non-monetary items measured at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items are included in profit or loss for the year except for exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognized directly in other comprehensive income, in which case, the exchange differences are also recognized directly in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not retranslated.  For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign operations are translated into NT$ using exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity (attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate).  Classification of Current and Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities  Current assets are assets held for trading purposes and assets expected to be converted to cash, sold or consumed within one year from the end of the reporting period. Current liabilities are obligations incurred for trading purposes and obligations expected to be settled within one year from the end of the reporting period. Assets and liabilities that are not classified as current are noncurrent assets and liabilities, respectively.  - 19 -   - 20 -  Cash Equivalents  Cash equivalents, for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments, consist of highly liquid time deposits and investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.  Financial Instruments  Financial assets and liabilities shall be recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.  Financial assets and liabilities are initially recognized at fair values. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognized immediately in profit or loss.   Financial Assets  The classification of financial assets depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on a trade date or settlement date basis for which financial assets were classified in the same way, respectively. Regular way purchases or sales are purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.  a. Category of financial assets and measurement   Financial assets are classified into the following categories: financial assets at FVTPL, investments in debt instruments and equity instruments at FVTOCI, and financial assets at amortized cost.   1) Financial asset at FVTPL  For certain financial assets which include debt instruments that do not meet the criteria of amortized cost or FVTOCI, it is mandatorily required to measure them at FVTPL. Any gain or loss arising from remeasurement is recognized in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss incorporates any interest earned on the financial asset.   2) Investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI  Debt instruments with contractual terms specifying that cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, together with objective of collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, are measured at FVTOCI.  Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment gains or losses on investments in debt instruments at FVTOCI are recognized in profit or loss. Other changes in the carrying amount of these debt instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income and will be reclassified to profit or loss when these debt instruments are disposed.   3) Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI  On initial recognition, the Company may irrevocably designate investments in equity investments that is not held for trading as at FVTOCI.  - 20 -   - 21 -  Investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in other equity.  Dividends on these investments in equity instruments at FVTOCI are recognized in profit or loss when the Company’s right to receive the dividends is established, unless the Company’s rights clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment.   4) Measured at amortized cost  Cash and cash equivalents, debt instrument investments, notes and accounts receivable (including related parties), other receivables and refundable deposits are measured at amortized cost.  Debt instruments with contractual terms specifying that cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, together with objective of holding financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, are measured at amortized cost.  Subsequent to initial recognition, financial assets measured at amortized cost are measured at amortized cost, which equals to carrying amount determined by the effective interest method less any impairment loss.  b. Impairment of financial assets  At the end of each reporting period, a loss allowance for expected credit loss is recognized for financial assets at amortized cost (including accounts receivable) and for investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI.   The loss allowance for accounts receivable is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. For financial assets at amortized cost and investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI, when the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from possible default events of a financial instrument within 12 months after the reporting date. If, on the other hand, there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognized at an amount equal to expected credit loss resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument.  The Company recognizes an impairment loss in profit or loss for all financial instruments with a corresponding adjustment to their carrying amount through a loss allowance account, except for investments in debt instruments that are measured at FVTOCI, for which the loss allowance is recognized in other comprehensive income and does not reduce the carrying amount of the financial asset.  c. Derecognition of financial assets  The Company derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset to another entity.   On derecognition of a financial asset at amortized cost in its entirety, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable is recognized in profit or loss. On derecognition of an investment in a debt instrument at FVTOCI, the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized in profit or loss. However, on derecognition of an investment in an equity instrument at FVTOCI, the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is transferred directly to retained earnings, without recycling through profit or loss. - 21 -   - 22 -   Financial Liabilities and Equity Instruments  Classification as debt or equity  Debt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.  Equity instruments  An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognized at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.  Financial liabilities  Financial liabilities are subsequently measured either at amortized cost using effective interest method or at FVTPL.  Financial liabilities are classified as at fair value through profit or loss when the financial liability is either held for trading or is designated as at fair value through profit or loss.   Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognized in profit or loss.  Financial liabilities other than those held for trading purposes and designated as at FVTPL are subsequently measured at amortized cost at the end of each reporting period.  Derecognition of financial liabilities  The Company derecognizes financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognized and the consideration paid and payable is recognized in profit or loss.  Derivative Financial Instruments  Derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative financial instrument is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.  Hedge Accounting  a. Fair value hedge  The Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as interest rate futures contracts, to partially hedge against the fair value change caused by interest rates fluctuation in the Company’s fixed income investments. Changes in the fair value of hedging instrument that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognized in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged items that are attributable to the hedged risk.    - 22 -   - 23 -  b. Cash flow hedge  The Company designates certain hedging instruments, such as forward exchange contracts, to partially hedge its foreign exchange rate risks associated with certain highly probable forecast transactions (capital expenditures). The effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments is recognized in other comprehensive income. When the forecast transactions actually take place, the associated gains or losses that were recognized in other comprehensive income are removed from equity and included in the initial cost of the hedged items. The gains or losses from hedging instruments relating to the ineffective portion are recognized immediately in profit or loss.  The Company prospectively discontinues hedge accounting only when the hedging relationship ceases to meet the qualifying criteria; for instance, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.   Inventories  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories are recorded at standard cost and adjusted to approximate weighted-average cost at the end of the reporting period. Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price of inventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.  Investments Accounted for Using Equity Method  Investments accounted for using the equity method are investments in associates.  An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.  The operating results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognized in the consolidated statements of financial position at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognize the Company’s share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate as well as the distribution received. The Company also recognizes its share in the changes in the equities of associates.  Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Company’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of an associate recognized at the date of acquisition is recognized as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Company’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognized immediately in profit or loss.  When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.  When the Company subscribes to additional shares in an associate at a percentage different from its existing ownership percentage, the resulting carrying amount of the investment differs from the amount of the Company’s proportionate interest in the net assets of the associate. The Company records such a difference as an adjustment to investments with the corresponding amount charged or credited to capital surplus. If the Company’s ownership interest is reduced due to the additional subscription to the shares of associate by other investors, the proportionate amount of the gains or losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate shall be reclassified to profit or loss on the same basis as would be required if the associate had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.  - 23 -   - 24 -  When a consolidated entity transacts with an associate, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the associate are recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in the associate that are not owned by the Company.  Property, Plant and Equipment  Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment. Costs include any incremental costs that are directly attributable to the construction or acquisition of the item of property, plant and equipment.  Property, plant and equipment in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognized impairment loss. Such assets are classified to the appropriate categories of property, plant and equipment when completed and ready for intended use. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other identical categories of property, plant and equipment, commences when the assets are available for their intended use.  Depreciation is recognized so as to write off the cost of the assets less their residual values over their useful lives, and it is computed using the straight-line method mainly over the following estimated useful lives: land improvements - 20 years; buildings (assets used by the Company and assets subject to operating leases) - 10 to 20 years; machinery and equipment (assets used by the Company and assets subject to operating leases) - 5 years; and office equipment - 5 years. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimates accounted for on a prospective basis. Land is not depreciated.  An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the assets. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in profit or loss.  Leases  For a contract that contains a lease component and non-lease component, the Company may elect to account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.  The Company as lessor  Rental income from operating lease is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.  The Company as lessee  Except for payments for low-value asset leases and short-term leases (leases of machinery and equipment and others) which are recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis, the Company recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases at the commencement date of the lease.  Right-of-use assets are measured at cost. The cost of right-of-use assets comprises the initial measurement of lease liabilities adjusted for lease payments and initial direct costs made at or before the commencement date, plus an estimate of costs needed to restore the underlying assets. Subsequent measurement is calculated as cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss and adjusted for changes in lease liabilities as a result of lease term modifications or other related factors. Right-of-use assets are presented separately in the consolidated balance sheets.  Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement dates to the earlier of the end of the useful lives of the right-of-use assets or the end of the lease terms. If the lease transfers ownership of the underlying assets to the Company by the end of the lease terms or if the cost of right-of-use assets reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option, the Company depreciates the right-of-use assets from the commencement dates to the end of the useful lives of the underlying assets. - 24 -   - 23 -   Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments. Lease payments comprise fixed payments, variable lease payments which depend on an index or a rate and the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option. The lease payments are discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rates.  Subsequently, lease liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognized over the lease terms. When there is a change in a lease term, a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payments, or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase an underlying asset, the Company remeasures the lease liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use assets. Lease liabilities are presented on a separate line in the consolidated balance sheets.  Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.  Intangible Assets  Goodwill  Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any.  Other intangible assets  Other separately acquired intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is recognized using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: Technology license fees - the estimated life of the technology or the term of the technology transfer contract; software and system design costs - 3 years or contract period; patent and others - the economic life or contract period. The estimated useful life and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.  Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets  Goodwill  Goodwill is not amortized and instead is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the cash generating unit may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company’s cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the difference is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to such cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the cash generating unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the cash generating unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.  Tangible assets, right-of-use assets and other intangible assets  At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets (property, plant and equipment), right-of-use assets and other intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are - 25 -   - 24 -  allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.  Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.  If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.  When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.  Guarantee Deposit  Guarantee deposit mainly consists of cash received under deposit agreements with customers to ensure they have access to the Company’s specified capacity. Cash received from customers is recorded as guarantee deposit upon receipt. Guarantee deposits are refunded to customers when terms and conditions set forth in the deposit agreements have been satisfied.  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. The performance obligations are satisfied when customers obtain control of the promised goods, which is generally when the goods are delivered to the customers’ specified locations.  Revenue from sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. Estimated sales returns and other allowances is generally made and adjusted based on historical experience and the consideration of varying contractual terms to recognize refund liabilities, which is classified under accrued expenses and other current liabilities.  In principle, payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 30 days from the end of the month of when the invoice is issued. Due to the short term nature of the receivables from sale of goods with the immaterial discounted effect, the Company measures them at the original invoice amounts without discounting.  Employee Benefits  Short-term employee benefits  Liabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for service rendered by employees.  Retirement benefits  For defined contribution retirement benefit plans, payments to the benefit plan are recognized as an expense when the employees have rendered service entitling them to the contribution. For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing benefit is recognized based on actuarial calculations.   - 26 -   - 27 -  Defined benefit costs (including service cost, net interest and remeasurement) under the defined benefit retirement benefit plans are determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Service cost (including current service cost), and net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) are recognized as employee benefits expense in the period they occur. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss.   Net defined benefit liability represents the actual deficit in the Company’s defined benefit plan.  Taxation  Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.  Current tax  Income tax on unappropriated earnings (excluding earnings from foreign consolidated subsidiaries) is expensed in the year the shareholders approved the appropriation of earnings which is the year subsequent to the year the earnings are generated.  Adjustments of prior years’ tax liabilities are added to or deducted from the current year’s tax provision.  Deferred tax  Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits for research and development expenses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.   Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.  The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered. The deferred tax assets which originally not recognized is also reviewed at the end of each reporting period and recognized to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.  Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year in which the liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.  Current and deferred tax for the year  Current and deferred tax are recognized in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.  - 27 -   - 28 -  Government Grants  Government grants are not recognized until there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.  Government grants whose primary condition is that the Company should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire noncurrent assets (mainly including land use right and depreciable assets) are recognized as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related assets and recognized as a reduced depreciation or amortization charge in profit or loss over the contract period or useful lives of the related assets. Government grants that are receivables as compensation for expenses already incurred are deducted from incurred expenses in the period in which they become receivables.    5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION AND UNCERTAINTY  The Company has considered the economic implications of COVID-19 on critical accounting estimates and will continue evaluating the impact on its financial position and financial performance as a result of the pandemic.  In the application of the aforementioned Company’s accounting policies, the Company is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.  Critical Accounting Judgments  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue when the conditions described in Note 4 are satisfied.  Commencement of Depreciation Related to Property, Plant and Equipment Classified as Equipment under Installation and Construction in Progress (EUI/CIP)  As described in Note 4, commencement of depreciation related to EUI/CIP involves determining when the assets are available for their intended use. The criteria the Company uses to determine whether EUI/CIP are available for their intended use involves subjective judgments and assumptions about the conditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner.  Judgments on Lease Terms   In determining a lease term, the Company considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or not to exercise an option, including any expected changes in facts and circumstances from the commencement date until the exercise date of the option. Main factors considered include contractual terms and conditions covered by the optional periods, and the importance of the underlying asset to the lessee’s operations, etc. The lease term is reassessed if a significant change in circumstances that are within the control of the Company occurs.    - 28 -   - 29 -  Key Sources of Estimation and Uncertainty  Estimation of Sales Returns and Allowances  Sales returns and other allowance is estimated and recorded based on historical experience and in consideration of different contractual terms. The amount is deducted from revenue in the same period the related revenue is recorded. The Company periodically reviews the reasonableness of the estimates.  Valuation of Inventory  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the Company uses estimate to determine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of each reporting period.  The Company estimates the net realizable value of inventory for normal waste, obsolescence and unmarketable items at the end of reporting period and then writes down the cost of inventories to net realizable value.  The net realizable value of the inventory is determined mainly based on assumptions of future demand within a specific time horizon.  Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets Other than Goodwill  In the process of evaluating the potential impairment of tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill, the Company determines the independent cash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue and expenses related to the specific asset groups with the consideration of the nature of semiconductor industry. Any change in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in significant impairment charges or reversal in future years.  Realization of Deferred Income Tax Assets  Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those deferred tax assets can be utilized. Assessment of the realization of the deferred tax assets requires subjective judgment and estimate, including the future revenue growth and profitability, tax holidays, the amount of tax credits can be utilized and feasible tax planning strategies. Any changes in the global economic environment, the industry trends and relevant laws and regulations could result in significant adjustments to the deferred tax assets.  Determination of Lessees’ Incremental Borrowing Rates  In determining a lessee’s incremental borrowing rate used in discounting lease payments, the Company mainly takes into account the market risk-free rates, the estimated lessee’s credit spreads and secured status in a similar economic environment.    6.

The hedge ratio is adjusted in response to the changes in the financial market and capped at 100%.  On the basis of economic relationships, the Company expects that the value of the interest rate futures contracts and the value of the hedged financial assets will change in opposite directions in response to movements in interest rates.  The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is the credit risk of the hedged financial assets, which is not reflected in the fair value of the interest rate futures contracts. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships during the hedging period. Amount of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in profit or loss is classified under other gains and losses.  The following tables summarize the information relating to the hedges of interest rate risk.

The hedge ratio is adjusted in response to the changes in the financial market and capped at 100%. The forward exchange contracts have maturities of 12 months or less.  On the basis of economic relationships, the Company expects that the value of forward exchange contracts and the value of hedged transactions will change in opposite directions in response to movements in foreign exchange rates.  The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is driven by the effect of the counterparty’s own credit risk on the fair value of forward exchange contracts. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, refer to Note 22(d) for gain or loss arising from changes in the fair value of hedging instruments and the amount transferred to initial carrying amount of hedged items.

These accounts receivable are classified as at FVTOCI because they are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.  In principle, the payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 30 days from the end of the month when the invoice is issued. Aside from recognizing impairment loss for credit-impaired accounts receivable, the Company recognizes loss allowance based on the expected credit loss ratio of customers by different risk levels with consideration of factors of historical loss ratios and customers’ financial conditions, competitiveness and business outlook. For accounts receivable past due over 90 days without collaterals or guarantees, the Company recognizes loss allowance at full amount.

The value in use was calculated based on the cash flow forecast from the financial budgets covering the future five-year period, and the Company used annual discount rates of 8.0% in both years in its test of impairment as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, to reflect the relevant specific risk in the cash-generating unit.  For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not recognize any impairment loss on goodwill.   17.
