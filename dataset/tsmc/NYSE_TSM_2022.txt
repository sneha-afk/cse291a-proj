132133Risk Appetite and Risk Management ScopeTSMC has defined its risk appetite statements, which outline the nature and extent of the risks which TSMC is willing to take in pursuit of its business goals. These risk appetite statements are:●Risk taken should be carefully evaluated, commensurate with rewards and be in line with the Company’s strategic, investment, financial and corporate objectives.●Risk considerations are embedded into business operations and managed within the risk tolerance (risk indicators) of the divisions, functions and Company.●TSMC will not invest or participate in any business activities that exceeds our risk tolerance. The Company does not condone safety related breaches or lapses, non-compliance with laws and regulations, as well as acts such as fraud, bribery and corruption.Adopting the five-step risk management process consisting of the identification, assessment, response, monitor and review of risks, risks assessments are performed by key functional units, to form the enterprise-level risk map and mitigation plans, that are presented to the Audit Committee. This process is supported by ongoing education and awareness efforts in fostering a risk-aware culture and building risk competencies.●Risk Management ScopeStrategic RisksOperational Risks●Industry developments●Changes in technology (including IT security)●Decrease in demand and average selling price●Competition●Changes in the government policies and regulatory environment●Natural and man-made disasters●Capacity expansion●Construction of new fabs●Sales concentration●Purchasing concentration●Intellectual property rights●Litigious and non-litigious matters●Mergers and acquisitions●Recruiting quality personnel●Future R&D plans and expected R&D spending●Change in corporate reputation and impact on the Company’s crisis management●Change in management●Non-compliance with export control, environmental and climate change related laws, regulations and accords, and failure to timely obtain requisite approvals necessary for conducting businessFinancial Risks●Economic risks (including interest rate fluctuation, foreign exchange volatility, inflation, and amendments to tax regulations or implementation of new tax laws)●External financing●High-risk/highly leveraged investments; lending, endorsements, and guarantees for other parties; and financial derivative transactions●Impairment charges Other Risks●Sales of significant numbers of shares by TSMC’s directors, and/or shareholders who own 10% or more of TSMC’s total outstanding shares●Trade policiesTSMC recognizes that its systems and processes provide reasonable but not absolute assurance and hence continually improve to ensure that its ability to manage and respond to risks and opportunities remain relevant and effective.Risk Management OrganizationRisk management in TSMC involves the reporting and oversight structure involving both Board of Directors and management of TSMC that seeks to embed sound risk management practices in business decisions and operations across TSMC. The Board of Directors is responsible for the governance of risk and has authorized the Audit Committee to review TSMC’s ERM framework. At the management level, the risk management organization is composed of the Risk Management Steering Committee, the Risk Management Executive Council, the Risk Management Taskforces and the Risk Management Division.The Risk Management Division works with each function in applying the ERM framework to assess and mitigate risks throughout TSMC by risk monitoring, conducting workshops, and implementing risk related policies and guidelines. Annually, the risk management organization reports to the Audit Committee on TSMC’s key risks and mitigation efforts, and the Audit Committee’s Chairperson reports to the Board of Directors on the risk profile and risk mitigation measures being taken.Risk management is a shared responsibility of both management and employees. All employees are required to be competent and accountable for managing risks related to their area of responsibility with an emphasis on clear risk ownership. The roles and responsibilities of the risk management organization are defined as below:●Risk Management Steering Committee1. Advises the Board in determining overall risk appetite, tolerance, strategy and resources allocation (taking into account of the current and prospective macroeconomic, technological, regulatory, environmental and social developments and trends).2.

The Company is cognizant of the major risks of natural and man-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, sandstorms, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, fire, gas/chemical leakage, pandemic, cyber-attacks, sabotage, failure of critical facilities and equipment, shortages in the supply of utilities, such as water, electricity and natural gas, etc. could disrupt TSMC’s operations.To mitigate the operational impacts of crisis events, the Risk Management Division implements pre-crisis risk assessment, response procedures and recovery plans. Exercises and drills are also conducted to validate our emergency responses, crisis management, business continuity plans to enhance operational preparedness. In major incidents or crisis events, the Crisis Management Guideline guides in the management and responses. The Central Crisis Command Centre (C4), headed by CEO and comprised of senior executives across key functions, provides guidance and decision-making to ensure a constant readiness-to-respond capability, including rapid responses and communication to key stakeholders.6.3.2 Strategic RisksRisks Associated with Changes in Technology and Industry●Industry Developments The electronics industries and semiconductor market are cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid fluctuations in product demand, which could impact TSMC’s semiconductor foundry business. Variations in order levels from TSMC’s customers may result in volatility in the Company’s revenue and earnings.From time to time, the electronics and semiconductor industries have experienced significant and occasionally prolonged periods of downturns and overcapacity. Because TSMC is, and will continue to be, dependent on the demand of electronics and semiconductor companies for its services, periods of downturns and overcapacity in the general electronics and semiconductor industries could lead to reduced demand for overall semiconductor foundry services, including TSMC’s services. If TSMC cannot take appropriate actions, such as reducing its costs to sufficiently offset declines in demand, the Company’s revenue, margins and earnings will likely suffer during periods of downturns and overcapacity. ●Changes in TechnologyThe semiconductor industry and its technologies are constantly changing. TSMC competes by developing process technologies using increasingly advanced nodes and manufacturing products with more functions. The Company also competes by developing new derivative technologies. If TSMC does not anticipate these changes in technologies and rapidly develop new and innovative technologies, or the Company’s competitors unforeseeably gain sudden access to additional technologies, TSMC may not be able to provide foundry services on competitive terms. In addition, TSMC’s customers have significantly decreased the time in which their products or services are launched into the market. If TSMC is unable to meet these shorter product time-to-market, it risks losing these customers. These factors have also been intensified by the shift of the global technology market to consumer driven products, such as smartphones, and increasing competition and concentration of customers (all further discussed among these risk factors).Also, the uncertainty and instability inherent in advanced technologies impose challenges for achieving expected product quality and product yield. If TSMC fails to maintain quality, it may result in loss of revenue and additional cost, as well as loss of business or customer trust. If TSMC is unable to overcome the above factors, it may become less competitive and its revenue may decline significantly.Regarding the response measures for the above-mentioned risks, please refer to “2.2.4 TSMC Position, Differentiation and Strategy” on page 18-20 of this Annual Report.●IT SecurityEven though TSMC has established a comprehensive internet and computing security network, the Company cannot guarantee that its computing systems which control or maintain vital corporate functions, such as its manufacturing operations and enterprise accounting, would be completely immune to crippling cyberattacks. In the event of a serious cyberattack, TSMC’s systems may lose important corporate data or its production lines may be shut down pending the resolution of such attack. Major cyberattacks could also lead to loss or divulgence of trade secrets and other sensitive information, such as proprietary information of its customers and other stakeholders and personal information of its employees. While TSMC seeks to continuously review and assess its cybersecurity policies and procedures to ensure their adequacy and effectiveness, the Company cannot guarantee that it will not be susceptible to new and emerging risks and attacks in the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats.Malicious hackers may also try to introduce computer viruses, corrupted software or ransomware into TSMC’s network systems to disrupt its operations, blackmail the Company to regain control of its computing systems, or spy on it for sensitive information. These attacks may result in TSMC having to pay damages for its delayed or disrupted orders or incur significant expenses in implementing remedial and improvement measures to further enhance its cybersecurity network, and may also expose the Company to significant legal liabilities arising from or related to legal proceedings or regulatory investigations associated with such breaches.In the past, TSMC has experienced and may in the future be subject to attack by malicious software. TSMC has implemented and continually updated rigorous cybersecurity measures to prevent and minimize harm caused by such attacks. Such measures include advanced virus scanning tools to protect fab equipment, strengthening firewall and network controls to prevent computer viruses from spreading among tools and fabs, installing advanced malware defense solutions for critical computers, introducing new solution architecture to secure internet access, adopting advanced solutions against distributed denial-of-service attacks from the internet, introducing new technology for data protection, enhancing and certifying office computer security compliance, improving email phishing defense and implementing employee awareness testing. TSMC also established an integrated and automatic security operation platform, enabled the automation of cybersecurity event detection and response, enhanced internal security assessment automation, conducted external red team testing and practiced responses to ransomware attacks. For supply chain risks reduction, through collaboration, TSMC helped major suppliers improve their security maturity and share industry security events and best practices on demand and by schedule. Moreover, TSMC has collaborated with Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Institute (“SEMI”) to set up a Semiconductor Cybersecurity Committee to promote security standards (SEMI E187) as well as security assessment methodology for improving the resilience of semiconductor supply chain. While these ongoing enhancements further improve Company’s cybersecurity defense solutions, there can be no assurance that the Company is immune to cyberattacks.In addition, TSMC employs certain third-party service providers for it and its affiliates worldwide with whom it needs to share highly sensitive and confidential information to enable them to provide the relevant services. While TSMC requires such third-party service providers to strictly fulfill the confidentiality and/or internet security requirements in its service agreements with them, there is no assurance that each of them will comply with such obligations. Moreover, such third-party service providers may also be susceptible to cyberattacks. If TSMC or its service providers are not able to timely resolve the respective technical difficulties caused by such cyberattacks, or ensure the integrity and availability of its data (and data belonging to its customers and other third parties) or maintain control of its or its service providers’ computing systems, the Company’s commitments to its customers and other stakeholders may be materially impaired and its results of operations, financial condition, prospects and reputation may also be materially and adversely affected.Risks Associated with Decrease in Demand and Average Selling PriceA vast majority of the Company’s revenue is derived from customers who use TSMC’s products in smartphones, high performance computing, IoT, automotive, and digital consumer electronics. Any deterioration in or a slowdown in the growth of such end markets resulting in a substantial decrease in the demand for overall global semiconductor foundry services, including TSMC’s products and services, could adversely affect the Company’s revenue. Further, semiconductor manufacturing 136137facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed cost assets once they are in operation. Because the Company owns most of its manufacturing capacities, a significant portion of its operating costs is fixed. In general, these costs do not decline when customer demand or TSMC’s capacity utilization rates drop, and thus declines in customer demand, among other factors, may significantly decrease TSMC’s margins. Conversely, as product demand rises and factory utilization increases, the fixed costs are spread over increased output, which can improve TSMC’s margins. In addition, the historical trend of declining average selling prices (“ASP”) of end use applications places downward pressure on the prices of the components that go into such applications. Decreases in the ASP of end use applications may increase pricing pressure on components produced by TSMC, which, in turn, may negatively impact the Company’s revenue, margin and earnings.Risks Associated with CompetitionThe markets for TSMC’s foundry services are highly competitive. The Company competes with other foundry service providers, as well as a number of integrated device manufacturers. Some of these companies may have access to more advanced technologies than TSMC. Other companies may have greater financial and other resources than TSMC, such as the possibility of receiving direct or indirect government subsidies, economic stimulus funds, or other incentives that may be unavailable to TSMC. The governments of the United States, China, Europe, South Korea, and Japan provide various incentive programs to promote developments of their domestic semiconductor industries, such as the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act of 2022 (the “U.S. CHIPS Act”), which provides financial incentives to incentivize the development of U.S. semiconductor industry. Although governments in certain of the countries or regions where TSMC is currently expanding or planning to expand its production capacity have extended or may in the future extend certain financial incentives to the Company, there is no assurance that TSMC will be able to apply for or receive such financial incentives at the levels TSMC expects or at all. Additionally, any financial incentives the Company receive may be subject to strict conditions, or the grantors could seek to recover any funds provided to TSMC, or cancel, reduce or deny our requested subsidies or grants in the future. This could materially increase TSMC’s operating costs and adversely affect its results of operations.Furthermore, the Company’s competitors may, from time to time, also decide to undertake aggressive pricing initiatives in one or several technology nodes. These competitive activities may decrease TSMC’s customer base or its ASP, or both. If TSMC is unable to compete effectively with such new and aggressive competitors on technology, manufacturing capacity, product quality and customer satisfaction, it risks losing customers to such new contenders.Risks Associated with Changes in the Government Policies and Regulatory EnvironmentTSMC management closely monitors all domestic and foreign governmental policies and regulations that might impact TSMC’s business and financial operations. During 2022 and as of the date of this Annual Report, the following changes or developments in governmental policies and regulations may influence the Company’s business operations:The manufacturing, assembling and testing of TSMC’s products require the use of chemicals and materials that are subject to environmental, climate related, health and safety laws and regulations issued worldwide as well as international accords such as the Paris Agreement. Climate change related laws or regulations currently are too indefinite for the Company to assess the impact on our future financial condition with any degree of reasonable certainty. For example, the Taiwan “Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act”, which became effective on July 1, 2015, was amended and was renamed as “Climate Change Response Act”. The amendment became effective in February 2023, which set a goal of reaching net-zero emissions in Taiwan by 2050 and also established a carbon fee system that will collect carbon fees on direct and indirect emissions from emitters whose emissions reach certain thresholds. The carbon fee system is expected to take effect by 2024 and the rate for such fees has yet to be determined by the relevant authorities. We may be required to pay any incurred carbon fees if our emission levels exceed applicable thresholds pursuant to the carbon fee system, which could result in increased operating costs for us and affect us financially to a certain extent. We expect to see more of its relevant regulations promulgated by the regulators in the future. Also, the R.O.C. legislative authority is reviewing, at all times, various environmental issues to develop laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and climate related changes. The impact of such laws and regulations, as well as of the carbon fee, is indeterminable at the moment.It is not expected that other governmental policies or regulatory changes would materially impact TSMC’s operations or financial condition.6.3.3 Operational RisksNatural and Man-Made DisasterTSMC is committed to maintaining operational resilience in accordance with business continuity management standards that equips it with the capability to respond effectively to business disruption. Disruptions caused by natural and man-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, sandstorms, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, fire, gas/chemical leakage, pandemic, cyber-attacks, sabotage, failure of critical facilities and equipment, shortages in the supply of utilities, such as water, electricity and natural gas, etc. could interrupt TSMC’s operations.Most of TSMC’s production facilities, as well as those of many of its suppliers, customers and upstream providers of complementary semiconductor manufacturing services, are located in areas susceptible to natural disasters and may face potential shortages of electricity or water, which could cause interruptions to TSMC’s operations.Thus, if one or more natural disasters result in a prolonged disruption to TSMC’s operations or those of its customers or suppliers, or if any of its fabs or vendor facilities were to be damaged or cease operations as a result of an unforeseen disruptive event, it could reduce TSMC’s manufacturing capacity and cause the loss of important customers and thereby have an adverse, material impact on its operational and financial performance.To cope with possible droughts resulted from severe climate change, TSMC implemented manufacturing process water saving, as well as building up industrial water recycling plants, using household water cooperating with government to mitigate water shortage risk. TSMC also implemented its business continuity plans, including water conservation measures, the use of more alternative water sources, water supplied by tank cars, stress tests and various exercises. As a result, there was no material impact to TSMC’s business or operational performance.TSMC has occasionally suffered power outages, dips or surges caused by difficulties encountered by its electricity supplier or other power consumers on the same power grid. Some of these have resulted in interruptions to TSMC’s operations. Such shortages or interruptions in electricity supply could further be exacerbated by changes in the energy policy of the governments. If TSMC is unable to secure reliable and uninterrupted supply of electricity to power its manufacturing fabs, its ability to fill customers’ orders would be jeopardized.If such events were to occur over prolonged periods of time, TSMC’s operations and financial performance may be materially adversely affected. Moreover, TSMC’s future capacity expansions in Taiwan and elsewhere could be curtailed by utility shortages.The COVID-19 pandemic has had impacts on worldwide economic activity. Prolonged impacts of COVID-19 or future similar events could adversely affect TSMC’s business and results of operations in several ways, including but not limited to: (1) interruption of the operations of TSMC’s supply chains for equipment, parts and materials in terms of manufacturing, logistics, and manpower arrangements for tool installation; (2) fluctuation in TSMC customers’ demands for certain products, leading to uncertainties for TSMC’s capacity planning and also for meeting customer demand, which may harm TSMC’s business with its customers and subject TSMC to the risk of legal disputes; and (3) potential production delays for TSMC’s products due to forced fab or office closures or partial operation.TSMC has formed an “Epidemic Prevention Committee” to identify, implement and monitor actions stemming from the dynamic exigencies of the pandemic, including but not limited to, health management of its employees, splitting operation and work from home arrangements, identification and control of high risk individuals, rapid investigation of confirmed cases, management of production inventory, supply chain management, and capacity management for demand changes. As of the date of this annual report, TSMC’s current business and results of operations have not been materially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and with the easing of the COVID-19 pandemic, TSMC does not expect its business and results of operations will be directly affected. Nevertheless, the Company could still face the post-pandemic downward changes in consumers’ demand for electronic products, which in turn lead to reduced demand for and place downward pressure on the price of TSMC’s products and services.TSMC has further strengthened its business continuity management, which includes periodic risk assessments and mitigations, and the establishment of taskforces before emergency events. The taskforces define emergency response, crisis communication, recovery plans and preventative measures based on the thorough analysis of derivative effects and alternative solutions to ensure the impacts of people injury, business interruption, finance are minimized. TSMC reviews periodically its business continuity plans and refines them to reflect exercise results and implementation. In response to 138139the impact of the earthquakes that occurs in Taiwan, TSMC continues to improve its earthquake emergency response, tool anchorage and seismic isolation facilities, and readiness for tool salvage and production recovery. These improvements have been integrated into new fab design. TSMC’s business continuity procedures were further enhanced through the compliance with ISO 22301 business continuity management system (BCMS).TSMC maintains a comprehensive risk management system dedicated to human safety, the conservation of natural resources and the protection of property. In order to cope effectively with emergencies and natural disasters, management at each facility has developed comprehensive plans and procedures that focus on risk prevention, emergency response, crisis management and business continuity. All TSMC manufacturing fabs have been ISO 14001 certified (environmental management) and ISO 45001 certified (occupational health and safety management). All manufacturing fabs in Taiwan have also been TOSHMS (Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System) certified. New fabs will also attain the above certifications within 18 months after acquiring factory registration certification.TSMC and many of its suppliers use flammable and toxic materials in their manufacturing processes and are therefore subject to risks that cannot be completely eliminated arising from explosion, fire, or environmental influences. Although TSMC maintains multiple layers of risk prevention and protection, as well as fire and casualty insurance, TSMC’s risk management and insurance coverage may not always be sufficient to cover all of its potential losses. If any of TSMC’s fabs or vendor facilities were to be damaged or cease operations as a result of an explosion, fire or environmental causes, it could reduce the TSMC’s manufacturing capacity leading to the loss of important sales and customers and have a negative impact on TSMC’s financial performance. In addition to periodic fire-protection inspections and firefighting drills, TSMC has also carried out a corporate-wide fire risk mitigation project focused on managerial and hardware improvements.TSMC continues to monitor key disruptive threats to its business operations and adapt the plans to ensure operational resilience.Risks Associated with Capacity ExpansionTSMC performs long-term market demand forecasts for its products and services to manage its overall capacity. Based on its market demand forecasts, the Company has continued to add capacity to meet market needs for its products and services, including in Taiwan, in Arizona, U.S., in Nanjing, China and in Kumamoto, Japan.Implementing these capacity expansion plans will increase its costs, and the increases may be substantial. For example, the Company would need to build new facilities, purchase additional equipment and hire and train personnel to operate the new equipment. If TSMC does not increase its net revenue accordingly, its financial performance may be adversely affected by these increased costs.In addition, market conditions are dynamic and TSMC’s market demand forecasts may change significantly at any time. During periods of decreased demand, certain manufacturing lines or tools in some of the Company’s manufacturing facilities may be suspended or shut down temporarily. However, if demand subsequently increases rapidly over a short period of time, TSMC may not be able to restore the capacity in a timely manner to take advantage of the upturn. In such circumstances, its financial performance and competitiveness may be adversely affected.In order to mitigate the risk associated with capacity expansion, TSMC continuously watches for changes in market conditions and works closely with its customers. When market demand is not as expected, the Company tries to adjust its capacity plans in a timely manner to reduce the impact on its financial performance.Risks Associated with Construction of New FabsThe Company has multiple expansion projects that are currently underway, including the design and construction of new fabs worldwide. Global expansion has required and will continue to require considerable managerial, financial and other resources. The Company expects to face particular challenges in global expansion and operations, including but not limited to:●higher costs associated with construction of new fabs, establishing supply chains for various materials in different overseas locations, the impact on the Company’s ability to sustain its current level of productivity and manufacturing efficiency provided by its ecosystem of interconnected semiconductor fabs, employees and suppliers in the R.O.C., and recruiting and retaining talent in various overseas locations;●labor shortages, interruptions in the supply chains for various materials, and construction issues, which could substantially delay the completion of the Company’s expansion projects, and could further result in substantial additional costs or failure to meet its capacity expansion plans;●disruptions to the Company’s operations caused by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, sandstorms, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, fire, gas/chemical leakage, pandemic, sabotage, failure of critical facilities and equipment and shortages in the supply of utilities, such as water and electricity;●scarcity of industrial-use land, which could limit the Company’s future expansion of operations;●compliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations, and the risk of penalties if the Company’s practices are deemed not to be in compliance;●challenges in managing information technology infrastructure in multiple locations and across different systems and risks of our information technology infrastructure succumbing to cyberattacks by third parties worldwide;●adverse changes relating to government grants or other government incentives;●challenges relating to work culture differences and inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances;●limited or insufficient intellectual property protection or difficulties enforcing the Company’s rights to intellectual property; and●exposure to different tax jurisdictions and potential adverse tax consequences.If TSMC is unable to overcome the above challenges, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Risks Associated with Sales ConcentrationOver the years, the Company’s customer profile and the nature of the Company’s customers’ business have changed dramatically. While TSMC generates revenue from hundreds of customers worldwide, TSMC’s ten largest customers in 2020, 2021 and 2022 accounted for approximately, 74%, 71% and 68% of TSMC’s net revenue in the respective year. TSMC’s largest customer in 2020, 2021 and 2022 accounted for 25%, 26% and 23% of the Company’s net revenue in the respective year. TSMC’s second largest customer in 2020 and 2021 accounted for 12% and 10% of TSMC’s net revenue in the respective year. In 2022, TSMC’s second largest customer accounted for less than 10% of TSMC’s net revenue.A more concentrated customer base will subject TSMC’s revenue to seasonal demand fluctuations from the Company’s large customers, and cause different seasonal patterns in the Company’s business. This customer concentration results in part from the changing dynamics of the electronics industry with the structural shift to mobile and high performance computing (HPC) devices and applications and software that provide the content for such devices.There are only a limited number of customers who are successfully exploiting this new business model paradigm. Also, TSMC has seen the changes of nature in its customers’ business models in response to this new business model paradigm. For example, there is a growing trend toward the system companies developing their own designed semiconductors and working directly with semiconductor foundries which makes their products and services more marketable in a changing consumer market.Also, since the global semiconductor industry is becoming increasingly competitive, some of TSMC’s customers have engaged in industry consolidations in order to remain competitive. Such consolidations have taken the form of mergers and acquisitions. If more of TSMC’s major customers consolidate, this will further decrease the overall number of the Company’s customer pool. In addition, regulatory restrictions, such as export controls directed at TSMC’s major customers, could impact the Company’s ability to supply products to those customers, reduce those customers’ demand for TSMC’s products and services and impact their business operations.The loss of, or significant curtailment of purchases by, one or more of the Company’s top customers, including curtailments due to increased competitive pressures, industry consolidation, changes in applicable regulatory restrictions, product designs, manufacturing sourcing or outsourcing policies or practices of these customers, the timing of customer inventory adjustments, or changes in its major customers’ business models, may adversely affect TSMC’s results of operations and financial condition.Risks Associated with Purchasing Concentration●Raw MaterialsTSMC’s production operations require that it obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, such as silicon wafers, gases, chemicals, and photoresist, on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices. In the past, shortages in the supply of some materials, whether by specific suppliers or by the semiconductor industry generally, have resulted in occasional industry-wide price adjustments and delivery delays. Moreover, major natural disasters, trade barriers and political or economic turmoil, including military conflicts and inflation occurring within the country of origin of such raw materials may also significantly disrupt the availability of such raw 140141materials or increase their prices. Also, since TSMC procures some of its raw materials from sole-sourced suppliers, there is a risk that the Company’s needs for such raw materials may not be met or that back-up supplies may not be readily available. Importation and domestic production limitations may also limit our ability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials as well as materials of the necessary quality. In addition, recent trade tensions could result in increased prices or even unavailability of raw materials due to tariffs, export control or other non-tariff barriers. TSMC’s revenue and earnings could decline if it is unable to obtain adequate supplies of the necessary raw materials in a timely manner or if there are significant increases in the costs of raw materials. To reduce the supply chain risk and to manage the cost effectively, TSMC commits resources toward developing new supply sources. Further, the Company continually encourages its suppliers to reduce their supply chain risk by decentralizing production plants and to improve their cost competitiveness by moving their production facilities to Taiwan from higher-cost areas.Given that qualified backup suppliers are hard to find, TSMC engages early and extensively with primary suppliers on managing quality and capacity issues so as to be prepared for any unexpected need to ramp up or curtail production when the Company lacks sufficient time to re-tune its production process. For leading technology nodes, TSMC not only adopts world-class processes and facilities but also requires world-class materials. To streamline supply chain risk, the Company has increased supplier site audits and meetings to extend supply chain best practices to its upstream suppliers. In addition, in response to the rapid increase or decrease in production capacity of new products, TSMC has continued to improve its inventory monitoring system to achieve more accurate demand forecasts and ensure that the supply chain maintains sufficient inventory levels. The Company has established a supply chain risk assessment to ensure that critical suppliers meet various standards in labor, ethics, ESH (environmental, safety and health) and BCP (business continuity plan). Onsite audits are conducted regularly to encourage suppliers to take responsibility for their supply chain, as any regulatory violations or adverse environmental impact event, or failure to meet sustainability requirements could result in business reduction or termination.●EquipmentThe Company’s operations and ongoing expansion plans depend on its ability to obtain an appropriate amount of equipment and related services available from a limited number of suppliers. TSMC may encounter the situation of limited supply and long delivery cycles. To better manage its supply chain, the Company evaluates and projects delivery lead times to minimize the impact of supply chain risks on operating costs. TSMC has also implemented various collaborative business models and risk management contingencies with suppliers to ensure supply and shorten the procurement lead time. However, if TSMC is unable to acquire in a timely manner the equipment and parts it needs, it may fail to successfully implement capacity expansion plans and exploit time sensitive business opportunities. Additionally, ongoing trade tensions could result in increased prices for, or even unavailability of, key equipment, through delay or denial of necessary export licenses, adoption of additional export control measures and other tariff or non-tariff barriers. If TSMC is unable to obtain equipment in a timely fashion to fulfill its customers’ demand for technology and production capacity, or unable to do so at a reasonable cost, its financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.Risks Associated with Intellectual Property RightsThe Company’s ability to compete successfully and to achieve future growth depends in part on the continued strength of its intellectual property portfolio. While the Company actively enforces and protects our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that its efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of its proprietary technologies, software, trade secrets or know-how. Also, the Company cannot assure you that, as its business or business models expand into new areas, it will be able to develop independently the technologies, patents, software, trade secrets or know-how necessary to conduct its business or that it can do so without unknowingly infringing the intellectual property rights of others. As a result, the Company may have to rely on, to a certain degree, licensed technologies and patent licenses from others. To the extent that the Company relies on licenses from others, there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain any or all of the necessary licenses in the future on terms it considers reasonable or at all. The lack of necessary licenses could expose the Company to claims for damages and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by its customers in instances where it has contractually agreed to indemnify its customers against damages resulting from infringement claims.The Company has received, from time to time, communications from third parties, including non-practicing entities and semiconductor companies, asserting that TSMC’s technologies, its manufacturing processes, or the design IPs of the semiconductors made by TSMC or the use of those semiconductors by its customers may infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. Because of the nature of the industry, its market position, and the expansion of its manufacturing operations outside of Taiwan, the Company may receive an increased number of such communications in the future. The assertions made and lawsuits initiated by litigious, well-funded, non-practicing entities are particularly aggressive in their monetary demand and in seeking court-issued injunctions. Such lawsuits and assertions may increase TSMC’s cost of doing business and may potentially be extremely disruptive if these asserting entities succeed in blocking the trade of products made and services offered by TSMC. Also, with the expansion of its manufacturing operations into certain non-R.O.C jurisdictions, it has faced increased challenges in managing risks of intellectual property misappropriation. Despite our efforts to adopt robust measures to mitigate the risk of intellectual property misappropriation in such new jurisdictions, we cannot guarantee that the protection measures we adopted will be sufficient to prevent us from potential infringements by others, or at all.If the Company fails to obtain or maintain certain technologies or intellectual property licenses or fails to prevent our intellectual property from being misappropriated and, if litigation relating to alleged intellectual property matters occurs, it could: (1) prevent the Company from manufacturing particular products or selling particular services or applying particular technologies; and (2) reduce our ability to compete effectively against entities benefiting from our misappropriated intellectual property, which could reduce its opportunities to generate revenue.The Company has taken related measures to minimize potential loss of shareholder value arising from intellectual property claims and litigation filed against it. These measures include: strategically obtaining licenses from certain semiconductor and other technology companies as needed; timely securing intellectual property rights originating within and outside of TSMC for defensive and/or offensive protection of TSMC technology and business; and aggressively defending against baseless litigation.Risks Associated with Litigious and Non-litigious MattersAs is the case with many companies in the semiconductor industry, the Company has received from time to time communications from third parties asserting that its technologies, its manufacturing processes, or the design of the semiconductors made by TSMC or the use of those semiconductors by its customers may infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights. These assertions have at times resulted in litigation by or against the Company and settlement payments by the Company. Irrespective of the validity of these claims, the Company could incur significant costs in the defense thereof or could suffer adverse effects on its operations. The Company is also subject to antitrust compliance requirements and scrutiny by governmental regulators in multiple jurisdictions. Any adverse results of such proceeding or other similar proceedings that may arise in those jurisdictions could harm TSMC’s business and distract its management, and thereby have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or prospects, and subject the Company to potential significant legal liability.Currently, TSMC’s material legal proceeding is as follows:In September 2022, Daedalus Prime LLC (“Daedalus”) filed complaints in the U.S. International Trade Commission (“ITC”) and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that TSMC, TSMC North America, and other companies infringe four U.S. patents. The ITC instituted an investigation in October 2022. The outcome cannot be determined and we cannot make a reliable estimate of the contingent liability at this time.Other than the matter described above, as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC is not currently a party to any other material legal proceedings.Risks Associated with Mergers and AcquisitionsIn 2022 and as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC had not conducted any merger or acquisition.Risks Associated with Recruiting Quality PersonnelTSMC relies on the continued service and contribution of its management team, skilled technical and professional personnel. The Company’s business could suffer from the inability to fulfill personnel needs with high quality professionals in a timely fashion caused by the loss of personnel, talent shortages, illegal talent poaching, immigration controls, or related changes in market demand for its products and services. Since there is fierce competition for talent recruitment, the Company cannot ensure timely fulfillment of its personnel demand.In order to reduce the risk of talent recruitment challenges, TSMC encourages job rotation and employs an on-the-job training and certification system. In this way, employees can learn and enhance their work efficiency and effectiveness in the actual workplace. Moreover, TSMC creates multiple recruitment 142143channels and continues to hire various top-notch, talented professionals from Taiwan and overseas. At the same time, the Company continues to expand industry-academic cooperation to meet outstanding talented individuals at an early phase in order to recruit them in the future.Future R&D Plans and Expected R&D SpendingFor additional details, see “5.2.7 Future R&D Plans” on page 102 of this Annual Report.Changes in Corporate Reputation and Impact on the Company’s Crisis ManagementTSMC has established an excellent reputation based on its core values of integrity, commitment, innovation and customer trust. The Company’s positive image also reflects outstanding operations, rigorous corporate governance and dedication to sustainable responsibility by serving as a good corporate citizen. TSMC continues to pursue innovation in economic, environmental and social dimensions.In 2022, TSMC was honored with numerous awards for achievements in various areas including operations, corporate governance, patents, profit growth, investor relations, environmental protection, corporate sustainability, and other fields. The Company was selected as a part of the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the 22nd consecutive year and received the following awards: the inaugural Honorable Legion of Corporate Sustainability Top 100 launched by CommonWealth Magazine the Excellence in Corporate Social Responsibility Award; the Taiwan Institute for Sustainable Energy 2022 Taiwan Corporate Sustainability Awards’ First Place in Taiwan Top Ten Sustainability Exemplary Awards – the Corporate Sustainability Report Award – the Climate Leadership Award, the Circular Economy Leadership Award, the Supply Chain Management Award, the Sustainable Water Management Award, the Growth Through Innovation Leadership Award, and the Information Security Leadership Award. TSMC ranked in the top 5% in the Taiwan Stock Exchange corporate governance evaluation. The Company was named a member of: Fortune Magazine’s 2022 World’s Most Admired Companies and the Fortune Global 500; the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations for 2022; and of the 2022 Carbon Clean 200TM list by Corporate Knights and As You Sow. In addition, TSMC was selected as part of the Morgan Stanley Capital International All Country World Index (MSCI ACWI) ESG Leaders Index.To promote sustainability, TSMC’s ESG Steering Committee, led by Chairman Dr. Mark Liu, presented the third TSMC ESG Award in 2022, honoring internal organizations and divisions for tangible achievements in the Company’s five ESG strategic directions: Drive Green Manufacturing, Build a Responsible Supply Chain, Create a Diverse and Inclusive Workplace, Develop Talent, and Care For The Disadvantaged. At the same time, this award presentation encouraged all employees to propose new ideas for sustainability to be assessed for feasibility and potential incorporation in the Company’s implementation plans. Compared with 1,257 sustainability proposals in the second year, the third annual ESG Award received 1,880 innovative ideas, adding new energy to the Company’s culture of sustainability.Mindful of its global reputation, TSMC employs numerous preventative measures to address potential risks from earthquakes, fires, IT service disruption, yield loss, information security, supply chain disruption, pandemics, environmental events, and utility supply disruption. TSMC practices  crisis management and implements recovery measures to deal with possible crisis events and maintains a crisis command center for control guideline and prepares emergency response procedures” to ensure timely and prompt responses during a crisis. TSMC also performs regular exercises for crisis scenarios to ensure that crisis management procedures are comprehensive. and validated. In 2022, TSMC received a rating of “Low ESG Risk” from the Sustainalytics ESG Risk Ratings.TSMC’s environment, safety and health committee holds monthly meetings to coordinate with relevant departments in each fab to conduct emergency response drills and continuously improve their notification and operational procedures to ensure clear channels of communication to stakeholders if a crisis arises, with the public relations division serving as the designated gateway for external communications.In the event of an emergency, all departments immediately deploy emergency response measures to eliminate or minimize the impact on personnel safety, the surrounding environment, and company property and manufacturing operations. Responders also alert the public relations division at the earliest stages to ensure timely, clear and consistent communication regarding the situation.Risks Associated with Change in ManagementIn 2022 and as of the date of this Annual Report, there were no such risks for TSMC.Risks Regarding Non-Compliance with Export Control, Environmental and Climate Change Related Laws, Regulations and Accords, and Failure to Timely Obtain Requisite Approvals Necessary for Conducting BusinessBecause TSMC engages in manufacturing activities in multiple jurisdictions and conducts business with its customers located worldwide, such activities are subject to a myriad of governmental regulations. For example, the manufacturing, assembling and testing of TSMC’s products require the use of equipment that is subject to export control laws and regulations, as well as metals, chemicals, and materials that are subject to environmental, climate-related, health and safety, and humanitarian forced labor prohibition and conflict-free sourcing laws, regulations and guidelines issued worldwide. The Company’s failure to comply with any such laws or regulations, as amended from time to time, or its failure to comply with any information and document sharing requests from the relevant authorities in a timely manner could result in:●significant penalties and legal liabilities, such as the denial of import or export permits or third party private lawsuits, criminal or administrative proceedings;●the temporary or permanent suspension of production of the affected products;●the temporary or permanent inability to procure or use certain production critical chemicals or materials;●unfavorable alterations in TSMC’s manufacturing, fabrication and assembly and test processes;●challenges from its customers that place TSMC at a significant competitive disadvantage, such as loss of actual or potential sales contracts in case the Company is unable to satisfy the applicable legal standard or customer requirement;●restrictions on TSMC’s operations or sales;●loss of tax benefits, including termination of current tax incentives, disqualification of tax credit application and repayment of the tax benefits that the Company is not entitled to; and●damages to TSMC’s goodwill and reputation.Complying with applicable laws and regulations, such as environmental and climate related laws and regulations, could also require TSMC, among other things, to do the following: (1) purchase, use or install remedial equipment; (2) implement remedial programs such as climate change mitigation programs; (3) modify its product designs and manufacturing processes, or incur other significant expenses such as paying any incurred carbon fees if the Company’s emission levels exceed applicable thresholds, and obtaining renewable energy sources, renewable energy certificates or carbon credits, substitute raw materials or chemicals that may cost more or be less available for the Company’s operations.TSMC’s inability to timely obtain approvals necessary for the conduct of its business could impair its operational and financial results. For example, if the Company is unable to timely obtain environmental related approvals needed to undertake the development and construction of a new fab or expansion project, then such inability may delay, limit, or increase the cost of its expansion plans that could also in turn adversely affect its business and operational results. In light of increased public interest in environmental issues, TSMC’s operations and expansion plans may be adversely affected or delayed responding to public concern and social environmental pressures even if the Company complies with all applicable laws and regulations.TSMC believes that climate change should be regarded as a significant corporate risk that must be managed to improve competitiveness. For TSMC’s climate change related risks and control measures, see the Climate Change and Energy Management section under “7.2.1 Environmental Protection” on page 156-157 of this Annual Report.6.3.4 Financial RisksEconomic RisksAny future systemic political, economic or financial crisis or market volatility, including but not limited to interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, inflation or deflation and changes in economic, fiscal and monetary policies in major economies, could cause revenue or profits for the semiconductor industry as a whole to decline dramatically, and if the economic conditions or financial conditions of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, the demand for its products and services may decrease and additional accounting related allowances may be required, which could reduce our operating income and net income. For example, starting in March 2023, the capital and credit markets have experienced volatility and disruption as a result of the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank as well as UBS’ announced acquisition of Credit Suisse. Concerns about the soundness of the banking system may cause small- and medium-sized banks to tighten their lending to preserve liquidity, which in turn could weigh on economic growth. If such levels of market volatility and disruption continue or escalate into systematic financial crisis or global economic downturn, it could result in a number of adverse follow-on effects on TSMC, including decreased customer demand, delays in the payment of account receivables to us, and insolvency of suppliers or customers.144145●Interest Rate FluctuationTSMC is exposed to interest rate risks primarily in relation to its investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and fixed income securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as the interest paid on its debt.The objective of TSMC’s investment policy is to achieve a return that will allow the Company to preserve principal and support liquidity requirements. The policy generally requires the Company to invest in investment grade securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. TSMC’s cash and cash equivalents, as well as fixed income investments in both fixed- and floating-rate securities, carry a degree of interest rate risk. The majority of TSMC’s fixed income investments are fixed-rate securities, which are classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, and may have their fair value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates. At the same time, if interest rates fall, cash and cash equivalents as well as floating-rate securities may generate less interest income than expected.TSMC has entered and may in the future enter into interest rate derivatives to partially hedge interest rate risk on its fixed income investments and anticipated debt issuance. However, these hedges can offset only a limited portion of the financial impact from movements in interest rates.The majority of TSMC’s long-term debt is fixed-rate and measured at amortized cost and, as such, changes in interest rates would not affect future cash flows or the carrying amount.Certain of TSMC’s fixed income investments are primarily based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which will be replaced by alternative benchmark rates after June 30, 2023. The transition from LIBOR to alternative benchmark rates might result in a reduction in TSMC’s interest income.●Foreign Exchange VolatilitySubstantially all of TSMC’s sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and over half of its capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than the NT dollar, primarily in U.S. dollars, Euros and Japanese yen. As a result, any significant fluctuations to its disadvantage in the exchange rate of the NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on the Company’s revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollars. For example, every one percent depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar would result in an approximately 0.4 percentage point decrease in the Company’s operating margin based on its 2022 results.Conversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly versus other major currencies, the demand for the products and services of TSMC’s customers and for its goods and services will likely decrease, which will negatively affect the Company’s revenue.TSMC uses foreign currency derivative contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-NT-dollar-denominated assets and liabilities and certain forecasted transactions. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on its assets and liabilities.Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the NT dollar may affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s common shares and the market price of the Company’s American Depositary Shares (ADSs) as well as any cash dividends paid in NT dollar on TSMC’s common shares represented by ADSs.●InflationTSMC is subject to the effects of inflation through increases in the cost of raw materials used to produce our products, wage expenses and employee benefits, and costs in relation to construction of fabs. Although TSMC does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations to date, a high inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to maintain current levels of profit margin if the selling prices of its products and services do not increase with these increased costs.Amendments to Tax Regulations or Implementation of New Tax LawsAny amendments to existing tax regulations or the implementation of any new tax laws in the jurisdictions in which TSMC operates its business may have an adverse effect on its net income.While the Company is subject to tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which it operates or conducts business, TSMC’s principal operations are in the R.O.C. and it is exposed primarily to taxes levied by the R.O.C. government. The R.O.C. Controlled Foreign Company (“CFC”) rules enacted in 2016 have been implemented since January 1, 2023, pursuant to which, certain profits retained at a CFC located in a low-tax jurisdiction would be taxable at its parent company in Taiwan. On the other hand, effective from January 1, 2023, the R.O.C. Statute for Industrial Innovation was amended such that eligible companies that develop innovative technologies domestically and possess leading position in global supply chain may claim investment tax credit of 25% on qualified R&D expenditure and 5% on procurement of machinery/equipment for advanced processes over a fiscal year. The Company anticipates that it will be eligible for these new incentives pursuant to the R.O.C. Statute for Industrial Innovation. Additionally, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project that was undertaken by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). These changes may increase tax uncertainty and have an adverse effect on TSMC’s operating results. In order to control tax risk, the Company closely monitors all domestic and foreign governmental policies and regulations that might impact its financial operations. TSMC has established risk management procedures to collect information, analyze potential tax implications, and develop countermeasures.Risks Associated with External FinancingIn times of market instability, sufficient external financing may not be available to the Company on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms to the Company, or at all. If sufficient external financing is not available when TSMC needs such financing to meet its capital requirements, the Company may be forced to curtail its expansion, modify plans or delay the deployment of new or expanded services until it obtains such financing.Risks Associated with High-Risk/Highly Leveraged Investments; Lending, Endorsements, and Guarantees for Other Parties; and Financial Derivative TransactionsIn 2022 and as of the date of this annual report, TSMC made no high-risk or highly leveraged financial investments. All financial derivative transactions engaged by TSMC were strictly for hedging and not for trading or speculative purposes. All guarantees and intercompany loans provided by TSMC and TSMC’s subsidiaries were solely for TSMC and/or TSMC’s wholly-owned subsidiaries. All guarantees and intercompany loans were in compliance with relevant rules and regulations.To manage risks of various financial transactions, TSMC has established internal control policies and procedures based on sound financial and business practices, all in compliance with the relevant rules and regulations issued by the R.O.C. Financial Supervisory Commission. TSMC’s policies and procedures include “Procedures for Financial Derivatives Transactions,” “Procedures for Lending Funds to Other Parties,” “Procedures for Acquisition or Disposal of Assets,” and “Procedures for Endorsement and Guarantee.”Risks Associated with Impairment ChargesUnder Taiwan-IFRSs, TSMC is required to evaluate its tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. If certain criteria are met, TSMC is required to record an impairment charge. TSMC is not able to estimate the extent or timing of any impairment charge for future years. Any impairment charge required may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s net income.The determination of an impairment charge at any given time is mainly based on the projected results of operations over several years subsequent to that time. Consequently, an impairment charge is more likely to occur during a period when the Company’s operating results are otherwise already depressed. See “Note 5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION AND UNCERTAINTY” in Annual Report section (II), Financial Statements for a discussion of how TSMC assesses if an impairment charge is required and, if so, how the amount is determined.6.3.5 Other RisksPotential Impact and Risks Associated with Sales of Significant Numbers of Shares by TSMC’s Directors, and/or Shareholders Who Own 10% or More of TSMC’s Total Outstanding SharesThe value of TSMC shareholders’ investment may be reduced by possible future sales of TSMC shares owned by major shareholders.As of the date of this Annual Report, no single shareholder owned 10% or more of TSMC’s total outstanding shares.Risks of Trade PoliciesAs TSMC’s revenue is primarily derived from sales to major economies in the world (please refer to “2.2.4 TSMC Position, Differentiation and Strategy” on page 18-20 of this annual report), any changes in the trade policies (such as the increase of tariffs on certain products, the implementation of import and export controls, and the adoption of other trade barriers) of such major economies can affect the sales of TSMC or its customers and thereby affect TSMC’s operating results.146147In May 2020 and again in August 2020, the U.S. tightened its export control measures against Huawei Technology Co. Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, “Huawei”), including an expanded license requirement for providing Huawei with items subject to the U.S. export control jurisdiction. To comply with relevant laws and regulations, we have discontinued shipment of products to Huawei since September 15, 2020. Since February 2022, there have been expansive measures, including sanctions and export controls, imposed by several countries and regions against Russia, including certain individuals and entities, in connection with the military conflict in Ukraine. In October 2022, the U.S. adopted additional export controls over China on advanced computing integrated circuits (“ICs”), computer commodities that contain such ICs, and certain semiconductor manufacturing items, as well as controls on transactions involving items for supercomputer and semiconductor manufacturing end-uses. The new controls add new license requirements for items destined to a semiconductor fabrication facility in China that fabricates ICs meeting specified advanced node parameters as well as U.S. persons’ activities supporting such facility or semiconductor manufacturing like TSMC, will be decided on a case-by-case basis. In the same month, we secured a one-year general authorization from the U.S. government, which allows us to maintain the Company’s fab’s operations in Nanjing, China. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue securing such general authorization on a timely basis or at all. On the other hand, measures adopted by an affected country to counteract the impact of another country’s actions or regulations could lead to significant legal liability to multinational corporations including our own. For example, in January 2021, China adopted a blocking statute that, among other matters, entitles Chinese entities incurring damages from a multinational’s compliance with foreign laws to seek civil remedies.Imposition of trade barriers, including protectionist measures, sanctions and import and export controls, could increase our manufacturing costs, limit our access to certain supplies, make our pricing less competitive, and impact the sales of TSMC or its customers. In 2022 and as of the date of this annual report, our current results of operations have not been materially affected. Nevertheless, depending on future developments of global trade tensions, such relevant regulations, rules, or measures may have an adverse impact on our business and operations, and we may incur significant legal liability and financial losses as a result.TSMC continues to monitor the recent shifts in trade policies and measures among the relevant major economies and will take corresponding responsive actions in accordance with subsequent developments.Other Material RisksIn 2022 and as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC’s management was not aware of any other risk that could potentially have a material impact on the financial status of the Company.1501517.1 OverviewAs a long-term trusted technology and capacity provider of the global logic IC industry, TSMC is dedicated to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. The Company collaborates with all stakeholders – employees, shareholders/investors, customers, suppliers/contractors, government/industry associations and society – to create sustainability value by pursuing three primary missions: acting with integrity, strengthening environmental protection, and caring for the disadvantaged.Guidance for the Implementation of ESGIn keeping with its vision of Uplifting Society, TSMC’s ESG policy is the overarching guiding principle for sustainable development. The ESG Matrix, set by TSMC’s founder Dr. Morris Chang, clearly defines the scope of the Company’s ESG responsibility. Echoing the goal of “Bettering the Society,” TSMC strives to demonstrate its ESG commitment in seven areas including morality, business ethics, economy, rule of law, sustainability, work-life balance and happiness, and philanthropy. Actions that TSMC has taken to fulfill these commitments are integrity, law compliance, anti-corruption/anti-bribery/anti-cronyism, environmental protection/climate control/energy conservation, corporate governance, providing well-paying jobs, good shareholder return, employees’ work-life balance, encouraging innovation and good work environment. TSMC also devotes to social participations through TSMC Charity Foundation and TSMC Education and Culture Foundation.TSMC ESG MatrixSocietyTSMC MoralityBusiness EthicsEconomyRule of LawSustainabilityWork/Life Balance HappinessPhilanthropyIntegrity VVLaw Compliance VAnti-CorruptionAnti-BriberyAnti-CronyismVVVEnvironmental ProtectionClimate ControlEnergy Conservation VVCorporate Governance VVVProvide Well-Paying Jobs VVGood Shareholder Return VEmployees’ Work-Life BalanceVEncourage Innovation VVGood Work Environment VTSMC Charity Foundation VVVTSMC Education and Culture Foundation VVVESG ManagementThe ESG Steering Committee is chaired by TSMC’s Chairman, while the Chairperson of the ESG committee serves as Executive Secretary, and senior executives from a wide variety of functions – all work together to examine ESG material issues in relation to the Company’s operations, set the short-, medium- and long-term strategic directions that link to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).The ESG Committee functions to coordinate and integrate resources, and facilitate the communications among different divisions, implementing the resolutions of the Company’s ESG Steering Committee. The ESG Department, on behalf of the ESG Committee, works together with cross-organizational representatives to identify key sustainability issues in relation to the Company’s operations and stakeholders’ concern. Task forces are formed based on various issues to frame adaptive strategies, goals and action plans. The committee holds quarterly meetings to track progress and ensure the strategies are implemented effectively in daily operations.The Board of Directors supervises and guides the Company’s sustainability management, strategies, and goals. The ESG Committee Chairperson reports quarterly to the Board of Directors on the implementation of plans and results. In 2022, TSMC focused primarily on green manufacturing and supply chain management (including net zero emission, renewable energy access and use, and low-carbon value chain management), workplace diversity & inclusion and talent development (including employee resource groups, diversity and inclusion practices for R&D talents, Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) programs for high school girls), sustainability disclosures in sustainability report, theme reports such as TCFD Repot, UN SDGs Action Report and Materiality Analysis Report, sustainable culture advocacy (i.e., TSMC ESG awards), empowerment projects in remote areas and 2021 ESG spending updates, etc.Stakeholder EngagementTSMC respects all stakeholders’ rights and interests in sustainability issues. The Company thus deploys multiple communication venues including a dedicated ESG website, ESG mailbox, Investor mailbox, Employee Feedback Channels, Irregular Business Conduct Reporting System, and the Supply Chain Worker Grievance Channel, etc. Through identification, prioritization and validation, TSMC manages and addresses stakeholders’ concerns.Stakeholders and Communication Channels in 2022StakeholdersCommunication ChannelsEmployees●Corporate intranet (myTSMC), internal emails, and other announcement channels (such as promotion posters at facilities), TSMC Newsletter eSilicon Garden●Human resources team●Employee training●Communication meetings for various levels of managers and employees;

The TSMC Sustainability Report (formerly the Corporate Social Responsibility Report) aligns with the global sustainability standards and identifies ESG material issues in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Integrating Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) with ESG management, TSMC demonstrates how the Company evaluates ESG risk trends and impacts, mitigates accordingly through innovative thinking and practices, and operates sustainably at TSMC Taiwan Facilities (headquarters, wafer fabs, back-end packaging fabs, and testing fabs located in Taiwan), TSMC China, TSMC Nanjing, TSMC Arizona, Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing, Inc., WaferTech, VisEra and other subsidiaries. In addition to GRI, the report also adopts TCFD Recommendations, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) reporting standards, AA1000 Accountability Principle and is assured by DNV GL Business Assurance Co.

The committee members include site directors, managers of safety and health department, and representatives from wellness, HR and legal affairs divisions. External experts have also been invited to discuss the potential risks of occupational diseases in the semiconductor manufacturing process and prevention plans for such diseases. To mitigate health risks to employees, suppliers and contractors in the workplace, TSMC has adopted rigorous safety and health control measures focused on preventing occupational injuries and diseases and promoting employee safety, physical and mental health.To minimize the supply chain risk and fulfill corporate social responsibility, TSMC not only follows ESH best practices internally but also strives to improve the ESH performance of its suppliers and contractors through audits and counselling.TSMC uses priority work management and self-management to govern services provided by contractors. The Company requires contractors performing level-one high-risk operations to complete certification for technicians and to establish their own ISO 45001 safety and health management system. The emphasis on self-management nurtures the sense of responsibility, with the goal of promoting safety awareness and technical improvement for all contractors in the industry. For onsite contractor personnel, TSMC has standardized courses on safety and health and increased the frequency of such courses to improve training effectiveness and safety awareness. To ensure the Company’s safety protocols are accurately delivered to contractors on a timely basis, TSMC has established a digital platform for mutual communication so that onsite operational risks can be mitigated.TSMC collaborates with suppliers to manage the sustainability of the supply chain, including formulating supplier sustainability standards, drawing up audit plans, performing audits and tracking improvements, coaching and training, and re-coaching for suppliers with poor performance. Strengthening the professional capabilities of suppliers in environmental protection, safety and health, fire response, and carbon inventory were key focuses in 2022, as the Company held the environmental protection, safety and health workshops (56 participants from 50 suppliers), fire emergency response workshops (58 participants from 50 suppliers), and product carbon footprint inventory workshop (24 participants from 20 suppliers). In addition, for the past seven years suppliers have been invited to observe TSMC’s annual emergency response drills (166 participants from 161 suppliers) 18 months of receiving their facility license. In 2022, all TSMC fabs in Taiwan completed the renewal of ISO 14001, ISO 45001, and TOSHMS certificates with three year validity. At the same time, three new fabs, Fab 12 Phase 8, Fab 18B and Advanced Backend Fab 6, also passed third-party verification and obtained certificates.To reduce overall environmental, safety and health risks, TSMC strives for continuous improvement and actively seeks to enhance climate-change management, pollution prevention and control, power and resource conservation, waste reduction and recycling, safety and health management, and fire and explosion prevention as well as to minimize the impact of earthquake damage.In order to meet regulatory and customer requirements for the management of hazardous materials, TSMC has adopted the IECQ QC 080000 hazardous substance process management (HSPM) system. All TSMC Fabs have been QC 080000 certified and maintained validity since 2007. Through the establishment of QC 080000, TSMC ensures that its products comply with international regulatory and customer requirements, including the European Union’s “Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive,” the EU’s “Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH),” the “Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer,” the “halogen-free in electronic products” initiative, perfluorooctane sulfonates (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and related substances restriction standards. In addition, in 2016 TSMC started a project to minimize usage of the hazardous substance N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) and as a result by the end of 2022 NMP use in the Company’s Taiwan fabs had been reduced by 97.2% compared to 2016, and achieved 2022’s 95% reduction goal. TSMC will continue to further reduce NMP usage in its subsidiary fabs.In 2011, TSMC began implementing the ISO 50001 energy management system for continuous improvement in energy conservation. As of 2022, all TSMC and its subsidiaries’ manufacturing facilities had received ISO 50001 Energy Management System certification except for one. The Company’s WaferTech subsidiary in the U.S. was originally scheduled to receive this certification in 2021 but it has been postponed to 2023 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.Aiming to establish the healthiest possible workplace, in 2017 TSMC formed a corporate-level health promotion committee led by managers at the vice president level to meet on an 156157and the Company’s environmental, safety and health sustainability forum focused on successful case sharing (354 participants from 116 suppliers). TSMC also conducts environmental, safety and health audits at suppliers’ manufacturing sites and actively assists suppliers in improving their ESH performance. Finally, the Company requests that suppliers conduct a carbon emissions inventory and encourages them to implement measures to save energy, reduce carbon emissions, conserve water and reduce waste. 7.2.1 Environmental ProtectionClimate Change and Energy Management●Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)In view of the potential financial risks of climate change on operations, in 2018 TSMC adopted TCFD recommendations released by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to identify risks and opportunities and further establish metrics and target management based on the results identified.Management Structure of TSMC Climate-related Risks and OpportunitiesCategoryManagement Strategy and ActionsGovernanceBoard of Directors periodically reviews climate change related risks and opportunities●ESG steering committee led by the Chairman is the Company’s top organization dealing with climate change management.

In 2021, TSMC announced its long-term goal of net zero emissions by 2050, while setting the short-term goal of zero growth in emissions by 2025. By actively implementing emission reduction measures, the Company is working to return its carbon emissions to 2020 levels by 2030. TSMC remains committed to becoming a global leader in green manufacturing.TSMC actively participates in the initiatives of the World Semiconductor Council (WSC) and has leveraged its past experience to develop best practices to reduce perfluorinated compounds (PFC) emissions, measures that have been fully adopted and implemented since 2012. In 2013, in accordance with the “EPA Early Actions for Carbon Credit of Greenhouse Gases Reduction” regulation, TSMC applied for recognition of GHG reduction from 2005 to 2011 and received 5.28 million tons of carbon dioxide credits in 2015. Those carbon credits can be used to offset GHG emissions of new manufacturing facilities regulated by Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Act, which can support the Company’s sustainable operations and mitigate climate-change risk.Since 2005, TSMC has completed the GHG inventory program and taken a complete inventory of its GHG emissions to gain ISO 14064 certification. The inventory shows that the major direct GHG emissions are PFCs, which are widely used in the semiconductor manufacturing process. The primary indirect GHG emission is electricity consumption. The analysis of the inventory data is not only to meet domestic regulatory reporting requirements but also to serve as a baseline reference for the Company’s strategy to reduce GHG emissions. Since 2005, TSMC has also participated in the international disclosure and rating agency – CDP to publicly disclose climate change information for 18 consecutive years and to continuously review and improve related management practices.In response to the commitment of global climate summit “Paris Agreement” and the Republic of China’s “Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act” promulgated in 2015, TSMC initiated a cross-functional platform for carbon management in 2016. The three areas of focus of this platform are legal compliance, emission reduction, and carbon credit acquisition. In addition to participating in official regulatory consultation and communications meetings, the Company also sets short-, medium- and long-term reduction targets through the energy and carbon reduction committee led by the fab operations vice president. The measures are carried out by energy and carbon reduction teams of individual fabs. Because more than 75% of TSMC’s GHG emissions come from electricity consumption, the Company emphasizes energy conservation and carbon reduction initiatives. TSMC has not only implemented energy-conserving designs in its manufacturing fabs and offices but has also continuously improved the energy efficiency in operating its facilities. These efforts simultaneously reduce carbon dioxide gas emissions and costs. As a result, TSMC has conserved 3.1 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of power since 2016. In February 2023, Taiwan renamed the “Greenhouse (Continued)158159Gas Reduction and Management Act” to the “Climate Change Response Act” and amended the provisions. Relevant laws and regulations will be formulated in the future. TSMC will continue to pay attention to and evaluate the company’s impact, so as to respond early.From 2015 to 2017, TSMC voluntarily participated in the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic Affairs’ green power purchasing program and became the largest buyer in Taiwan, purchasing 400 million kilowatt hours (kWh) of green power. Although the Taiwan Power Company stopped selling green power in 2018, TSMC still aggressively negotiates the purchase of renewable energy with other suppliers in Taiwan. Targeting a long-term commitment of 100% renewable energy, TSMC has committed to achieving 40% renewable energy by 2030. Since 2018, the overseas manufacturing fabs and offices have purchased renewable energy, REC and carbon credits to offset all carbon emissions caused by power consumption. All TSMC overseas sites achieved zero carbon emission of electricity consumption in 2022 again. TSMC also used carbon credits to offset carbon emissions of natural gas consumption in kitchens, achieving the milestone of net zero emissions for TSMC global offices. Although development of renewable energy in Taiwan is in an early stage, TSMC has established a renewable energy task force and continues to communicate closely with government through the Association of Science Park Industries and Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association. The Company has made recommendations to the government in the hope that the collaboration would speed up renewable energy development in Taiwan. The recommendations include expanding the development of offshore wind power and increasing the supply of the renewable energy trading platform. TSMC continues to find renewable energy. By the end of 2022, the total installation capacity of renewable energy contracted reached 2.9 GW (Gigawatts). The renewable energy will be provided to TSMC gradually after the related business process has been completed. This is a clear manifestation of the Company’s active support of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).In 2020 TSMC became the first semiconductor company to join RE100 (the global corporate renewable energy initiative) and pledged that power consumption of all the Company’s manufacturing plants and offices will be 100% supplied from renewable energy by 2050.TSMC GHG Emissions in Recent Two YearsUnit: Metric ton CO2 equivalentYearScopeScope 1Scope 2Verification PartyVerification StatusTotal Emissions (Metric Ton CO2e)Intensity (Metric Ton CO2e / K NTD)Total Emissions (Metric Ton CO2e)Intensity (Metric Ton CO2e / K NTD)2022Parent Company1,669,7380.00079,540,1710.0042DNVUnder VerificationVisEra Technologies Company Ltd.5,8450.000629,6830.0033DNVUnder VerificationTSMC China Company Limited187,1810.006600DNVUnder VerificationTSMC Nanjing Company Limited46,2090.001100DNVUnder VerificationWaferTech, LLC109,7840.010700AWNUnder Verification2021Parent Company1,808,4270.00118,116,4390.0052DNVReasonable AssuranceVisEra Technologies Company Ltd.7,2820.000839,0570.0043DNVReasonable AssuranceTSMC China Company Limited196,8340.009300DNVReasonable AssuranceTSMC Nanjing Company Limited29,7780.001100DNVReasonable AssuranceWaferTech, LLC105,3460.013600AWNLimited AssuranceNote 1: GHG includes CO2, CH4, N2O, HCFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3Note 2:  Scope 1:  Direct emissions, i.e. sources owned or controlled by the Company; according to the 2019 Refinement to the Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gases Inventories of the United Nations; and use the Global Warming Potential (GWP) referring to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR5 for calculation Scope 2: Indirect emissions, i.e. those arising from externally purchased electricity, heat or steam.

In addition, TSMC maintains backup pollution control systems, including emergency power supplies, to lower the risk of pollutant emissions in the event of equipment failure. The Company centrally monitors the operations of its air and water pollution control equipment 24 hours a day by rotating staff and treats system effectiveness as an important tracking item to ensure the quality of emitted air and discharged water.TSMC uses an intranet website to collect and measure water recycling volumes company-wide. To make the most effective use of Taiwan’s limited water resources, all TSMC fabs strive to increase water reclamation by adjusting the water usage of manufacturing equipment and improving wastewater reclamation. The long-term target is a 30% decrease by 2030. By 2022, TSMC’s unit product water consumption had decreased by 2.6% from 2010 levels. Challenges in 2022 included new wafer fab (Fab 18B), which was in the process of setting up, so water conservation rate decreased as the production line was still in the testing stage and production had not yet reached economic scale. Excluding the aforementioned new wafer fab, the Company’s water consumption per unit of product decreased by 15.6% compared with the base year, and the annual target was achieved. All TSMC fabs meet or exceed the process water reclamation rate standard of the Science Park Administration. Some fabs are able to reclaim more than 90% of process water, outperforming most semiconductor fabs around the world. The Company also makes every effort to reduce non-manufacturing-related water consumption, including water used in air conditioning systems, sanitary facilities, wall cleaning and landscaping activities and in kitchens. Since water resources are restricted by geographical conditions, TSMC shares its water saving experience and expertise with other semiconductor companies through the Association of Science-Based Industrial Park to promote water conservation in order to achieve Science Park’s goals and ensure a long-term balance of supply and demand. In addition, TSMC has committed to further recycling water resources and supporting the government policy and promotion of reclaimed water. TSMC’s Southern Taiwan Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant began operation on September 19, 2022, the first private reclaimed water plant in Taiwan. Introducing reclaimed water into the manufacturing process is pioneering work in the semiconductor industry. TSMC promises to continue to increase the utilization of reclaimed water in newly constructed fabs in the future.To further enhance water resources management, TSMC has adopted and followed the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) standard, the world’s only sustainable water management standard. Early in 2022, Fab 12A, Fab 12B, Fab 5, located in Hsinchu Science Park, and Advanced Backend Fab 3 in Longtan Science Park passed a third-party verification audit and also obtained AWS platinum level certification. TSMC’s advanced product fabs in Taiwan’s three major Science Parks have all achieved AWS platinum certification. TSMC is the world’s first to do so in the semiconductor industry.TSMC Water Usage in Recent Two YearsYearTotal Water Usage (m3) (Note 1)Unit Product Water Usage (L/12-inch wafer-e-layer)2022104,681,272137.3202182,674,982119.7TSMC Water Usage Reduction Target and Achievement StatusStrategy2030 Goal2022 Target and AchievementAchievement StatusEnforce climate change mitigation policies, implement water conservation and water shortage adaptation measuresReduce unit water consumption (liter/12-inch equivalent wafer mask layer) by 30% (Base year: 2010)Reduced unit water consumption by 2.6% (Target: 16%)Unachieved (Note 2)Note 1: Includes TSMC fabs in Taiwan and SubsidiariesNote 2:  Excluding the impact of new plants (Fab 18B) not yet optimized, TSMC reduced water consumption per unit of product by 15.6%.160161Waste Management and RecyclingIn recent years, as TSMC continued to develop advanced processes and expand capacity rapidly both at home in Taiwan and overseas, waste production has increased due to the complexity of new process development, demand for reliable yield rates, and increasing use of raw materials. To achieve the goal of sustainable resource utilization, TSMC has a designated unit responsible for waste recycling and disposal. The priorities are process waste reduction, onsite and offsite recycling and regeneration, with incineration and landfill as least desirable final options. In 2017, TSMC amended its articles of incorporation to add four business items for chemical materials to ensure waste flow and reduce risks of improper waste disposal by commissioned agencies. It also set up onsite resource activation facilities to convert waste resources produced by processing activities into products to be used onsite or to sell to other factories. In 2021, TSMC recycled waste copper sulfate, cobalt-containing liquid, waste sulfuric acid and waste ammonium sulfate, all of which were regenerated into products. The Company also developed the system of cryolite synthesis whereby waste hydrogen fluoride (HF) is recycled and regenerated into raw material used in other industries. As a result, the Company has become a leader in waste resources regeneration. In 2022, TSMC became the first company in the semiconductor industry to use anaerobic digestion technology to reuse organic sludge in order to generate green electricity and implement green manufacturing. At the same time, TSMC’s fabs in Taiwan achieved a 95% waste recycling rate for the eighth consecutive year, with a landfill rate below 1% for the thirteenth consecutive year. Furthermore, Fab 12 earned the platinum UL 2799 certification, the highest grade for zero landfill in 2021. All TSMC facilities in Taiwan plan to obtain UL 2799 certification in 2023.TSMC Waste Quantity and Outsourced Unit Waste Disposal in Recent Two Years (Note 1)YearOutsourced General Waste (ton) (Note 2)Outsourced Hazardous Waste (ton) (Note 2)Outsourced Unit Waste Disposal (Note 3)(kg/12-inch equivalent wafer mask layer)2022342,804401,2150.992021335,080339,6230.99Note 1:  The data in the table are preliminary results collected by TSMC and have not yet been verified by a third partyNote 2: Totals include Taiwan and subsidiary facilitiesNote 3: Taiwan facilitiesbenefit evaluation calculates cost savings for energy conservation, water or waste reductions and recycling benefits in accordance with its environmental protection programs.

The Company has also continued to upgrade existing office buildings to comply with the LEED standard each year. From 2008 to 2022, 40 of TSMC’s fabs and office buildings achieved LEED certifications: three platinum and 37 gold. During this time, the Company also received six Taiwan Intelligent Building diamond-class certifications and 28 Taiwan Ecology, Energy saving, Waste reduction and Health (EEWH) certifications: 21 diamond, five gold and two silver. Since 2009, the Company has been a leading supporter of the Taiwan government’s Green Factory Label standard, including the Clean Production and Factory Green Building evaluation systems. TSMC received Taiwan’s first Green Factory Label and 14 labels in total as of the end of 2022 and is the most awarded company in Taiwan.Environmental Audit Results in Violation of Environmental RegulationsIn 2022 and as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC has had no environmental regulation violations.TSMC Waste Reduction Target and Achievement StatusStrategy2030 Goal2022 Target and AchievementAchievement StatusPromote waste reduction by source separation and require vendors to provide low chemical consumption equipmentOutsourced unit waste disposal per wafer ≦0.50 (kg/12-inch equivalent wafer mask layer)Outsourced unit waste disposal per wafer 0.99 (kg/12-inch equivalent wafer mask layer) (Target: ≦0.99%)ExceededIn order to ensure that all waste is treated and recycled properly, TSMC closely tracks the recycling and reuse practices of its cleanup and disposal vendors. The Company carefully selects waste disposal and recycling vendors that have certificates and permits, regularly checks the onsite operational status, disposal declaration forms, operational records, etc., compares with actual reuse and disposal, and takes proactive steps to strengthen vendor auditing. For example, all waste transportation contractors have agreed to join the GPS Satellite Fleet so that the cleanup transportation routes and abnormal stays for all trucks can be traced. All waste recycling and disposal vendors have installed closed-circuit TV systems at operating sites to monitor and audit waste handling. At the same time, to further guarantee proper waste handling, TSMC built the system of waste intelligent fast track (S.W.I.F.T) and completed five different types of waste treatment vendors for pilot testing in 2022. TSMC intends to roll out SWIFT to all waste treatment vendors in 2025. By using Artificial Intelligent technology replacing in-person on-site spot checks, the Company increases inspections efficiency by 65 times and reduces manual inspection by 13,000 hours each year. In addition, TSMC also conducts ongoing surveys of recycled product tracking and requires all recycling contractors to report their recycled product sales monthly to track waste flow and ensure that actions are taken to adhere to lawful and proper waste recycling and treatment.Environmental AccountingThe purpose of TSMC’s environmental accounting system is to identify and quantify environmental costs for internal management. At the same time, the Company also evaluates the savings or economic benefits of environmental protection programs so as to continuously promote economically effective programs. While environmental expenses are expected to continue to rise, environmental accounting can help manage these costs more effectively. TSMC’s environmental accounting measures various environmental costs, establishes independent environmental account codes, and provides the data to all units for use in annual budgeting.

All TSMC fabs in Taiwan have received Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System (TOSHMS) certification since 2009. In 2018, the International Organization for Standardization released ISO 45001: 2018, replacing OHSAS 18001, with major changes in the expansion of the scope, support and participation of the leadership, collection and planning of internal and external issues, the expectations and demands of stakeholders, the assessment of risk inspections, communication and consultation with non-managers, the application of performance indicators, and the evaluation of corrective and preventive actions. Meanwhile, ISO 45001 ensures the spirit of the system can be effectively implemented at the management level through management review, internal audit, automatic check, and security patrol to identify safety concerns and opportunities for improvement. All Company fabs in Taiwan received ISO 45001 certification for occupational health and safety in 2019 and all TSMC subsidiaries obtained the certification in 2020. All the above certifications have been maintained. New facilities are required to receive aforementioned certifications within 18 months after receiving facility license per TSMC’s internal policy.Besides accident prevention, TSMC has established emergency response procedures to protect employees and contractors if a disaster should occur, as well as to prevent and/or reduce the negative impact on the community and the environment. TSMC communicates regularly with suppliers to ensure that potential risk in the operation of production equipment is minimized and that safety control procedures are followed rigorously during installation. The Company places stringent controls on high-risk operations and also evaluates the seismic tolerance of its facilities and equipment to reduce the risk of earthquake damage.For epidemics, TSMC has established corporate-level prevention committees and procedures for emergency response to outbreaks of infectious diseases.Working Environment and Employee Safety and Health ProtectionThe Company’s ESH policy is focused on establishing a safe working environment, preventing occupational injury and illness, keeping employees healthy, enhancing every employee’s awareness and sense of accountability to ESH, and building a strong ESH culture.There were a total of 35 occupational injuries at TSMC in 2022, involving 35 people, representing approximately 0.04% of the total number of employees. The disabling injury frequency rate (FR) was 0.27, under the 0.4 target, and the disability injury severity rate (SR) was 3, meeting the target of less than 4. In response, TSMC is reviewing potential improvement measures, such as interlocking devices for machine safety, as well as standard safety operation procedures. In addition to regular reviews, the caring program for employees has been enhanced and managers have been directed to pay closer attention to the physical and mental state of employees to ensure their safety and health during their work.TSMC safety and health management operations apply to the following:●Equipment Safety and Health Management In addition to meeting regulatory requirements and internal standards, as well as mitigating ESH-related risks when building or expanding facilities, TSMC also maintains procedures governing new equipment and raw materials, requires safety approvals for bringing new tools online, updates safety rules, and implements seismic protection and other safety measures.TSMC requires that all new tools meet SEMI-S8 requirements and that appropriate supplementary control measures be taken to reduce ergonomic risk. Moreover, the Company endeavors to automate the transportation of 300mm front-opening unified pods (FOUPs) to prevent accumulative physical damage caused by repetitive manual handling of this equipment. TSMC 300mm fabs have all converted to automatic transportation control.●Environmental, Safety and Health Evaluation of New Tools and New Chemical SubstancesAs a technology leader in the global semiconductor industry, TSMC operates increasingly diversified process tools and introduces new chemicals in the R&D stage. Before using new tools or new chemicals, they are reviewed carefully by the new tools and new chemical review committee. The purpose is to ensure that new tools are compliant with the semiconductor industry’s safety standards (such as SEMI-S2) and that environmental, safety and health concerns about new chemicals are addressed and controlled including the use of engineering controls and personal protection equipment, as well as operational safety training during storage, transportation, usage and disposal. A total of 434 cases of new tools and chemical substances were passed by the new tool and new chemical review committee in 2022, and they were evaluated and reviewed in accordance with the aforementioned standards before entering TSMC.●General Safety Management, Training and AuditAll TSMC manufacturing facilities hold environmental, safety and health committee meetings on a monthly basis. TSMC has adopted multiple preventive measures such as controls on high-risk work, contractor management, chemical safety management, personal protective equipment requirements, and safety audit management. In addition, the Company maintains detailed disaster response procedures and performs regular drills designed to minimize injuries to employees and damage to property, as well as the impact on society and the environment in the event of a disaster.TSMC Safety-related Training and Promotion in the Recent Two YearsYearTotal Number of Employees who have Completed Safety-related Training2022271,7022021289,398●Working Environment Hazardous Factors ManagementTSMC conducts workplace hazard assessments to provide a comfortable, safe workplace to employees. The Company also educates employees and requires them, when appropriate, to use personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent hazardous exposures. The Company performs semi-annual workplace environment assessments of physical and chemical hazards, including CO2 concentration, illumination, noise, and hazardous chemical substances as regulated by local laws. In addition, TSMC performs exposure assessments and uses hierarchy management control for chemicals with potential health hazards. If abnormal measurements occur, events happen, or an exposure assessment indicates there is an adverse health 166167effect on employees, ESH professionals immediately conduct onsite observation and intervention to reduce the risk of hazardous factors exposure to acceptable levels.●Health Promotion ProgramIn order to establish the healthiest possible workplace and reduce the incidence of occupational disease, TSMC formed a corporate-level committee to carry out health promotion programs covering three key areas:1.  Exposure and health risk assessment: develop an exposure assessment system to identify high health risk employees.2.  Hazardous training and notification: use standardized training materials for employees and contractors in all TSMC fabs. Inform them of the health risks and prevention measures at the workplace before working or providing any services there.3.  Strengthen management of chemicals with significant health risks: request suppliers that all materials they provide to TSMC must comply with applicable laws including clear disclosure of any hazardous substances. Perform sampling of raw materials used in the manufacturing process to confirm that they do not contain any carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic-reproductive materials as claimed in supplier’s safety data sheet (SDS). ●Emergency ResponseThe planning and execution of an effective emergency response requires identifying potential high-risk events via risk assessment and being prepared for various scenarios. It should focus on continuous improvements and drills covering all potentially serious events. TSMC’s emergency response plans include procedures for rapid-response crisis management and disaster recovery for potential incidents.  All TSMC fabs conduct major annual emergency response exercises and evacuation drills. TSMC’s onsite service contractors are also required to participate in emergency response planning and exercises to ensure cooperation in handling accidents and to effectively minimize any damage caused by disasters. In 2022, the Company held 109 evacuation drills and 53 fire drills. At least every two years, each fab director invites fab management and support functions to participate in business continuity drills for potentially high-risk events such as earthquake, fire and flood (at the Tainan site). Since 2018, TSMC has conducted complex accident emergency response drills, which include simultaneous scenarios for earthquake, fire and chemical spills to ensure rapid response to emergencies so that losses can be minimized in the event of a real disaster. In 2020, TSMC took lead in the industry to introduce the all-hazard approach recommended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to conduct disaster prevention exercises.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, TSMC added tabletop exercises to disaster prevention training in an effort to minimize the risks of group infections that may arise as a result of full-scale exercises. The inclusion of tabletop exercises also aids in the verification of full-scale exercise procedures to make disaster response more comprehensive, thus effectively mitigating the impact of various types of disasters on business continuity in the future. As of 2022, 428 sessions of tabletop exercises had been completed in addition to 235 full-scale exercises.In addition to the regular emergency response drills held by engineering and facilities departments each quarter, the Company’s laboratory, canteen, dormitory, and shuttle bus personnel also hold emergency response drills to prepare for events such as earthquakes, chemical spills, ammonia release, fires and traffic accidents.●Emerging Infectious Disease ResponseTSMC has a dedicated corporate ESH organization to monitor emerging infectious diseases around the world, to assess any potential impact on the workplace, and to provide an appropriate strategic response plan. In previous outbreaks such as SARS in 2003, H1N1 influenza in 2009, and MERS in 2015, as well as with the current COVID-19 threat, TSMC followed the Taiwan CDC’s (Centers for Disease Control) rules and convened the corporate influenza response committee to develop the Company’s strategies. These strategies included educating employees in prevention and response, publishing guidelines for managers, establishing guidelines for employee sick leave due to flu, and installing alcohol-based hand sanitizers at appropriate locations. The Committee also monitors the status of employee leave due to illness and, at the same time, develops a continuity plan to address manpower shortages and minimize business impact. In order to protect the health of TSMC employees, their families, and work partners, employees are encouraged to be fully vaccinated if in healthy condition. In addition, TSMC reviews the situation from time to time and formulates appropriate preventive measures such as daily body temperature checks and updated vaccination information before entering Company facilities and continues to follow epidemic prevention recommendations such as mask wearing, frequent hand washing and social distancing.●Employee Physical and Mental Health EnhancementTSMC believes that employee physical and mental health is not only fundamental to maintaining sound business operations but is also an important part of a corporation’s responsibility. To preserve and promote the physical and mental health of its employees, TSMC fosters collaboration among the onsite industrial safety and environmental protection department, the onsite medical personnel of the health center, and physicians of occupational medicine. TSMC strives to reduce cerebral and cardiovascular conditions or injuries that might be induced or aggravated by overwork, night work or shift work. The Company conducts programs for maternal health protection and for prevention of cumulative trauma disorders as well. TSMC devotes significant resources to mental health awareness, focused not only on hazards at work but also on employee health in general. In 2022, through planned personal health management, (1) 543 female employees participated in the maternal health program, and the completion rate was 100%. All but one of them were at first degree risk, where there was no potential harm to the mother or infant. One woman was assessed as second degree risk, with potential harm to the mother or infant, but after proper adjustments to her work duties, her risk was downgraded to first degree. (2) Through analysis of historical cerebral and cardiovascular cases of its employees, TSMC has sharpened the disease assessment criteria used by contracted doctors, and, in combination with internal annual health examination reports and work scheduling information, the Company was able to identify 4,485 employees with middle to high risk for cerebral and cardiovascular diseases. These employees were provided with health education and medical assistance. Also, they and their managers received recommended changes in working hours and shifts to reduce health risks. (3) 201 employees were identified as high risk for cumulative trauma disorders, including one who might also have job-related risks, and the Company adjusted working conditions accordingly to reduce potential risks. (4) As obesity has been considered as a precursor to hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension and insomnia, TSMC has held health promotion programs for several consecutive years. In 2022, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and catering to the younger generation’s preference for social and video media, apart from physical weight loss activities (6,458 participants; total weight loss reached 5,322.9kg),TSMC conducted a series of online interactive activities including: three sessions of “Health Lecture Online” with 2,876 attendees in total; three health education promotion materials about Weight-loss Diets , with a total of 25,776 person-times; four sessions of online quizzes on the topics of insomnia and improving sleeping,  with a total of 16,656 attendees; and one-on-one sleep counseling 93 attendees in total. The above activities have all received positive feedback from employees. In the future, we will continue to implement relevant health promotion activities to take care of the health of employees.7.2.4 Supplier ManagementManagement AspectFor better supply chain management, TSMC is committed to communicating with and encouraging its suppliers, including contractors, to increase their quality, cost effectiveness and delivery performance, and make continuous improvement in environmental protection, safety and health. Through regular communication with senior managers, site audits and experience sharing, the Company collaborates with major suppliers and contractors to enhance partnerships and ensure continued improvement of performance and increased joint contributions to society. As noted above, contractors performing high-risk activities must lay out clearly defined safety precautions and preventative measures. In addition, contractors working on high-risk engineering projects must establish ISO 45001 or OHSAS 18001 systems and the workers must successfully complete work-related skill training. All contractors performing high-risk activities have obtained ISO 45001 certification before the end of 2021.Supply Chain SustainabilityTSMC works with suppliers in several fields of sustainable development, such as greening the supply chain, carbon management for climate change, mitigation of fire risk, ESH management and business continuity plans in the event of a natural disaster. Since becoming a full member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) in 2015, TSMC has completed implementation of the RBA code of conduct throughout the Company by performing self-assessments at its facilities worldwide and reviewing policies and procedures in the areas of labor, health and safety, environment, ethics and management systems. 168169To enhance supply chain sustainability and streamline risk management, the Company is committed to collaborating with its suppliers to maintain full compliance with Taiwan’s environmental, safety, health and fire protection regulations. TSMC developed a supplier’s code of conduct, which affirmed basic labor rights and standards for health, safety, environment, ethics and management systems. TSMC works with suppliers to evaluate the risk and impact on the economy, the environment, and society and to make continuous improvement. The Company has helped boost suppliers’ performance of sustainability through experience sharing and training and hopes to establish a world-class semiconductor supply chain that exceeds international standards and serves as a global benchmark.TSMC is subject to the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure rule on conflict minerals released under Rule 13p-1 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a recognized global leader in the high-tech supply chain, the Company acknowledges its corporate social responsibility to strive to procure conflict-free minerals in an effort to recognize humanitarian and ethical social principles that protect the dignity of all people. To this end, TSMC has implemented a series of compliance safeguards in accordance with leading industry practices such as adopting the due diligence framework in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)’s Model Supply Chain Policy for a Responsible Global Supply Chain of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High Risk Areas issued in 2011.TSMC is a strong supporter of the Responsible Business Alliance and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), which will help the Company’s suppliers source conflict-free minerals through their jointly developed Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). Since 2011, TSMC has asked its suppliers to disclose information and make timely updates on smelters and mines. The Company encourages suppliers to source minerals from facilities or smelters that have received a “conflict free” designation by a recognized industry group (such as the RBA) and also requires those who have not received such designation to become compliant with Responsible Minerals Initiative or an equivalent third-party audit program. TSMC requires the use of conflict-free tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold in its products. strengthening and broadening the quality of their instruction. In May 2022, testing of the pupils who had attended the “Teaching & Learning Project” showed that their literacy skills had improved markedly.In addition to the “Teaching & Learning Project” aimed at empowering primary school teachers, the Foundation collaborated with Chengzhi Education Foundation to sponsor the KIST education scheme at the Emei Junior High School in Hsinchu, a program that strives to bring positive change to the school. Also, together with Unitas Literary, the Foundation held the TSMC Youth Literature Camp, providing junior high school students from rural areas the opportunity to appreciate the beauty of literature in the setting of youth camps. Moreover, the Foundation continued to offer scholarships and computers to 98 outstanding students of underprivileged backgrounds at five national universities in Taiwan, freeing these students of financial burden and offering them the opportunity to study at college. The Foundation’s scholarship program truly helps students transform their lives.Nurturing ESG Talent, Empowering Women in STEM FieldsIn 2022, the Foundation continued to hold the “TSMC Udreamer” project, encouraging college students all over Taiwan to take the first step in pursuing and realizing their dreams. The project’s theme in 2022 was sustainability, chosen to encourage young college students to pay attention to issues of sustainability and contribute to the common good of the society while pursuing their dreams. The 2022 competition received proposals from 161 teams composed of 516 college students from all over Taiwan. At the final stage of the competition, eight teams of college students won the dreamer’s prize of NT$300 million and started a year-long dream-building journey. In addition, the Foundation launched the “TSMC Udreamer Mentorship” project in 2022, inviting TSMC employees to be mentors to the young dreamers by offering guidance and moral support. In total, 98 employees registered for the project, of which 15 were selected and specially trained to assist the dreamer teams to realize their dreams. In 2022, the Foundation also joined forces with National Museum of Natural Science to hold the “TSMC Female Scientists Tour” for the third consecutive year. Since the first tour, more than a thousand female high school students have TSMC will continue to conduct the supplier survey annually and require suppliers to improve and expand their disclosure to fulfill regulatory and customer requirements. For further information, see the Company’s Form SD filed with the U.S. SEC. (https://www.tsmc.com/english/investorRelations/sec_filings.htm)7.3 TSMC Education and Culture FoundationIn 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic persisted, affecting every sector in Taiwan. During this time, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation (the Foundation) responded by infusing more resources into the arts and holding numerous educational and cultural events. In addition, the Foundation teamed up with educational partners to empower teachers in rural areas; invited TSMC employees to accompany young college students to pursue their dreams; encouraged female high school students to go into Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) fields; sponsored courses that pass on traditional theater and micro courses teaching Peking opera appreciation; and joined forces with the power of science and technology to hold online cultural events. The Foundation invested over NT$99 million in 2022 to provide resources in three main areas: cultivate the young generation, educational collaboration, and promote arts and culture, thereby bringing about the positive cycle for the common good of the society and for the sustainable development.Narrowing the Gap in Resources; Supporting Education of the Economically UnderprivilegedAs part of the COVID-19 prevention measures taken in Taiwan, instruction at schools of all levels went online. Such a measure, while lessening the impact of the reduced in-person teaching, also exposed the glaring gap in educational resources between urban and rural areas. In response, the Foundation worked in tandem with the CommonWealth Magazine Education Foundation and the Prof. Hwawei Ko Reading Research Center of National Tsing Hua University to launch the “Teaching & Learning Project”, which was implemented in 48 primary schools in rural areas. This project provides first and second grade teachers, free of charge, well-researched teaching plans for reading and writing, thereby reducing the teachers’ preparation load. Moreover, a complementary online support system allowed teachers to discuss various issues with the staff at the Prof. Hwawei Ko Reading Research Center, thus participated.

In 2022, the Foundation cooperated with National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University and Guandau Hospital to establish a smart exercise club for the elderly to prevent disability and delay aging through exercise. The Foundation continued to collaborate with the TSMC facility division to repair 285 houses damaged by the earthquake in Hualien, and further ensuring 16 solitary elders a safe and healthy living space after the disaster. Current Network of Compassion partners include Taipei Municipal Gandau Hospital, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Miao-Li Hospital, Old Five Old Foundation, Fongyuan Hospital, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung City Private Lin Tseng Lien Welfare And Charity Foundation, Taiwan Puli Care Association, Sin-Lau Hospital, Tainan Municipal Hospital, Jianan Psychiatric Center Department of Health, Mennonite Christian Hospital, Mennonite Social Welfare Foundation, Fooyin University, Penghu Hospital, and Cishan Hospital.● Promoting Filial Piety: The Foundation promotes the spirit of filial piety in Eastern culture by spreading awareness to younger generations so as to alleviate social risks and issues related to aging societies. In 2022, the Foundation continued to work with the Filial Piety Resource Center of the K-12 major performing arts groups in Taiwan by sponsoring the production of Mozart’s Die Zauberflöte (The Magic Flute) at the National Taichung Theater and conducting and composing masterclasses at the National Symphony Orchestra (NSO) in hopes of bringing a fresh perspective to Taiwan’s arts environment during the pandemic and keeping the arts’ flame burning bright. 7.4 TSMC Charity FoundationUnder the guidance of Chairperson Sophie Chang, the TSMC Charity Foundation (the Foundation) strives to address social inequalities through volunteer onsite/online services. Established in 2017, the Foundation focuses on the four pillars of public welfare in its charitable programs and projects: care for the disadvantaged, taking care of the elderly, filial piety promotion, and protection of the environment. In 2022, the Foundation’s focus on assisting the disadvantaged honed in on rural empowerment as part of an initiative to correlate with social trends in rural education and employment integration. In rural areas, the Foundation offers various educational development resources to schools and after-schools. As for eldercare and care for the socioeconomically disadvantaged, the Foundation endeavors to improve their quality of life through both economic support and medical services. The Foundation continued to operate the “Sending Love” platform to strengthen the cooperation among enterprises, local governments and universities so as to strengthen local services and jointly uplift society.In 2022, the Foundation demonstrated its dedication to investing in public welfare and expanding projects to improve its scope of services:●Rural Empowerment: The Foundation continuously provides education and living assistance to institutes in need and to children in rural areas, including volunteer services, economic support, food supplies and the purchase of digital learning equipment and materials. In 2022, the Foundation focused on rural students’ employability. By collaborating with 104 JOB BANK on the “World of Jobs, Road to Employment” plan, the Foundation published 104 career exploring videos in 2022 to give rural students a broader outlook on future careers and encourage them to develop their potential. In helping rural students to obtain the skills to work locally, two enterprises, Chi Mei Frozen Food Co., Ltd. and Lohas Biotech Development Corp., joined this year to give training to two vocational high schools and extended job offers to 14 students. While the expanded plan of job placement was Education Administration, Ministry of Education to promote these concepts and cultural values. This included conducting ten filial piety parent-child workshops at elementary schools, where TSMC volunteers provide long-term care, as well as jointly producing short filial piety films and organizing award ceremonies to recognize excellence in teaching plans, thus encouraging both teachers and students to initiate intergenerational dialogue and to implant a modern spirit of filial piety within the hearts of all participants.●Protecting the Environment: The Foundation helped disadvantaged social welfare institutes to increase the use of green energy and save power, while also continuing to implement the “Cherish Food Program” to reduce resource waste. The “Green Energy for the Disadvantaged” project was launched in 2021, and by 2022 the Foundation had installed solar panels at six social welfare institutes, which can supplement these institutes’ operating expenses by selling green energy. The LED Lighting Replacement Program helped 240 schools to reduce electricity costs by at least 30% with energy-saving lights. As for the “Cherish Food Program”, the Foundation continued to work with many food companies to donate out-of-spec foods to 130 disadvantaged social welfare institutes to provide the children with after-school snacks, thereby reducing food waste. Current collaborators include Chi Mei Frozen Food Co., Ltd., Hunya Food Co., Ltd., Laurel Corporation, Lian-Hwa Foods Corp., Hsin Tung Yang Co., Ltd., Great Wall Group, and Lao Xie Zhen Co., Ltd.7.5 TSMC i-Charity The TSMC i-Charity platform, launched in 2014, is an interactive intranet site that employees use to propose charity projects, share project results, provide suggestions and responses, and conduct timely funding of activities to give back to society.In 2022, a total of 38,857 people donated more than NT$51.3 million to help repair earthquake-damaged houses in Hualien, to support the aboriginal elementary school’s baseball team, Junyi Academy, and to aid the Teach for Taiwan program and other fundraising projects.The TSMC i-Charity platform has accumulated more than NT$271 million in donations since its inception in 2014.

When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.  Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.  If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.  When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. The performance obligations are satisfied when customers obtain control of the promised goods, which is generally when the goods are delivered to the customers’ specified locations.  Revenue from sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. Estimated sales returns and other allowances is generally made and adjusted based on historical experience and the consideration of varying contractual terms to recognize refund liabilities, which is classified under accrued expenses and other current liabilities.  In principle, payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 30 days from the end of the month of when the invoice is issued. Due to the short term nature of the receivables from sale of goods with the immaterial discounted effect, the Company measures them at the original invoice amounts without discounting.  Employee Benefits  Short-term employee benefits  Liabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for service rendered by employees.  Retirement benefits  For defined contribution retirement benefit plans, payments to the benefit plan are recognized as an expense when the employees have rendered service entitling them to the contribution. For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing benefit is recognized based on actuarial calculations.   Defined benefit costs (including service cost, net interest and remeasurement) under the defined benefit retirement benefit plans are determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Service cost (including current service cost), and net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) are recognized as employee benefits expense in the period they occur. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which - 24 -   - 25 -  they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss.   Net defined benefit liability represents the actual deficit in the Company’s defined benefit plan.  Treasury Stock   Treasury stock represents the outstanding shares that the Company buys back from market, which is stated at cost and shown as a deduction in shareholders’ equity. When the Company retires treasury stock, the treasury stock account is reduced and the common stock as well as the capital surplus - additional paid-in capital are reversed on a pro rata basis. When the book value of the treasury stock exceeds the sum of the par value and additional paid-in capital, the difference is charged to capital surplus - treasury stock transactions and to retained earnings for any remaining amount.  Share-based payment arrangements  a. Equity-settled share-based payment arrangements  Restricted shares for employees are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the fair value at the grant date and the Company’s best estimate of the number expected to ultimately vest, with a corresponding increase in other equity - unearned employee benefits.  When restricted shares for employees are issued, other equity - unearned employee benefits is recognized on the grant date, with a corresponding increase in capital surplus - restricted shares for employees. Dividends paid to employees on restricted shares which do not need to be returned if employees resign in the vesting period are recognized as expenses upon the dividend declaration with a corresponding adjustment in retained earnings.  At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number of restricted shares for employees that are expected to vest. The impact from such revision is recognized in profit or loss so that the cumulative expenses reflect the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to capital surplus - restricted shares for employees.  b. Cash-settled share-based payment arrangements  For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognized for the services acquired, measured at the fair value of the liability incurred. At the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.  Taxation  Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.  Current tax  Income tax on unappropriated earnings (excluding earnings from foreign consolidated subsidiaries) is expensed in the year the shareholders approved the appropriation of earnings which is the year subsequent to the year the earnings are generated.  Adjustments of prior years’ tax liabilities are added to or deducted from the current year’s tax provision.    - 25 -   - 26 -  Deferred tax  Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits for research and development expenses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.  Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.  The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered. The deferred tax assets which originally not recognized is also reviewed at the end of each reporting period and recognized to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.  Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year in which the liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.  Current and deferred tax for the year  Current and deferred tax are recognized in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.  Government Grants  Government grants are not recognized until there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.  Government grants whose primary condition is that the Company should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire noncurrent assets (mainly including land use right and depreciable assets) are recognized as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related assets and recognized as a reduced depreciation or amortization charge in profit or loss over the contract period or useful lives of the related assets. Government grants that are receivables as compensation for expenses already incurred are deducted from incurred expenses in the period in which they become receivables.    5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION AND UNCERTAINTY  The Company has considered the economic implications of COVID-19 on critical accounting estimates and will continue evaluating the impact on its financial position and financial performance as a result of the pandemic.    - 26 -   - 27 -  In the application of the aforementioned Company’s accounting policies, the Company is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.  Critical Accounting Judgments  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue when the conditions described in Note 4 are satisfied.  Commencement of Depreciation Related to Property, Plant and Equipment Classified as Equipment under Installation and Construction in Progress (EUI/CIP)  As described in Note 4, commencement of depreciation related to EUI/CIP involves determining when the assets are available for their intended use. The criteria the Company uses to determine whether EUI/CIP are available for their intended use involves subjective judgments and assumptions about the conditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner.  Judgments on Lease Terms   In determining a lease term, the Company considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or not to exercise an option, including any expected changes in facts and circumstances from the commencement date until the exercise date of the option. Main factors considered include contractual terms and conditions covered by the optional periods, and the importance of the underlying asset to the lessee’s operations, etc. The lease term is reassessed if a significant change in circumstances that are within the control of the Company occurs.  Key Sources of Estimation and Uncertainty  Estimation of Sales Returns and Allowances  Sales returns and other allowance is estimated and recorded based on historical experience and in consideration of different contractual terms. The amount is deducted from revenue in the same period the related revenue is recorded. The Company periodically reviews the reasonableness of the estimates.  Valuation of Inventory  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the Company uses estimate to determine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of each reporting period.  The Company estimates the net realizable value of inventory for normal waste, obsolescence and unmarketable items at the end of reporting period and then writes down the cost of inventories to net realizable value. The net realizable value of the inventory is determined mainly based on assumptions of future demand within a specific time horizon.  Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets Other than Goodwill  In the process of evaluating the potential impairment of tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill, the Company determines the independent cash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue and expenses related to the specific asset groups with the consideration of the nature of - 27 -   - 28 -  semiconductor industry. Any change in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in significant impairment charges or reversal in future years.  Realization of Deferred Income Tax Assets  Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those deferred tax assets can be utilized. Assessment of the realization of the deferred tax assets requires subjective judgment and estimate, including the future revenue growth and profitability, tax holidays, the amount of tax credits can be utilized and feasible tax planning strategies. Any changes in the global economic environment, the industry trends and relevant laws and regulations could result in significant adjustments to the deferred tax assets.  Determination of Lessees’ Incremental Borrowing Rates  In determining a lessee’s incremental borrowing rate used in discounting lease payments, the Company mainly takes into account the market risk-free rates, the estimated lessee’s credit spreads and secured status in a similar economic environment.    6.

The hedge ratio is adjusted in response to the changes in the financial market and capped at 100%.  On the basis of economic relationships, the value of the interest rate futures contracts and the value of the hedged financial assets change in opposite directions in response to movements in interest rates.  The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is the credit risk of the hedged financial assets, which is not reflected in the fair value of the interest rate futures contracts. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships during the hedging period. Amount of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in profit or loss is classified under other gains and losses, net.   - 30 -   - 31 -  The following tables summarize the information relating to the hedges of interest rate risks.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS  a. Defined contribution plans  The plan under the R.O.C. Labor Pension Act (the “Act”) is deemed a defined contribution plan. Pursuant to the Act, TSMC and VisEra Tech have made monthly contributions equal to 6% of each employee’s monthly salary to employees’ pension accounts. Furthermore, TSMC North America, TSMC China, TSMC Nanjing, TSMC Arizona, TSMC Europe, TSMC Canada, TSMC Technology and JASM also make monthly contributions at certain percentages of the basic salary of their employees. Accordingly, the Company recognized expenses of NT$4,550,387 thousand and NT$3,711,010 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  b. Defined benefit plans  TSMC has defined benefit plans under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law that provide benefits based on an employee’s length of service and average monthly salary for the six-month period prior to retirement. The Company contributes an amount equal to 2% of salaries paid each month to their respective pension funds (the Funds), which are administered by the Labor Pension Fund Supervisory Committee (the Committee) and deposited in the Committee’s name in the Bank of Taiwan. Before the end of each year, the Company assesses the balance in the Funds. If the amount of the balance in the Funds is inadequate to pay retirement benefits for employees who conform to retirement requirements in the next year, the Company is required to fund the difference in one appropriation that should be made before the end of March of the next year. The Funds are operated and managed by the government’s designated authorities; as such, the Company does not have any right to intervene in the investments of the Funds.  Amounts recognized in respect of these defined benefit plans were as follows:    Years Ended December 31   2022  2021      Current service cost    $ 134,376    $ 145,289 Net interest expense     74,265     47,196 Components of defined benefit costs recognized in profit or loss     208,641     192,485 Remeasurement on the net defined benefit liability:     Return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest expense)     (429,948)     (73,298) Actuarial loss arising from experience adjustments     1,413,760     94,278 Actuarial loss arising from changes in demographic assumptions     -     277,454 Actuarial gain arising from changes in financial assumptions     (160,752)     (540,513) Components of defined benefit costs recognized in other comprehensive income     823,060     (242,079)      Total    $ 1,031,701    $ (49,594)    - 43 -   - 44 -  The pension costs of the aforementioned defined benefit plans were recognized in profit or loss by the following categories:    Years Ended December 31   2022  2021      Cost of revenue    $ 135,125    $ 124,548 Research and development expenses     55,632     52,801 General and administrative expenses     15,129     12,430 Marketing expenses     2,755     2,706              $ 208,641    $ 192,485  The amounts arising from the defined benefit obligation of the Company were as follows:    December 31, 2022  December 31, 2021      Present value of defined benefit obligation    $ 17,483,951    $ 16,585,442 Fair value of plan assets     (8,162,860)     (5,548,563)      Net defined benefit liability    $ 9,321,091    $ 11,036,879  Movements in the present value of the defined benefit obligation were as follows:    Years Ended December 31   2022  2021      Balance, beginning of year    $ 16,585,442    $ 16,980,277 Current service cost     134,376     145,289 Interest expense     120,791     66,664 Remeasurement:           Actuarial loss arising from experience adjustments     1,413,760     94,278 Actuarial loss arising from changes in demographic assumptions     -     277,454 Actuarial gain arising from changes in financial assumptions     (160,752)     (540,513) Benefits paid from plan assets      (585,343)     (431,817) Benefits paid directly by the Company     (24,323)     (6,190)      Balance, end of year    $ 17,483,951    $ 16,585,442  Movements in the fair value of the plan assets were as follows:    Years Ended December 31   2022  2021      Balance, beginning of year    $ 5,548,563    $ 5,066,203 Interest income     46,526     19,468 Remeasurement:     Return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest expense)     429,948     73,298 Contributions from employer     2,723,166     821,411 Benefits paid from plan assets     (585,343)     (431,817)      Balance, end of year    $ 8,162,860    $ 5,548,563  - 44 -   - 45 -  The fair value of the plan assets by major categories at the end of reporting period was as follows:    December 31, 2022  December 31, 2021      Cash    $ 1,337,893    $ 1,000,961 Equity instruments     4,696,909     2,951,835 Debt instruments     2,128,058     1,595,767              $ 8,162,860    $ 5,548,563  The actuarial valuations of the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out by qualified actuaries. The principal assumptions of the actuarial valuation were as follows:    Measurement Date   December 31, 2022  December 31, 2021      Discount rate  1.80%  0.75% Future salary increase rate  4.00%  3.00%  Through the defined benefit plans under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law, the Company is exposed to the following risks:  1) Investment risk: The pension funds are invested in equity and debt securities, bank deposits, etc. The investment is conducted at the discretion of the government’s designated authorities or under the mandated management. However, under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law, the rate of return on assets shall not be less than the average interest rate on a two-year time deposit published by the local banks and the government is responsible for any shortfall in the event that the rate of return is less than the required rate of return.  2) Interest risk: A decrease in the government bond interest rate will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the debt investments of the plan assets.  Assuming a hypothetical decrease in interest rate at the end of the reporting period contributed to a decrease of 0.5% (and not below 0.0%) in the discount rate and all other assumptions were held constant, the present value of the defined benefit obligation would increase by NT$766,692 thousand and NT$780,460 thousand as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  3) Salary risk: The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation.  Assuming the expected salary rate increases by 0.5% at the end of the reporting period and all other assumptions were held constant, the present value of the defined benefit obligation would increase by NT$746,933 thousand and NT$759,527 thousand as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.   Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability.  - 45 -   - 46 -  The Company expects to make contributions of NT$2,832,093 thousand to the defined benefit plans in the next year starting from December 31, 2022. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 9 years.   21. EQUITY  a.

As of the end of reporting period, 1,063,847 thousand ADSs of TSMC were traded on the NYSE. The number of common shares represented by the ADSs was 5,319,234 thousand shares (one ADS represents five common shares).  b. Capital surplus  The categories of uses and the sources of capital surplus based on regulations were as follows:    December 31, 2022  December 31, 2021      May be used to offset a deficit, distributed as cash dividends, or     transferred to share capital           Additional paid-in capital    $ 24,183,645    $ 24,184,939 From merger     22,803,291     22,804,510 From convertible bonds     8,892,371     8,892,847 From difference between the consideration received and the carrying amount of the subsidiaries’ net assets during actual disposal     8,406,282     8,406,282 Donations - donated by shareholders     11,275     11,275 (Continued)   - 46 -   - 47 -    December 31, 2022  December 31, 2021      May only be used to offset a deficit          From share of changes in equities of subsidiaries    $ 4,229,892    $ 113,952 From share of changes in equities of associates      311,863     307,322 Donations - unclaimed dividend     53,680     40,475      May not be used for any purpose          Employee restricted shares     438,029     -              $ 69,330,328    $ 64,761,602 (Concluded)  If such capital surplus is distributed as transferred to share capital, it is limited to a certain percentage of the Company’s paid-in capital each year.  c. Retained earnings and dividend policy  TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation provide that, earnings distribution may be made on a quarterly basis after the close of each quarter. Distribution of earnings by way of cash dividends should be approved by TSMC’s Board of Directors and reported to TSMC’s shareholders in its meeting. When allocating earnings, TSMC shall first estimate and reserve the taxes to be paid, offset its losses, set aside a legal capital reserve at 10% of the remaining earnings (until the accumulated legal capital reserve equals TSMC’s paid-in capital), then set aside a special capital reserve in accordance with relevant laws or regulations or as requested by the authorities in charge. Any balance left over shall be allocated according to relevant laws and TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation.  TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation also provide that profits of TSMC may be distributed by way of cash dividend and/or stock dividend. However, distribution of earnings shall be made preferably by way of cash dividend. Distribution of earnings may also be made by way of stock dividend, provided that the ratio for stock dividend shall not exceed 50% of the total distribution.  The legal capital reserve may be used to offset a deficit, or be distributed as dividends in cash or stocks for the portion in excess of 25% of the paid-in capital if the Company incurs no loss.
