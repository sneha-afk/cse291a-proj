In 2023, the gains from these investments amounted to NT$4,655,098 thousand on a consolidated basis, down from the previous year mainly due to decreases in product demand. In the future, TSMC’s long-term equity investments, accounted for using the equity method, will continue to focus on strategic purposes through prudent assessments.6.3 Risk Management6.3.1 Risk Management OverviewRisk Management Policy and FrameworkTSMC adopts a balanced risk-reward approach to risk management to optimize business returns while considering the holistic impact on corporate sustainability. TSMC’s risk management policy, approved by the Board of Directors and signed by the Chairman, affirms the commitment to proactive and robust risk management system in assisting TSMC in making well-considered, risk-based decisions that fulfill the corporate vision and deliver sustainable value to TSMC and its stakeholders.Adhering closely to the ISO 31000: 2018 Risk Management System and the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)’s Enterprise Risk Management – Integrated Framework, TSMC’s enterprise risk management (ERM) framework was established to provide a systematic approach to risk management. It outlines the risk governance structure, the management process that integrates business operations, and tools that facilitate the monitoring of risks, as well as a formalized training and communication program in building risk competency and fostering a risk-aware culture, to assist the management in making informed risk-based decisions while implementing business strategies. 企業風險管理架構業務策略：技術領先、卓越製造、客戶信任風險管理職能與溝通整合式風險管理IT系統* 包含風險管理指導委員會、風險管理執行委員會、風險管理工作小組、中央危機指揮中心與危機處理小組風險治理風險管理流程風險管理工具  風險管理政策與程序關鍵風險指標 / 風險登記冊董事會審計委員會管理團隊(註) 審   查監   控辨   識評   估回   應具風險意識的文化TSMC Enterprise Risk Management FrameworkCORPORATE STRATEGY | Technology Leadership, Manufacturing Excellence, Customer Partnership Risk Management Competency and CommunicationIntegrated Risk Managemet IT SystemRiskGovernanceRiskManagementProcessRisk Management ToolsKey Risk Indicator / Risk RegisterRisk-aware Culture* Comprising of Risk Management Steering Committee, Risk Management Executive Council, Risk Management Taskforces,   Central Crisis Command Centre & Crisis Management TeamRisk Management Policy and ProceduresBoard of Directors Audit and Risk CommitteeManagement (Note)ReviewIdentificationAssessmentResponseMonitorOperational RiskStrategic RiskFinancial RiskCompliance Risk營運風險策略風險財務風險合規風險Note: Includes the Risk Management Steering Committee, Risk Management Executive Council, Risk Management Taskforces, Central Crisis Command Center and Crisis Management Team●Enterprise Risk Management Framework134135Risk Appetite and Risk Management ScopeTSMC has defined its risk appetite in statements that outline the nature and extent of risks that TSMC is willing to take in pursuit of its business goals: ●Risk taken should be carefully evaluated, commensurate with rewards and be in line with the Company’s strategic, investment, financial and corporate objectives.●Risk considerations are an integral part of business operations and managed within the risk tolerance (risk indicators) of the divisions, of relevant functional units and of the Company itself.●The Company will not invest or participate in any business activities that exceed its risk tolerance. Specifically, the Company does not safety related breaches or lapses, non-compliance with laws and regulations, or illegal acts such as fraud, bribery and corruption.Following a five-step risk management process – identification, assessment, response, monitoring and review, risks assessments are performed by key functional units to form an enterprise-level risk map and mitigation plans, which are presented to the Audit and Risk Committee. This process is supported by ongoing education and awareness efforts in fostering a risk-aware culture and building risk competencies. TSMC recognizes that its systems and processes provide reasonable but not absolute assurance and hence continually strives to improve its ability to manage and respond to risks and opportunities that remain relevant and effective.●TSMC’s Key RisksStrategic RisksOperational Risks●Industry developments●Changes in technology ●Decrease in demand and average selling price●Competition●Investment and capacity expansion●Natural and man-made disasters●Project management, construction of new fabs●Sales concentration●Purchasing concentration●Intellectual property rights●Mergers and acquisitions●IT security●Recruiting quality personnel●Future R&D plans and expected R&D spending●Change in corporate reputation and impact on the Company’s crisis management●Change in managementFinancial Risks●Economic risks including interest rate fluctuation, foreign exchange volatility, inflation, and amendments to tax regulations or implementation of new tax laws●External financing●High-risk or highly leveraged investments; lending, endorsements, and guarantees for other parties; and financial derivative transactions●Impairment charges Compliance Risks●Changes in the government policies and regulatory environment●Litigation and non-litigation matters●Non-compliance with export control, environmental and climate change related laws, regulations and accords, and failure to timely obtain requisite approvals necessary for conducting businessRisk Management Governance StructureRisk management at TSMC involves both the Board of Directors and management in an effort to embed sound risk management practices in business decisions and operations across the Company. The Board of Directors is responsible for the governance of risk and has authorized the Audit and Risk Committee to review TSMC’s ERM framework. At the managerial level, risk management governance structure includes Risk Management Steering Committee, Risk Management Executive Council, taskforces and the risk management division. Assisting the Audit and Risk Committee in establishing and overseeing a proactive and effective risk management system, the risk management division works with each function and fab in applying the ERM framework to assess and mitigate risks throughout TSMC by monitoring, implementing risk related policies and guidelines, as well as taking initiatives to support the implementation of ERM framework. Every six months, the risk management division reports to the Audit and Risk Committee on TSMC’s key risks and mitigation efforts. The Audit and Risk Committee’s chairperson then reports to the Board of Directors on the current risk profile and risk mitigation measures being taken.Risk management is a responsibility shared by both management and employees. All employees are required to be competent and accountable for managing risks related to their area of responsibility with clear risk ownership. TSMC Risk Management Academy is set up with the aim to equip and raise risk competencies for all levels of employees, including Board of Directors and management in support of an effective risk-aware culture embedding risk management as part of performance appraisal process promotes risk accountability and ownership. The roles and responsibilities of the risk management governance structure are defined as below:Risk Management Steering Committee●Advises the Board in determining overall risk appetite, tolerance, strategy and resource allocation, taking into account current and prospective macroeconomic, technological, regulatory, environmental and social developments and trends.●Reviews and oversees the applicability and performances of the risk management framework, policy and procedures.●Provides advice and assurance to the Board by adopting a holistic view of the key risks that TSMC is exposed to and approves the prioritization of risk mitigations.●Sets the tone toward risk management from the top, provides sponsorship to initiatives and activities to nurture the desired risk culture, awareness and capabilities of effectively and sufficiently managing key risks and new type of risks, including clarifying risk ownership.●Ensures that risk management is incorporated into strategic business development and operational planning, day-to-day management and decision making.● Advises the Board on proposed transactions to address strategic risks and capitalize on opportunities. Risk Management Executive Council ●Identifies potential and emerging risks that may impact TSMC in achieving its objectives and/or the continued effectiveness and efficiency of its business operations.●Conducts risk assessments, defines mitigation plans, including incident management plans, provides sponsorship and allocates sufficient resources to enable timely and effective mitigation. ●Leads and drives cross-functional taskforces, meetings or other activities to ensure that risks are adequately and effectively mitigated, including collaboration with risk management division and various other parties.●Defines key risk indicators (KRIs) to proactively monitor risk dynamics and respond in a timely and effective manner.●Builds a risk-aware culture and raises risk competency in fabs and divisions, including but not limited to training, exercises and continuous improvements.●Defines and facilitates action plans based on root cause analysis to prevent reoccurrences of major incidents, high-risk events and major findings raised from internal and external reviews.●Reports to the risk management steering committee on the progress, effectiveness, and lessons learned, and implements the decisions made by the committee.Risk Management Taskforce●Identifies and assesses potential risks and threats that may prevent TSMC from achieving its business objectives and deploys appropriate mitigation measures.●Plans and executes risk prevention and mitigation in accordance with various scenarios.●Organizes and/or participates in cross-functional meetings, in addressing risks that span multiple disciplines or divisions/fabs.●Participates in the implementation and execution of risk management initiatives and activities.●Reviews the investigation of major incidents, high-risk events and major findings raised from internal and external checks for division.

The Company is cognizant of the major risks of natural and man-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, sandstorms, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, fire, gas/chemical leakage, pandemic, cyberattacks, supply chain disruption, geopolitical tension, sabotage, failure of critical facilities and equipment, and shortages in the supply of utilities, such as water, electricity and natural gas that could disrupt operations.To mitigate the operational impact of crisis events, the risk management division implements pre-crisis risk assessment, response procedures and recovery plans. Exercises and drills are also conducted to validate emergency responses, crisis management, business continuity plans to enhance operational preparedness. In major incidents or crisis events, the crisis management guidelines are followed. The Central Crisis Command Centre (C4), headed by the CEO and comprised of senior executives across key functions, provides guidance and decision-making to ensure a constant readiness-to-respond capability, including timely responses and communication to key stakeholders.6.3.2 Strategic RisksRisks Associated with Changes in Technology and Industry●Industry Developments The electronics industries and semiconductor market are cyclical and subject to significant and often rapid fluctuations in product demand, which could impact TSMC’s semiconductor foundry business. Variations in customer order levels may result in volatility in the Company’s revenue and earnings.From time to time, the electronics and semiconductor industries have experienced significant and occasionally prolonged periods of downturns and overcapacity. Because TSMC is, and will continue to be, dependent on the demand of electronics and semiconductor companies for its services, periods of downturns and overcapacity in the general electronics and semiconductor industries could lead to reduced demand for overall semiconductor foundry services, including TSMC’s services. If TSMC is not able take appropriate actions, such as reducing its costs to sufficiently offset declines in demand, the Company’s revenue, margins and earnings will likely suffer during periods of downturns and overcapacity.●Changes in TechnologyThe semiconductor industry and its technologies are constantly changing. TSMC competes by developing process technologies using increasingly advanced nodes and manufacturing products with more functions. The Company also competes by developing new derivative technologies. If TSMC does not anticipate these changes in technologies and rapidly develop new and innovative technologies, or if the Company’s competitors unforeseeably gain sudden access to additional technologies, TSMC may not be able to provide foundry services on competitive terms. For example, the global surge in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) has had a significant impact on customer demand for advanced semiconductor chips and the market dynamics in TSMC’s industry; thus, TSMC’s ability to continuously develop relevant technologies, products and services to meet these customer needs will be critical for the Company to effectively compete in this space. TSMC also believes that the effective use of AI in its internal operations is important to its long-term success. As the AI technologies are rapidly evolving, if TSMC is unable to deploy new AI technologies in its internal operations as effectively as its competitors, it may hurt the Company’s competitive position. In addition, TSMC’s customers have significantly decreased the time in which their products or services are launched into the market. If TSMC is unable to meet these shorter product time-to-market, it risks losing these customers. These factors have also been intensified by the shift of the global technology market to consumer driven products, such as smartphones, and increasing competition and concentration of customers (all further discussed among these risk factors).Also, the uncertainty and instability inherent in advanced technologies impose challenges for achieving expected product quality and product yield. If TSMC fails to maintain quality, it may result in loss of revenue and additional cost, as well as loss of business or customer trust. If TSMC is unable to overcome the above factors, it may become less competitive and its revenue may decline significantly. Regarding the response measures for the above-mentioned risks, please refer to “2.2.4 TSMC Position, Differentiation and Strategy” on page 19-21 of this Annual Report. ●IT SecurityEven though TSMC has established a comprehensive internet and computing security network, the Company cannot guarantee that its computing systems which control or maintain vital corporate functions, such as manufacturing operations and enterprise accounting, would be completely immune to crippling cyberattacks. In the event of a serious cyberattack, TSMC’s systems may lose important corporate data or its production lines may be shut down pending the resolution of such attack. Major cyberattacks could also lead to loss or divulgence of trade secrets and other sensitive information, such as proprietary information of its customers and other stakeholders and personal information of its employees. While TSMC seeks to continuously review and assess its cybersecurity policies and procedures to ensure their adequacy and effectiveness, it can’t guarantee that it will not be susceptible to new and emerging risks and attacks in the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats. For example, as AI continues to evolve, cyber-attackers could also use AI to develop malicious codes and sophisticated phishing attempts.Malicious hackers may also try to introduce computer viruses, corrupted software or ransomware into TSMC’s network systems to disrupt its operations, blackmail the Company to regain control of its computing systems, or spy on it for sensitive information. These attacks may result in TSMC having to pay damages for its delayed or disrupted orders or incur significant expenses in implementing remedial and improvement measures to further enhance its cybersecurity network, and may also expose the Company to significant legal liabilities arising from or related to legal proceedings or regulatory investigations associated with such breaches.TSMC has experienced in the past, and may in the future be subject to attacks by malicious software. TSMC has implemented and continually updated rigorous cybersecurity measures to prevent and minimize harm caused by such attacks. Such measures include establishing advanced portable virus scanning tools and new fab tool virus scanning including internal computer scanning to protect fab equipment, strengthening GIGAFAB® network architecture and network controls to prevent computer viruses from spreading among tools and fabs, installing advanced malware defense solutions for critical computers, building a defense shield in the Cloud, including new Cloud solution architecture to secure internet access, and enhancing Cloud solutions and public website security policy and framework, adopting advanced solutions against distributed denial-of-service attacks, introducing new technology for data protection, enhancing and certifying office computer security compliance, improving email phishing defense and implementing employee awareness testing. TSMC also established an integrated and automatic security operation platform, enabled the automation of cybersecurity event detection and response, enhanced internal security assessment automation, conducted external red team testing and practiced responses to ransomware attacks. For supply chain risk reduction, through collaboration, TSMC helps major suppliers improve their security, shares best practices at industry security events, and conducts supplier security onsite audits. Moreover, TSMC has collaborated with the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Institute (SEMI) to set up a Semiconductor Cybersecurity Committee to promote security standards (SEMI E187) as well as security assessment methodology for improving the resilience of the semiconductor supply chain, an action that was recognized by a 2023 SEMI International 138139Standards award. While these ongoing enhancements further improve Company’s cybersecurity defense solutions, there can be no assurance that the Company is immune to cyberattacks.In addition, TSMC employs certain third-party service providers for itself and its affiliates worldwide with whom it needs to share highly sensitive and confidential information to enable them to provide the relevant services. While TSMC requires such third-party service providers to strictly fulfill the confidentiality and/or internet security requirements in its service agreements with them, there is no assurance that each of them will comply with such obligations. Moreover, such third-party service providers may also be susceptible to cyberattacks. If TSMC or its service providers are not able to timely resolve the respective technical difficulties caused by such cyberattacks, or ensure the integrity and availability of its data (and data belonging to its customers and other third parties) or maintain control of its or its service providers’ computing systems, the Company’s commitments to its customers and other stakeholders may be materially impaired and its results of operations, financial condition, prospects and reputation may also be materially and adversely affected.Risks Associated with Decrease in Demand and Average Selling PriceA vast majority of the Company’s revenue is derived from customers who use TSMC’s products in high performance computing (“HPC”), smartphones, IoT, automotive, and digital consumer electronics. Any deterioration in or a slowdown in the growth of such end markets resulting in a substantial decrease in the demand for overall global semiconductor foundry services, including TSMC’s products and services, could adversely affect the Company’s revenue. Further, semiconductor manufacturing facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed cost assets once they are in operation. Because the Company owns most of its manufacturing capacities, a significant portion of its operating costs is fixed. In general, these costs do not decline when customer demand or TSMC’s capacity utilization rates drop, and thus declines in customer demand, among other factors, may significantly decrease TSMC’s margins. Conversely, as product demand rises and factory utilization increases, the fixed costs are spread over increased output, which can improve TSMC’s margins. In addition, the historical trend of declining average selling prices (“ASP”) of end-use applications places downward pressure on the prices of the components that go into such applications. Decreases in the ASP of end use applications may increase pricing pressure on components produced by us, which, in turn, may negatively impact the Company’s revenue, margin and earnings.Risks Associated with CompetitionThe competition in the semiconductor foundry industry is fierce. The Company competes with other foundry service providers, as well as a number of integrated device manufacturers. Some of these companies may have access to more advanced or different technologies than TSMC. Other companies may have greater financial and other resources than TSMC, such as the possibility of receiving direct or indirect government subsidies, economic stimulus funds, or other incentives that may be unavailable to TSMC. The governments of the United States, China, Europe, South Korea and Japan provide various incentive programs to promote developments of their domestic semiconductor industries, such as the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors and Science Act of 2022 (the “U.S. CHIPS Act”), which provides financial incentives to incentivize the development of U.S. semiconductor industry. Although governments in certain of the countries or regions where TSMC is currently expanding or planning to expand its production capacity have extended or may in the future extend certain financial incentives to the Company, there is no assurance that TSMC will be able to receive such financial incentives at the levels TSMC anticipates or at all. Additionally, any financial incentives the Company receives may be subject to conditions imposed by the grantors, such as restrictions on the expansion of facilities in foreign countries of concern and on joint research and technology licensing efforts with foreign entities of concern on any technology or product that raises national security concerns, or the grantors could seek to recover any funds provided to TSMC, or cancel, reduce or deny TSMC’s requested subsidies or grants in the future. This could materially increase TSMC’s costs or otherwise adversely affect its operations.Moreover, the Company’s competitors may, from time to time, also decide to undertake aggressive pricing initiatives in one or several technology nodes. The Company’s competitors may also compete for its customers who seek to diversify their supply chains. These competitive activities may decrease TSMC’s customer base, TSMC’s pricing, or both. If TSMC is unable to compete effectively with such competitors on technology, manufacturing capacity, product quality, supply chain diversification and resilience, and customer satisfaction, it risks losing customers or business to such contenders.Risks Associated with Changes in the Government Policies and Regulatory EnvironmentTSMC management closely monitors all domestic and foreign governmental policies and regulations that might impact TSMC’s business and financial operations. During 2023 and as of the date of this Annual Report, the following changes or developments in governmental policies and regulations may influence the Company’s business operations:The manufacturing, assembling and testing of TSMC’s products require the use of chemicals and materials that are subject to environmental, climate related, health and safety laws and regulations issued worldwide as well as international accords such as the Paris Agreement. Climate change related laws or regulations currently are too indefinite for the Company to assess the impact on our future financial condition with any degree of reasonable certainty. For example, the Taiwan “Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act”, which became effective on July 1, 2015, was amended and was renamed as “Climate Change Response Act”. The amendments became effective in February 2023, which set a goal of reaching net-zero emissions in Taiwan by 2050 and also established a carbon fee system to collect carbon fees on direct and indirect emissions from emitters whose emissions reach certain thresholds. The government will start collecting carbon fees from 2025 but the rate for such fees has yet to be determined by the relevant authorities. We could be required to pay any incurred carbon fees since our emission levels exceed applicable thresholds pursuant to the current regulatory requirements, which will result in increased operating costs for us and affect us financially to a certain extent. We expect to see more of its relevant regulations promulgated by the regulators in the future. Also, the R.O.C. legislative authority is reviewing, at all times, various environmental issues to develop laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and climate related changes. The impact of such laws and regulations, as well as of the carbon fee, is indeterminable at the moment. It is not expected that other governmental policies or regulatory changes would materially impact TSMC’s operations or financial condition.6.3.3 Operational RisksNatural and Man-Made DisasterTSMC is committed to maintaining operational resilience in accordance with business continuity management standards that equips it with the capability to respond effectively to business disruption. Disruptions caused by natural and man-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, sandstorms, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, fire, gas/chemical leakage, pandemic, supply chain disruption, geopolitical tensions, cyberattacks, sabotage, failure of critical facilities and equipment, shortages in the supply of utilities, such as water, electricity and natural gas, etc., could interrupt TSMC’s operations.Most of TSMC’s production facilities, as well as those of many of its suppliers, customers and upstream providers of complementary semiconductor manufacturing services, are located in areas susceptible to natural disasters and may face potential shortages of electricity and/or water, which could cause interruptions to TSMC’s operations.Thus, if one or more natural disasters result in a prolonged disruption to TSMC’s operations or those of its customers or suppliers, or if any of its fabs or vendor facilities were to be damaged or cease operations as a result of an unforeseen disruptive event, it could reduce TSMC’s manufacturing capacity and cause the loss of important customers and thereby have an adverse, material impact on its operational and financial performance.To cope with possible droughts resulted from severe climate change, TSMC implemented manufacturing process water saving, as well as building up industrial water recycling plants, using household water and cooperating with government to mitigate water shortage risk. As part of TSMC’s business continuity plans, measures taken include water conservation measures, use of alternative water sources. Close monitoring of water situation including stress testing and exercises are carried out to validate our response plan.TSMC has occasionally suffered power outages, dips or surges caused by difficulties encountered by its electricity supplier or other power consumers on the same power grid. Some of these incidents have resulted in interruptions to TSMC’s operations. Such outages, shortages or interruptions in electricity supply could further be exacerbated by changes in the energy policy of the governments. If TSMC is unable to secure reliable and uninterrupted supply of electricity to power its manufacturing fabs, its ability to fill customers’ orders would be jeopardized. Moreover, TSMC has encountered and may continue to encounter increases in the prices of utilities. For example, effective from April 1, 2024, TSMC is subject to a higher electricity tariff rate in Taiwan, which is estimated to increase by 25%, as compared to the tariff rate applicable to 140141the Company in 2023. The increased prices for electricity could increase TSMC’s manufacturing costs and therefore adversely impact TSMC’s financial results.If such events were to occur over prolonged periods of time, TSMC’s operations and financial performance may be materially adversely affected. Moreover, TSMC’s future capacity expansions in Taiwan and elsewhere could be curtailed by utility shortages.TSMC has further strengthened its business continuity management, which includes periodic risk assessments and mitigations, and the establishment of taskforces before emergency events. The taskforces define emergency response, crisis communication, recovery plans and preventative measures based on the thorough analysis of derivative effects and alternative solutions to ensure the impacts of people injury, business interruption, finance are minimized. TSMC reviews periodically its business continuity plans and refines them to reflect exercise results and implementation. In response to the impact of the earthquakes that occurs in Taiwan, TSMC continues to improve its earthquake emergency response, tool anchorage and seismic isolation facilities, and readiness for tool salvage and production recovery. These improvements have been integrated into new fab design. TSMC’s business continuity procedures were further enhanced through close reference to ISO 22301 business continuity management system (BCMS).TSMC maintains a comprehensive risk management system dedicated to human safety, the conservation of natural resources and the protection of property. In order to cope effectively with emergencies and natural disasters, management at each facility has developed comprehensive plans and procedures that focus on risk prevention, emergency response, crisis management and business continuity. All TSMC manufacturing fabs have been ISO 14001 certified (environmental management) and ISO 45001 certified (occupational health and safety management). All manufacturing fabs in Taiwan have also been TOSHMS (Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System) certified. New fabs will also attain the above certifications within 18 months after acquiring factory registration certification.TSMC and many of its suppliers use flammable and toxic materials in their manufacturing processes and are therefore subject to risks that cannot be completely eliminated arising from explosion, fire, or environmental influences. Although TSMC maintains multiple layers of risk prevention and protection, as well as fire and casualty insurance, TSMC’s risk management and insurance coverage may not always be sufficient to cover all of its potential losses. If any of TSMC’s fabs or vendor facilities were to be damaged or cease operations as a result of an explosion, fire or environmental causes, it could reduce the TSMC’s manufacturing capacity leading to the loss of important sales and customers and have a negative impact on TSMC’s financial performance. In addition to periodic fire-protection inspections and firefighting drills, TSMC has also carried out a corporate-wide fire risk mitigation project focused on managerial and hardware improvements.TSMC continues to monitor key disruptive threats to its business operations and adapt the plans to ensure operational resilience.Risks Associated with Capacity ExpansionTSMC performs long-term market demand forecasts for its products and services to manage its overall capacity. Based on its market demand forecasts, the Company has continued to add capacity to meet market needs for its products and services, including in Taiwan, in Arizona, U.S., in Nanjing, China, in Kumamoto, Japan and in Dresden, Germany.Implementing these capacity expansion plans will increase its costs, and the increases may be substantial. For example, the Company would need to build new facilities, purchase additional equipment and hire and train personnel to operate the new equipment. If TSMC does not increase its net revenue accordingly, its financial performance may be adversely affected by these increased costs.In addition, market conditions are dynamic and TSMC’s market demand forecasts may change significantly at any time. During periods of decreased demand, certain manufacturing lines or tools in some of the Company’s manufacturing facilities may be suspended or shut down temporarily. However, if demand subsequently increases rapidly over a short period of time, TSMC may not be able to restore the capacity in a timely manner to take advantage of the upturn. In such circumstances, its financial performance and competitiveness may be adversely affected.In order to mitigate the risk associated with capacity expansion, TSMC continuously watches for changes in market conditions and works closely with its customers. When market demand is not as expected, the Company tries to adjust its capacity plans in a timely manner to reduce the impact on its financial performance.Risks Associated with Construction of New FabsThe Company has multiple expansion projects that are currently underway, including the design and construction of new fabs worldwide. Global expansion has required and will continue to require considerable managerial, financial and other resources. The Company expects to face particular challenges in global expansion and operations, including but not limited to:●higher costs associated with construction of new fabs, establishing supply chains for various materials in different overseas locations, the impact on the Company’s ability to sustain its current level of productivity and manufacturing efficiency provided by its ecosystem of interconnected semiconductor fabs, employees and suppliers in the R.O.C., and recruiting and retaining talent in various overseas locations;●labor shortages, interruptions in the supply chains for various materials, and construction issues, which could substantially delay the completion of the Company’s expansion projects, and could further result in substantial additional costs or failure to meet its capacity expansion plans; ●disruptions to the Company’s operations caused by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, flooding, typhoons, droughts, tsunamis, sandstorms, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, fire, gas/chemical leakage, pandemic, supply chain disruption, geopolitical tensions, sabotage, failure of critical facilities and equipment and shortages in the supply of utilities, such as water, electricity, and natural gas, etc.;●scarcity of industrial-use land, which could limit the Company’s future expansion of operations;●compliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations, and the risk of penalties if the Company’s practices are deemed not to be in compliance;●challenges in managing information technology infrastructure in multiple locations and across different systems and risks of our information technology infrastructure succumbing to cyberattacks by third parties worldwide;●adverse changes relating to government grants or other government incentives;●challenges in creating an inclusive workplace in new sites to embrace the cultural differences and managing the operation over large geographic distances; ●limited or insufficient intellectual property protection or difficulties enforcing the Company’s rights to intellectual property; and●exposure to different tax jurisdictions and potential adverse tax consequences.If TSMC is unable to overcome the above challenges, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Risks Associated with Sales ConcentrationOver the years, the Company’s customer profile and the nature of the Company’s customers’ business have changed dramatically. While TSMC generates revenue from hundreds of customers worldwide, TSMC’s ten largest customers in 2021, 2022 and 2023 accounted for approximately, 71%, 68% and 70% of TSMC’s net revenue in the respective year. TSMC’s largest customer in 2021, 2022 and 2023 accounted for 26%, 23% and 25% of the Company’s net revenue in the respective year. TSMC’s second largest customer in 2021, 2022 and 2023 accounted for 10%, less than 10% and 11% of TSMC’s net revenue in the respective year.A more concentrated customer base will subject TSMC’s revenue to seasonal demand fluctuations from the Company’s large customers, and cause different seasonal patterns in the Company’s business. This customer concentration results in part from the changing dynamics of the electronics industry with the structural shift to mobile and high performance computing (HPC) devices and applications and software that provide the content for such devices.  There are only a limited number of customers who are successfully exploiting this new business model paradigm. Also, TSMC has seen changes in the nature of its customers’ business models in response to this new business model paradigm. For example, there is a growing trend among system companies designing their own semiconductors and working directly with the semiconductor foundries, which makes their products and services more marketable in a changing consumer market.Also, since the global semiconductor industry has become increasingly competitive, some of TSMC’s customers have engaged in industry consolidations in order to remain competitive. Such consolidations have taken the form of mergers and acquisitions. If more of TSMC’s major customers consolidate, this will further decrease the overall number of the Company’s customer pool. In addition, regulatory restrictions, such as export controls directed at TSMC’s major customers, could impact the Company’s ability to supply products to those customers or reduce those customers’ demand for TSMC’s products and services and thus impact their business operations.The loss of, or significant curtailment of purchases by, one or more of the Company’s top customers including curtailments 142143due to increased competitive pressures, industry consolidation, changes in applicable regulatory restrictions, product designs, manufacturing sourcing or outsourcing policies or practices of these customers, the timing of customer inventory adjustments, or changes in its major customers’ business models, may adversely affect TSMC’s results of operations and financial condition.Risks Associated with Purchasing Concentration●Raw MaterialsTSMC’s production operations require that it obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, such as silicon wafers, gases, chemicals and photoresist, on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices. In the past, shortages in the supply of some materials, whether by specific suppliers or by the semiconductor industry generally, have resulted in occasional industry-wide price adjustments and delivery delays. Moreover, major natural disasters, trade barriers and political or economic turmoil, including military conflicts and inflation, occurring within the country of origin of such raw materials may also significantly disrupt the availability of such raw materials or increase their prices. Also, since TSMC procures some of its raw materials from sole-sourced suppliers, there is a risk that the Company’s needs for such raw materials may not be met or that back-up supplies may not be readily available. Importation and domestic production limitations may also limit the Company’s ability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials as well as materials of the necessary quality. In addition, recent trade tensions could result in increased prices or even unavailability of raw materials due to tariffs, export control or other non-tariff barriers. TSMC’s revenue and earnings could decline if it is unable to obtain adequate supplies of the necessary raw materials in a timely manner or if there are significant increases in the costs of raw materials. To reduce the supply chain risk and to manage costs effectively, TSMC commits resources toward developing new supply sources and developing a future capacity plan with qualified raw material suppliers. Furthermore, the Company continually encourages its suppliers to reduce their supply chain risk by decentralizing production plants to improve their cost competitiveness and to support TSMC global demands in a timely fashion.TSMC not only operates world-class manufacturing process and facilities but needs sufficient world-class high-quality raw materials. As a result, TSMC engages early and extensively with primary suppliers on managing quality and capacity issues so as to be prepared for any unexpected need to ramp up or curtail production. To streamline supply chain risk, the Company communicates early on with major material suppliers regarding quality and capacity topics and has formed a dedicated team for supplier plant onsite or remote audits to extend supply chain best practices to its upstream suppliers. In addition, in response to the rapid increase or decrease in production capacity of new products, TSMC has continued to improve its inventory monitoring system to achieve more accurate demand forecasts and ensure that the supply chain maintains sufficient inventory levels. The Company also performs supply chain risk assessments to ensure that critical suppliers meet various standards in labor, ethics, environmental, safety and health (ESH) practices and business continuity plans (BCPs).●EquipmentThe Company’s operations and ongoing expansion plans depend on its ability to obtain necessary equipment and related services available from a limited number of suppliers. As a result, TSMC may encounter the situation of limited supply and/or long delivery cycles. To better manage its supply chain, the Company evaluates and projects delivery lead times to minimize the impact of supply chain risks on operating costs. TSMC has also implemented various collaborative business models and risk management contingencies with suppliers to ensure supply and shorten the procurement lead time. To enhance its sourcing capabilities for its global sites, the company has also taken steps to strengthen its understanding of local regulations, policies, and supply chains. However, if TSMC is unable to acquire in a timely manner the equipment and parts it needs, it may fail to successfully implement capacity expansion plans and exploit time sensitive business opportunities. Additionally, ongoing trade tensions could result in increased prices for, or even unavailability of, key equipment, through delay or denial of necessary export licenses, adoption of additional export control measures and other tariff or non-tariff barriers. If TSMC is unable to obtain equipment in a timely fashion to fulfill its customers’ demand for technology and production capacity, or unable to do so at a reasonable cost, its financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.Risks Associated with Intellectual Property RightsThe Company’s ability to compete successfully and to achieve future growth depends in part on the continued strength of its intellectual property portfolio. While the Company actively enforces and protects our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that its efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of its proprietary technologies, software, trade secrets or know-how. Also, the Company cannot assure you that, as its business or business models expand into new areas, it will be able to develop independently the technologies, patents, software, trade secrets or know-how necessary to conduct its business or that it can do so without unknowingly infringing the intellectual property rights of others. As a result, the Company may have to rely on, to a certain degree, licensed technologies and patent licenses from others. To the extent that the Company relies on licenses from others, there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain any or all of the necessary licenses in the future on terms it considers reasonable or at all. The lack of necessary licenses could expose the Company to claims for damages and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by its customers in instances where it has contractually agreed to indemnify its customers against damages resulting from infringement claims.The Company has received, from time to time, communications from third parties, including non-practicing entities and semiconductor companies, asserting that TSMC’s technologies, its manufacturing processes, or the design IPs of the semiconductors made by TSMC or the use of those semiconductors by its customers may infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. Because of the nature of the industry, its market position, and the expansion of its manufacturing operations outside of Taiwan, the Company may receive an increased number of such communications in the future. The assertions made and lawsuits initiated by litigious, well-funded, non-practicing entities are particularly aggressive in their monetary demand and in seeking court-issued injunctions. Such lawsuits and assertions may increase TSMC’s cost of doing business and may potentially be extremely disruptive if these asserting entities succeed in blocking the trade of products made and services offered by TSMC. Also, with the expansion of its manufacturing operations into certain non-R.O.C jurisdictions, it has faced increased challenges in managing risks of intellectual property misappropriation. Despite our efforts to adopt robust measures to mitigate the risk of intellectual property misappropriation in such new jurisdictions, we cannot guarantee that the protection measures we adopted will be sufficient to prevent us from potential infringements by others, or at all.If the Company fails to obtain or maintain certain technologies or intellectual property licenses or fails to prevent our intellectual property from being misappropriated and, if litigation relating to alleged intellectual property matters occurs, it could: (1) prevent the Company from manufacturing particular products or selling particular services or applying particular technologies; and (2) reduce our ability to compete effectively against entities benefiting from our misappropriated intellectual property, which could reduce its opportunities to generate revenue.The Company has taken related measures to minimize potential loss of shareholder value arising from intellectual property claims and litigation filed against it. These measures include: strategically obtaining licenses from certain semiconductor and other technology companies as needed; timely securing intellectual property rights originating within and outside of TSMC for defensive and/or offensive protection of TSMC technology and business; and aggressively defending against baseless litigation.Risks Associated with Litigious and Non-litigious MattersAs is the case with many companies in the semiconductor industry, the Company has received from time to time communications from third parties asserting that its technologies, its manufacturing processes, or the design of the semiconductors made by TSMC or the use of those semiconductors by its customers may infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights. These assertions have at times resulted in litigation by or against the Company and settlement payments by the Company. Irrespective of the validity of these claims, the Company could incur significant costs in the defense thereof or could suffer adverse effects on its operations. The Company is also subject to antitrust compliance requirements and scrutiny by governmental regulators in multiple jurisdictions. Any adverse results of such proceeding or other similar proceedings that may arise in those jurisdictions could harm TSMC’s business and distract its management, and thereby have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or prospects, and subject the Company to potential significant legal liability.Currently, TSMC’s material legal proceeding is as follows:In September 2022, Daedalus Prime LLC (“Daedalus”) filed complaints in the U.S. International Trade Commission (“ITC”) and the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that TSMC, TSMC North America, and other companies infringe four U.S. patents. The ITC instituted an investigation in October 2022. In June 2023, Daedalus dropped two of the asserted patents in the ITC. Also in June 2023, Daedalus filed another complaint in the Eastern District 144145of Texas alleging that TSMC infringes five U.S. patents. In September 2023, the ITC granted the parties’ joint motion to suspend the procedural schedule while the parties finalize the settlement agreement and then request termination of the ITC Investigation and related litigations. In October 2023, the parties jointly requested the ITC to terminate the investigation and Eastern District of Texas to dismiss the related litigations. In November 2023, the ITC investigation was terminated and the related litigations in the Eastern District of Texas were dismissed.Other than the matter described above, as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC is not currently a party to any other material legal proceedings.Risks Associated with Mergers and AcquisitionsIn 2023 and as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC had not conducted any merger or acquisition.Risks Associated with Recruiting Quality PersonnelTSMC relies on the continued services and contributions of its management team, as well as skilled technical and professional personnel. The Company’s business could suffer from the inability to fulfill personnel needs with high quality professionals in a timely fashion caused by the loss of personnel, talent shortages, illegal talent poaching, immigration controls, or related changes in market demand for our products and services. Since there is fierce competition for talent recruitment, the Company cannot ensure timely fulfillment of its personnel demand.In order to reduce the risk of talent recruitment, TSMC encourages job rotation and employs an on-the-job training and certification system. In this way, employees can continuously learn and enhance their work efficiency and effectiveness in the workplace. Moreover, TSMC creates multiple recruitment channels and continues to hire diverse top-notch, talented professionals from Taiwan and overseas. At the same time, the Company continues to expand industry-academic cooperation to meet outstanding talent at an early phase to recruit them in the future.Future R&D Plans and Expected R&D SpendingFor additional details, see “5.2.7 Future R&D Plans” on page 104-105 of this Annual Report.Changes in Corporate Reputation and Impact on the Company’s Crisis ManagementTSMC has established an excellent reputation worldwide based on its core values of integrity, commitment, innovation and customer trust. The Company’s positive image also reflects outstanding operations, rigorous corporate governance and dedication to sustainable responsibility by serving as a good corporate citizen. TSMC continues to pursue innovation in economic, environmental and social dimensions.In 2023, TSMC was honored with numerous awards and citations for achievements in various areas including operations, corporate governance, patents, profit growth, investor relations, environmental protection, and corporate sustainability. The Company was selected as a part of the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the 23rd consecutive year. TSMC won first place in CommonWealth magazine’s inaugural Talent Sustainability award and in the Taiwan Institute for Sustainable Energy’s Corporate Sustainability award for 2023. The Company was recognized as a Taiwan Top Ten Sustainability Exemplary in the Corporate Sustainability report, and for Climate Leadership, Circular Economy Leadership, Supply Chain Management, Sustainable Water Management and Information Security Leadership. The Carbon Disclosure Project chose TSMC as a Supplier Engagement Leader in 2022, ranking in the top 5% of the Taiwan Stock Exchange corporate governance evaluation. The Company was named a member of Fortune’s 2023 World’s Most Admired Companies and the Fortune Global 500; Forbes’s World’s Largest Technology Companies in 2023; PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Global Top 100 Companies by market capitalization; and the 2023 Carbon Clean 200TM list issued by the media research company Corporate Knights and the non-profit As You Sow organization. TSMC was honored to be a part of the World Benchmarking Alliance’s SDG2000, the 2,000 Most Influential Companies, and included in Morgan Stanley Capital International’s All Country World Index ESG Leaders, while being ranked AAA by MSCI Research in its ESG Indexes.To promote sustainability, TSMC’s ESG Steering Committee, led by Chairman Dr. Mark Liu, presented the fourth TSMC ESG Award in 2023, honoring internal organizations and divisions for tangible achievements in the Company’s five ESG strategic directions: drive green manufacturing, build a responsible supply chain, create a diverse and inclusive workplace, develop talent, and care for the disadvantaged. At the same time, this award presentation encouraged all employees to propose new ideas for sustainability to be assessed for feasibility and potential incorporation in the Company’s implementation plans. Compared to 1,880 sustainability proposals in the third year, the fourth annual ESG Award generated 3,166 innovative ideas, adding new energy to the Company’s culture of sustainability.Mindful of its global reputation, TSMC employs numerous preventative measures to address potential risks from earthquakes, fires, IT service disruption, yield loss, cyberattacks, supply chain disruption, pandemics, environmental events, and utility supply disruption. TSMC practices crisis management, implements recovery measures to deal with possible crisis events, maintains a crisis command center for control guidelines, and prepares emergency response procedures to ensure timely and prompt responses during a crisis. TSMC also performs regular exercises for crisis scenarios to ensure that crisis management procedures are comprehensive and valid. In 2023, TSMC received a rating of Low ESG Risk from the Sustainalytics ESG Risk Ratings.TSMC’s environment, safety and health committee holds monthly meetings to coordinate with relevant departments in each fab to conduct emergency response drills and continuously improve their notification and operational procedures to ensure clear channels of communication to stakeholders if a crisis arises, with the public relations division serving as the designated gateway for external communications. In 2023, the Board of TSMC took steps to enhance its corporate governance by expanding and strengthening the functions and responsibilities of its committees. The “Audit Committee” was renamed as the “Audit and Risk Committee” to assist the Board in overseeing the quality and integrity of accounting, auditing, reporting, financial control practices, and risk management structure. TSMC also deepened the risk management mechanisms of its overseas subsidiaries by conducting risk management and business continuity management workshops and incident commander trainings. Business continuity plans are also rehearsed and validated through regular exercises to ensure timely and effective responses. These efforts aim to fortify operational resilience and raise risk awareness of operational preparedness across TSMC’s global footprint.If the above-mentioned crisis occurs, relevant personnel at TSMC’s headquarters and global operating locations can deploy comprehensive emergency response measures to eliminate or minimize the impact on personnel safety, environment, property and operations. Responders also involve the public relations division from initial stage to ensure timely, clear and consistent external communication regarding the situation.Risks Associated with Change in ManagementIn 2023 and as of the date of this Annual Report, there were no such risks for TSMC.Risks Regarding Non-Compliance with Export Control, Environmental and Climate Change Related Laws, Regulations and Accords, and Failure to Timely Obtain Requisite Approvals Necessary for Conducting BusinessBecause TSMC engages in manufacturing activities in multiple jurisdictions and conducts business with its customers located worldwide, such activities are subject to a myriad of governmental regulations. For example, the manufacturing, assembling and testing of TSMC’s products require the use of equipment that is subject to export control laws and regulations, as well as metals, chemicals, and materials that are subject to environmental, climate-related, health and safety, and humanitarian forced labor prohibition and conflict-free sourcing laws, regulations and guidelines issued worldwide. The Company’s failure to comply with any such laws or regulations, as amended from time to time, and its failure to comply with any information and document sharing requests from the relevant authorities in a timely manner could result in:●significant penalties and legal liabilities, such as the denial of import or export permits or third party private lawsuits, criminal or administrative proceedings; ●the temporary or permanent suspension of production of the affected products; ●the temporary or permanent inability to procure or use certain production critical chemicals or materials;●unfavorable alterations in TSMC’s manufacturing, fabrication and assembly and test processes; ●challenges from its customers that place TSMC at a significant competitive disadvantage, such as loss of actual or potential sales contracts in case the Company is unable to satisfy the applicable legal standard or customer requirement; ●restrictions on TSMC’s operations or sales; 146147●loss of tax benefits, including termination of current tax incentives, disqualification of tax credit application and repayment of the tax benefits that the Company is not entitled to; and●damages to TSMC’s goodwill and reputation.Complying with applicable laws and regulations, such as environmental and climate related laws and regulations, could also require TSMC, among other things, to do the following: (1) purchase, use or install remedial equipment; (2) implement remedial programs such as climate change mitigation programs and air pollution reduction plans; (3) modify its product designs and manufacturing processes, or incur other significant expenses such as paying any incurred carbon fees if the Company’s emission levels exceed applicable thresholds, and obtaining renewable energy sources, renewable energy certificates or carbon credits, substitute raw materials or chemicals that may cost more or be less available for the Company’s operations.TSMC’s inability to timely obtain approvals necessary for the conduct of its business could impair its operational and financial results. For example, if the Company is unable to timely obtain environmental related approvals needed to undertake the development and construction of a new fab or expansion project, then such inability may delay, limit, or increase the cost of its expansion plans that could also in turn adversely affect its business and operational results. In light of increased public interest in environmental issues, TSMC’s operations and expansion plans may be adversely affected or delayed in response to public concern and social environmental pressures even if the Company complies with all applicable laws and regulations.TSMC believes that climate change should be regarded as a significant corporate risk that must be managed to improve competitiveness. For TSMC’s climate change related risks and control measures, see the “Climate Change and Energy Management” section under “7.2.1 Environmental Protection” on page 158-159 of this Annual Report.6.3.4 Financial RisksEconomic RisksAny future systemic political, economic or financial crisis or market volatility, including but not limited to interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, inflation or deflation or changes in economic, fiscal and monetary policies in major economies, could cause revenue or profits for the semiconductor industry as a whole to decline dramatically. If the economic conditions or financial conditions of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, the demand for its products and services may decrease and additional accounting related allowances may be required, which could reduce TSMC’s operating and net income. ●Interest Rate FluctuationTSMC is exposed to interest rate risks primarily in relation to its investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and fixed income securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as the interest paid on its debt.The objective of TSMC’s investment policy is to achieve a return that will allow the Company to preserve principal and support liquidity requirements. The policy generally requires the Company to invest in investment grade securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The majority of TSMC’s fixed income investments are fixed-rate securities, which are classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (“FVTOCI”) or amortized cost. For those fixed income investments classified as financial assets at FVTOCI, changes in their fair value are recognized through other comprehensive income; for those classified as financial assets at amortized cost, changes in their fair value are not reflected in asset values unless the assets are sold.TSMC has entered and may in the future enter into interest rate derivatives to partially hedge interest rate risk on its fixed income investments and anticipated debt issuance. However, these hedges can offset only a limited portion of the financial impact from movements in interest rates.The majority of TSMC’s debt is fixed-rate and measured at amortized cost and, as such, changes in interest rates would not affect future cash flows or the carrying amount.●Foreign Exchange VolatilitySubstantially all of TSMC’s sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and over half of its capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than the NT dollar, primarily in U.S. dollars, Euros and Japanese yen. As a result, any significant fluctuations to its disadvantage in the exchange rate of the NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on the Company’s revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT dollars. For example, every one percent depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar would result in an approximately 0.4 percentage point decrease in the Company’s operating margin based on its 2023 results.Conversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly versus other major currencies, the demand for the products and services of TSMC’s customers and for its goods and services will likely decrease, which will negatively affect the Company’s revenue.TSMC uses foreign currency derivatives contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, and non-derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency denominated debts, to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-NT dollar-denominated assets and liabilities, investments in foreign subsidiaries, and certain forecasted transactions. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on its assets and liabilities.Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the NT dollar may affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s common shares and the market price of the Company’s American Depositary Shares (ADSs) as well as any cash dividends paid in NT dollars on TSMC’s common shares represented by ADSs.●InflationTSMC is subject to the effects of inflation through increases in the cost of items such as raw materials and equipment used to produce its products, wage expenses and employee benefits, electricity costs, and costs in relation to construction of fabs. Although TSMC does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations to date, a high inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to maintain current levels of profit margin if the selling prices of its products and services do not increase with these increased costs.Amendments to Tax Regulations or Implementation of New Tax LawsAny amendments to existing tax regulations or the implementation of any new tax laws in the jurisdictions in which TSMC operates its business may have an adverse effect on its net income.While the Company is subject to tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which it operates or conducts business, TSMC’s principal operations are in the R.O.C. and it is exposed primarily to taxes levied by the R.O.C. government. The R.O.C. Controlled Foreign Company (“CFC”) rules enacted in 2016 have been implemented since January 1, 2023, pursuant to which, certain profits retained at a CFC located in a low-tax jurisdiction would be taxable at its parent company in Taiwan. On the other hand, effective from January 1, 2023, the R.O.C. Statute for Industrial Innovation was amended such that eligible companies that develop innovative technologies domestically and possess leading position in global supply chain may claim investment tax credit of 25% on qualified R&D expenditure and 5% on procurement of machinery/equipment for advanced processes over a fiscal year. The Company is eligible for these new incentives pursuant to the R.O.C. Statute for Industrial Innovation. Further, changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project that was undertaken by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). These changes may increase tax uncertainty and have an adverse effect on TSMC’s operating results.In order to control tax risk, the Company closely monitors all domestic and foreign governmental policies and regulations that might impact its financial operations. TSMC has established risk management procedures to collect information, analyze potential tax implications, and develop countermeasures.Risks Associated with External FinancingIn times of market instability, sufficient external financing may not be available to the Company on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms to the Company, or at all. If sufficient external financing is not available when TSMC needs such financing to meet its capital requirements, the Company may be forced to curtail its expansion, modify plans or delay the deployment of new or expanded services until it obtains such financing.Risks Associated with High-Risk/Highly Leveraged Investments; Lending, Endorsements, and Guarantees for Other Parties; and Financial Derivative TransactionsIn 2023 and as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC made no high-risk or highly leveraged financial investments. All financial derivative transactions engaged by TSMC were strictly for hedging and not for trading or speculative purposes. All guarantees and intercompany loans provided by TSMC and 148149its subsidiaries were solely for TSMC and/or its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All guarantees and intercompany loans were in compliance with relevant rules and regulations.To manage risks of various financial transactions, TSMC has established internal control policies and procedures based on sound financial and business practices, all in compliance with the relevant rules and regulations issued by the R.O.C. Financial Supervisory Commission. TSMC’s policies and procedures include Procedures for Financial Derivatives Transactions, Procedures for Lending Funds to Other Parties, Procedures for Acquisition or Disposal of Assets, and Procedures for Endorsement and Guarantee.Risks Associated with Impairment ChargesUnder Taiwan-IFRSs, TSMC is required to evaluate its tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. If certain criteria are met, TSMC is required to record an impairment charge. TSMC is not able to estimate the extent or timing of any impairment charge for future years. Any impairment charge required may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s net income.The determination of an impairment charge at any given time is mainly based on the projected results of operations over several years subsequent to that time. Consequently, an impairment charge is more likely to occur during a period when the Company’s operating results are otherwise already depressed. See “Note 5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION AND UNCERTAINTY” in Annual Report section (II), Financial Statements for a discussion of how TSMC assesses if an impairment charge is required and, if so, how the amount is determined.6.3.5 Other RisksPotential Impact and Risks Associated with Sales of Significant Numbers of Shares by TSMC’s Directors, and/or Shareholders Who Own 10% or More of TSMC’s Total Outstanding SharesThe value of TSMC shareholders’ investment may be reduced by possible future sales of TSMC shares owned by major shareholders.As of the date of this Annual Report, no single shareholder owned 10% or more of TSMC’s total outstanding shares.Risks of Trade PoliciesAs TSMC’s revenue is primarily derived from sales to major economies in the world (please refer to “2.2.4 TSMC Position, Differentiation and Strategy” on page 19-21 of this annual report), any changes in the trade policies (such as the increase of tariffs on certain products, the implementation of import and export controls, and the adoption of other trade barriers) of such major economies can affect the sales of TSMC or its customers and thereby affect TSMC’s operating results.In 2020, the U.S. tightened its export control measures against Huawei Technology Co. Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, “Huawei”). To comply with relevant laws and regulations, TSMC has discontinued shipment of products to Huawei since September 2020. Since February 2022, there have been expansive sanctions and export controls imposed by several countries and regions against Russia, including certain individuals and entities, in connection with the military conflict in Ukraine. In October 2022 and October 2023, the U.S. adopted additional export controls over specified countries (including China) under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“U.S. EAR”) on certain advanced computing integrated circuits (“ICs”), computer commodities that contain such ICs, and certain semiconductor manufacturing items, as well as controls on transactions involving items for supercomputer and semiconductor manufacturing end-uses. The new controls add new license requirements for items subject to the U.S. EAR where the items are destined to a semiconductor fabrication facility in China that fabricates ICs meeting specified advanced node parameters as well as for U.S. persons’ activities supporting such facility or semiconductor manufacturing items. In October 2022, the Company secured a one-year general authorization from the U.S. government, which allows TSMC to maintain the Company’s fab’s operations in Nanjing, China. This general authorization has been renewed and extended to be effective until May 31, 2024. TSMC is also applying for a Validated End-User (the “VEU”) authorization for its Nanjing fab, which, once obtained, would be a permanent authorization that allows the Company to receive exports of eligible items from the U.S. without separate licenses. However, there is no assurance that TSMC will be able to obtain the VEU authorization for our Nanjing fab or that the obtained general authorization will not be terminated in the future. On the other hand, measures adopted by an affected country to counteract the impact of another country’s actions or regulations could lead to significant legal liability to multinational corporations including our own. For example, in January 2021, China adopted a blocking statute that, among other matters, entitles Chinese entities incurring damages from a multinational’s compliance with foreign laws to seek civil remedies.Imposition of trade barriers, including protectionist measures, sanctions and import and export controls (including without limitation the export control measures mentioned in the foregoing paragraph), could increase TSMC’s manufacturing costs, limit TSMC’s access to certain supplies, make TSMC’s pricing less competitive, and impact the sales of TSMC or its customers. In 2023 and as of the date of this annual report, our current results of operations have not been materially affected. Nevertheless, depending on future developments of global trade tensions, such relevant regulations, rules, or measures may have an adverse impact on the Company’s business and operations, and TSMC may incur significant legal liability and financial losses as a result.TSMC continues to monitor the recent shifts in trade policies and measures among the relevant major economies and will take corresponding responsive actions in accordance with subsequent developments.150151Fab 6TSMC is the only semiconductor company to be selected as a component of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for 23 consecutive years.7Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG)1521537.1 OverviewTSMC actively implements ESG management following three missions: Acting with Integrity, Strengthening Environmental Protection, and Caring for the Disadvantaged. In so doing, the Company seeks maximum achievements as the leading technology and capacity provider of the global logic IC industry and strives to establish mutually beneficial interaction with all stakeholders – employees, shareholders/investors, customers, suppliers/contractors, governments/associations and society as a whole – aiming to create sustainable value and to be a force for positive change. Guidance for Implementing – ESGWith the vision of Uplifting Society, TSMC has formulated its ESG Policy as the overarching guiding principle for sustainable development, in which the ESG Matrix, established by the Company’s founder Dr. Morris Chang, clearly defines the scope of its ESG responsibilities. TSMC strives to carry out its ESG commitment in seven areas: morality, business ethics, economy, rule of law, sustainability, work-life balance and happiness, and philanthropy. Actions that TSMC has taken to fulfill these commitments are integrity, law compliance, anti-corruption/anti-bribery/anti-cronyism, environmental protection/climate control/energy conservation, corporate governance, providing well-paying jobs, generating good shareholder return, employee work-life balance, encouraging innovation and a good work environment. TSMC also advances ESG through its Charity Foundation and Education and Culture Foundation to fulfill corporate citizenship responsibilities.TSMC ESG MatrixSocietyTSMC MoralityBusiness EthicsEconomyRule of LawSustainabilityWork/Life Balance HappinessPhilanthropyIntegrity VVLaw Compliance VAnti-CorruptionAnti-BriberyAnti-CronyismVVVEnvironmental ProtectionClimate ControlEnergy Conservation VVCorporate Governance VVVProvide Well-Paying Jobs VVGood Shareholder Return VEmployees’ Work-Life BalanceVEncourage Innovation VVGood Work Environment VTSMC Charity Foundation VVVTSMC Education and Culture Foundation VVVESG ManagementTSMC has established the ESG Steering Committee as the highest level of ESG decision-making, chaired by the Company’s Chairman, while the Chairperson of the ESG Committee serves as executive secretary, and other members are senior executives from a wide variety of functions. All work together to examine material ESG issues in relation to the Company’s operations, set the short-, medium- and long-term strategic directions that link to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).The ESG Committee functions to coordinate and integrate resources, and facilitate communication among various divisions, implementing the resolutions of the Company’s ESG Steering Committee. The ESG Department, on behalf of the ESG Committee, works together with cross-organizational representatives to identify key sustainability issues in relation to the Company’s operations and stakeholders’ concerns. Task forces are formed to address various issues and frame adaptive strategies, goals and action plans. The ESG Committee holds quarterly meetings to track progress and ensure the strategies are implemented effectively in daily operations. At the same time, every quarter the chairperson of the ESG Committee reports on the implementation of plans and results to the Board of Directors/Nominating, Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, under whose supervision the ESG Committee continues to improve TSMC’s sustainability management policies, strategies, and goal setting and deepen sustainable development. In 2023, TSMC focused primarily on green manufacturing and supply chain management (including net zero emissions, renewable energy access and use, biodiversity strategy, and low-carbon value chain management), diverse and inclusive workplace, and talent development (including a series of activities promoting diversity and inclusion, conducting human rights due diligence, deepening high school students’ science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs), and public welfare investments such as the Public Welfare Green Energy Project. TSMC also planned and oversaw ESG budgets for 2023 and 2024.

External experts have also been invited to discuss the potential risks of occupational diseases in the semiconductor manufacturing process and prevention plans for such diseases. To mitigate health risks to employees, suppliers and contractors in the workplace, TSMC has adopted rigorous safety and health control measures focused on preventing occupational injuries and diseases and promoting employee safety, physical and mental health.To minimize supply chain risk and fulfill corporate social responsibility, TSMC not only follows ESH best practices internally but also strives to improve the ESH performance of its suppliers and contractors through audits and counselling.TSMC uses priority work management and self-management to govern services provided by contractors. The Company requires contractors performing level-one high-risk operations to complete certification for technicians and to establish their own ISO 45001 safety and health management system. The emphasis on self-management nurtures the sense of responsibility, with the goal of promoting safety awareness and technical improvement for all contractors in the industry. For onsite contractor personnel, TSMC has standardized courses on safety and health and increased the frequency of such courses to improve training effectiveness and safety awareness. To ensure that the Company’s safety protocols are accurately delivered to contractors on a timely basis, TSMC has established a digital platform for mutual communication so that onsite operational risks can be mitigated.TSMC collaborates with suppliers to manage the sustainability of the supply chain, including formulating supplier sustainability standards, drawing up audit plans, performing audits and tracking improvements, coaching and training, and additional instruction for suppliers with subpar performance. Strengthening the professional capabilities of suppliers in environmental protection, safety and health, fire response, and carbon inventory were key focuses in 2023. To achieve the goal, the Company held the environmental protection, safety and health workshops (57 participants from 52 suppliers), fire emergency response workshops (60 participants from 51 suppliers), supplier carbon inventory workshops (28 participants from 24 suppliers) and environmental protection, safety and health workshops for suppliers’ senior managers (29 participants from 17 suppliers). In addition, for the past eight years suppliers have been invited to observe TSMC’s annual emergency response drills (accumulated 195 participants from 190 suppliers) and the Company’s environmental, safety and health sustainability forum focused on successful case sharing certifications are maintained and valid. Per TSMC policy, all new facilities are required to attain the aforementioned certifications within 18 months after receiving their facility operating license.To reduce overall environmental, safety and health risks, TSMC strives for continuous improvement and actively seeks to enhance climate-change management, pollution prevention and control, power and resource conservation, waste reduction and recycling, safety and health management, and fire and explosion prevention, as well as to minimize the impact of earthquake damage.In order to meet regulatory and customer requirements for the management of hazardous materials, TSMC has adopted the IECQ QC 080000 hazardous substance process management (HSPM) system. All TSMC fabs have been QC 080000 certified and have maintained validity since 2007. Through the establishment of QC 080000, TSMC ensures that its products comply with customer requirements and international regulations including the European Union’s Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive, the EU’s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, the “halogen-free in electronic products” initiative, perfluorooctane sulfonates (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and related substances restriction standards. In addition, in 2016 TSMC started a project to minimize usage of the hazardous substance N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) and as a result by the end of 2022 NMP use in the Company’s Taiwan fabs had been reduced by 97.2% compared to the use in 2016. In 2023, TSMC continued to further reduce NMP usage in its subsidiary fabs and expected to complete process replacement in 2024.In 2011, TSMC began implementing the ISO 50001 energy management system for continuous improvement in energy conservation. In 2022, all TSMC and its subsidiaries’ manufacturing facilities had received ISO 50001 Energy Management System certification and has maintained the certification validity until now except for TSMC Washington. TSMC Washington in the U.S. plans to receive this certification in 2024.Aiming to establish the healthiest possible workplace, in 2017 TSMC formed a corporate-level health promotion committee led by executives at the vice president level to address on an ad-hoc basis occupational disease cases or other health issues. The committee members include site directors, managers of safety and health department, and representatives from 158159(359 participants from 117 suppliers). TSMC also conducts environmental, safety and health audits at supplier manufacturing sites and actively assists suppliers in improving their ESH performance. Finally, the Company requests that suppliers conduct a carbon emissions inventory and encourages them to implement measures to save energy, reduce carbon emissions, conserve water and reduce waste. 7.2.1 Environmental ProtectionClimate Change and Energy Management●Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)In view of the potential financial risks of climate change on operations, in 2018 TSMC adopted TCFD recommendations released by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to identify risks and opportunities and further establish metrics and management targets based on the results identified.

In response to threats presented by extreme weather, TSMC sets strategies and targets, ensures sound execution and strives to build a sustainable culture. In 2021, TSMC announced its long-term goal of net zero emissions by 2050, while setting the short-term goal of zero growth in emissions by 2025. By actively implementing emission reduction measures, the Company is working to return its carbon emissions to 2020 levels by 2030.The Company actively participates in the initiatives of the World Semiconductor Council (WSC), and has leveraged its past experience to develop best practices, which have been fully adopted and implemented by the Company since 2012, to reduce perfluorinated compounds (PFC) emissions. In 2013, in accordance with the Ministry of Environment’s regulation Early Actions for Carbon Credit of Greenhouse Gases Reduction, TSMC applied for recognition of GHG reduction from 2005 to 2011 and received 5.28 million tons of carbon dioxide credits in 2015. Those carbon credits can be used to offset GHG emissions of new manufacturing facilities regulated by Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Act, which can support the Company’s sustainable operations and mitigate climate-change risk.Since 2005, TSMC has completed the GHG inventory program and taken a complete inventory of its GHG emissions to gain ISO 14064 certification. The inventory shows that the major direct GHG emissions are PFCs, which are widely used in the semiconductor manufacturing process. The primary indirect GHG emission is electricity consumption. The analysis of the inventory data was performed not only to meet domestic regulatory reporting requirements but also to serve as a baseline reference for the Company’s strategy to reduce GHG emissions. Since 2005, TSMC has also participated in the international disclosure and rating agency CDP to publicly disclose climate change information for 19 consecutive years and to continuously review and improve related management practices.In response to the commitment of global climate summit Paris Agreement and the Republic of China’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act promulgated in 2015, TSMC initiated a cross-functional platform for carbon management in 2016. The three areas of focus of this platform are legal compliance, emission reduction, and carbon credit acquisition. In addition to participating in official regulatory consultation and communications meetings, the Company also sets short-, medium- and long-term reduction targets through the Energy Saving and Carbon Reduction Committee led by the fab operations vice president. The measures are carried out by energy and carbon reduction teams of individual fabs. Because more than 80% of TSMC’s GHG emissions come from electricity consumption, the Company emphasizes energy conservation and carbon reduction initiatives. TSMC has not only implemented energy-conserving designs in its manufacturing fabs and offices but has also continuously improved the energy efficiency in operating its facilities. These efforts simultaneously reduce carbon dioxide gas emissions and costs. As a result, TSMC has conserved 3.9 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of power since 2016. In February 2023, Taiwan renamed the “Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act” to the “Climate Change Response Act” and amended the provisions. Relevant laws and regulations are being formulated. TSMC will continue to monitor and evaluate the potential impact on the Company, so as to respond early.(Continued)160161Since 2018, TSMC began to aggressively negotiate the purchase of renewable energy with suppliers in Taiwan. Targeting a long-term commitment of 100% renewable energy, TSMC has committed to achieving 60% renewable energy by 2030. Since 2018, the overseas manufacturing fabs and offices have purchased renewable energy, REC and carbon credits to offset all carbon emissions caused by power consumption. All TSMC overseas sites achieved net zero emissions in 2023 again. Although development of renewable energy in Taiwan is in an early stage, TSMC has established a renewable energy task force and continues to communicate closely with government. In the hope that the collaboration would speed up renewable energy development in Taiwan, the Company has made recommendations to the government. TSMC continues to find renewable energy. By the end of 2023, the total installation capacity of renewable energy contracted reached 3.1GW (gigawatts). The renewable energy will be provided to TSMC gradually after the related business process has been completed. This is a clear manifestation of the Company’s active support of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In 2020, TSMC became the first semiconductor company to join RE100, the global corporate renewable energy initiative, and pledged that power consumption of all the Company’s manufacturing plants and offices would be 100% supplied from renewable energy by 2050. In 2023, TSMC further announced the acceleration of the RE100 sustainability process in response to climate change and mitigation of climate impacts by moving up the original goal from 2050 to 2040.TSMC GHG Reduction Target and Achievement StatusStrategy2030 Goal2023 Target and AchievementAchievement StatusContinue to use best available technology to reduce GHG emissions and become an industry leader in low-carbon manufacturingReduce GHG emissions per unit product (metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e)/12-inch equivalent wafer mask layer) by 30% (Base year: 2020)Reduced GHG emissions per unit product (metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e)/12-inch equivalent wafer mask layer) increased by 31% (Target: -9%)Unachieved (Note)Note:  Due to the impact of the global economic cycle, the overall production capacity of TSMC in 2023 did not meet expectations, resulting in an increase in unit product GHG emission and failure to achieve the annual target. Therefore, TSMC will continue to implement energy saving and carbon reduction related actions.Air and Water Pollution ControlThe Company has installed air and water pollution control equipment in each fab to meet regulatory emissions requirements. In addition, TSMC maintains backup pollution control systems, including emergency power supplies, to mitigate the risk of pollutant emissions in the event of equipment failure. The Company centrally monitors the operations of its air and water pollution control equipment 24 hours a day by rotating staff and treats system effectiveness as an important tracking item to ensure the quality of emitted air and discharged water.To further enhance water resources management, TSMC has adopted and followed the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) standard, the sustainable water management standard. In 2022, TSMC AWS certified fabs (Note) in Taiwan's three science parks including Hsinchu, Central Taiwan and Southern Taiwan obtained AWS Platinum certification – the highest level available and it has maintained it platinum-level certification in subsequent years.Furthermore, the Company has upgraded the internal water platform (Water Map) to diverse water supply integration platform. In addition to improving use interface, the platform also includes diverse water use information like reclaimed water quality and quantity to fully grasp and manage the usage of water within the fab from all aspects, not only continuously tracks water reservoir capacity but also monitors in-house water quality and quantity. Based on the water balance diagram, it further integrates the water usage flow, flow rate, and recycling mechanisms to calculate the recovery rate, discharge rate, and water usage of each unit to improve water recycling rate. In 2023, TSMC continued to implement four major water saving measures: improving the water production rate of the system, reducing facility system water consumption, increasing the wastewater recycling of facilities, and decreasing water discharge loss from the system, and the overall system has increased recycled water use by 4.28 million cubic meters.The goal of water management at TSMC is to optimize utilization of every drop of water. In addition to positively implementing process water-saving measures, TSMC collaborates with industrial, governmental, and academic organizations to invest in the development of water reclamation technology. Through participation in the professional committee activities of the Taiwan Science Park Association, TSMC shares water-saving experiences and professional knowledge with semiconductor industry peers to achieve the common goal of the entire park and ensure long-term water resource supply-demand balance. In order to further circulate the use of water resources and support the government’s promotion of reclaimed water policy, TSMC launched the Southern Taiwan Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant operation in September 2022, the first private water reclamation plant in Taiwan, and introduced reclaimed water into the semiconductor manufacturing process. In addition to reclaimed water supplied by TSMC’s Southern Taiwan Science Park Reclaimed Water Plant, TSMC’s fabs in Southern Taiwan Science Park started using reclaimed water supplied by the Yongkang reclaimed water plant and the Anping reclaimed water plant when they started up in later 2022 and early 2023 respectively. The supply of above reclaimed water exceeded 62.5 thousand cubic meters per day in 2023. By the end of 2023, 1.261 million cubic meters of reclaimed water had been used in the semiconductor manufacturing process in TSMC’s Tainan fabs, helping the Tainan fabs reduce city water usage by 21% and TSMC reach the replacement rate of reclaimed water up to 12%. TSMC commits to continuing to increase the utilization of reclaimed water in newly constructed fabs in the future.TSMC Water Usage in Recent Two YearsYearTotal Water Usage (m3) (Note 1)Unit Product Water Usage (L/12-inch wafer-e-layer)2023113,610,463176.42022104,681,272137.3TSMC Water Usage Reduction Target and Achievement StatusStrategy2030 Goal2023 Target and AchievementAchievement StatusEnforce climate change mitigation policies, implement water conservation and water shortage adaptation measuresReduce unit water consumption (liter/12-inch equivalent wafer mask layer) by 30% (Base year: 2010)Increased unit water consumption by 25.24% (Target: -2.7%)Unachieved (Note 2)Note 1: Includes TSMC fabs in Taiwan and subsidiaries total use of city water and reclaimed water.Note 2:  Due to the impact of the global economic cycle, the overall production capacity of TSMC in 2023 did not meet expectations, resulting in an increase in unit product water consumption and failure to achieve the annual target. Therefore, TSMC will continue to implement process water saving and the use of reclaimed water.Waste Management and Recycling In recent years, as TSMC continued to develop advanced processes and expand capacity rapidly both at home and overseas, waste production has increased due to the complexity of new process development, demand for reliable yield rates, and increasing use of raw materials.To achieve the goal of sustainable resource utilization, TSMC has a designated unit responsible for waste recycling and disposal. The priorities are process waste reduction onsite and offsite recycling and regeneration, with incineration and landfill as the least desirable final option. In 2017, TSMC amended its articles of incorporation to add four business items for chemical materials to enhance waste process flow and reduce risks of improper waste disposal by commissioned agencies. It also set up onsite resource activation facilities to convert waste resources produced during manufacturing process into products to be used onsite or to sell to other industries. TSMC recycled copper sulfate waste, cobalt-containing liquid waste, sulfuric acid waste and ammonium sulfate waste, all of which were regenerated into products. The Company also developed a system of cryolite synthesis whereby hydrogen fluoride (HF) waste is recycled and regenerated into raw material that can be used in other industries. As a result, the Company has become a leader in waste resources regeneration. At the same time, TSMC’s fabs in Taiwan achieved a 95% waste recycling rate for the ninth consecutive year, with a landfill rate below 1% for the 14th consecutive year. Furthermore, TSMC’s Taiwan fabs became the first semiconductor facilities in the world to jointly obtain the highest platinum rating for UL 2799 certification in 2023. This achievement builds on the success of TSMC’s Fab 12 Phase 1 and Phase 2 in gaining the UL 2799 platinum certification in 2021.

The Company carefully selects waste disposal and recycling vendors that are certified and have required permits. TSMC regularly checks the onsite operational status, disposal declaration forms, operational records, etc., to compare with actual reuse and disposal, and takes proactive steps to strengthen vendor auditing. For example, all waste transportation contractors have agreed to join the GPS Satellite Fleet so that the cleanup transportation routes and abnormal stays for all trucks can be traced. All waste recycling and disposal vendors have installed closed-circuit TV systems at operating sites to monitor and audit waste handling. At the same time, to further guarantee proper waste handling, in 2022 TSMC built the system of waste intelligent fast track (S.W.I.F.T.) and completed five different types of waste treatment vendors for pilot testing. As of 2023, 29% of waste treatment vendors have instituted S.W.I.F.T. and TSMC intends to roll it out to all waste treatment vendors in 2030. Using AI technology in lieu of in-person on-site spot checks increases inspection efficiency 65-fold and reduces manual inspection by 13,000 hours each year. In addition, TSMC conducts ongoing surveys of recycled product tracking and requires all recycling contractors to report their recycled product sales monthly to track waste flow and ensure that actions are taken to adhere to lawful and proper waste recycling and treatment. Environmental AccountingThe purpose of TSMC’s environmental accounting system is to identify and quantify environmental costs for internal management. At the same time, the Company also calculates and evaluates the savings or economic benefits of environmental protection programs so as to continuously promote economically effective programs. While environmental expenses are expected to continue to rise, environmental accounting can help manage these costs more effectively. TSMC’s environmental accounting measures various environmental costs, establishes independent environmental account codes, and provides the data to all units for use in annual budgeting. The Company’s economic benefit evaluation calculates cost savings for energy conservation, water or waste reductions and recycling benefits in accordance with its environmental protection programs. The benefits disclosed in this report include real income from projects such as waste recycling as well as savings from major environmental projects. In 2023, the total benefits of environmental protection programs of TSMC fabs including waste recycling exceeded NT$3,160 million.2023 Environmental Cost of TSMC Fabs in TaiwanUnit: NT$ thousandsClassificationDescriptionExpenseInvestment1.

All TSMC fabs in Taiwan have received Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System (TOSHMS) certification since 2009. In 2018, the International Organization for Standardization released ISO 45001: 2018, replacing OHSAS 18001, with major changes in the expansion of the scope, support and participation of the leadership, collection and planning of internal and external issues, the expectations and demands of stakeholders, the assessment of risk inspections, communication and consultation with non-managers, the application of performance indicators, and the evaluation of corrective and preventive actions. Meanwhile, ISO 45001 ensures the spirit of the system can be effectively implemented at the management level through management review, internal audit, automatic check, and security patrol to identify safety concerns and opportunities for improvement. All Company fabs in Taiwan received ISO 45001 certification for occupational health and safety in 2019 and all TSMC subsidiaries obtained the certification in 2020. All the above certifications have been maintained. New facilities, including TSMC Arizona, Japan Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing, Inc. (JASM), are required to receive aforementioned certifications within 18 months upon receiving facility license per TSMC’s internal policy.In addition to accident prevention, TSMC has established emergency response procedures to protect employees and contractors if a disaster should occur, as well as to prevent and/or reduce the negative impact on the community and the environment. TSMC communicates regularly with suppliers to ensure that the potential risk in operating production equipment is minimized and that safety control procedures are followed rigorously during installation. The Company places stringent controls on high-risk operations and also evaluates the seismic tolerance of its facilities and equipment to reduce the risk of earthquake damage.For epidemics, TSMC has established corporate-level prevention committees and procedures for emergency response to outbreaks of infectious diseases.Working Environment and Employee Safety and Health ProtectionThe Company’s ESH policy is focused on establishing a safe working environment, preventing occupational injury and illness, keeping employees healthy, enhancing every employee’s awareness and sense of accountability to ESH, and building a strong ESH culture.There were a total of 48 occupational injuries at TSMC in 2023, involving 48 people, representing approximately 0.07% of the total number of employees. The disabling injury frequency rate (FR) was 0.35, under the 0.4 target, and the disability injury severity rate (SR) was 4, not meeting the target of less than 4. TSMC is reviewing potential improvement measures, such as the promotion of safety culture-related posters or animations to strengthen employee safety awareness. By implementing interactive communication training courses on safety culture, TSMC can integrate safety into daily life and encourage employees to proactively discuss safety-related issues. To reduce sports injuries, it is mandatory for the welfare committee and departments to conduct risk identification and hazard reminders before organizing sports activities. The Company continuously observes operations and conducts compliance inspections to identify potential injury risks in the workplace and implement improvement measures to enhance workplace safety. In addition to regular reviews, the caring program for employees has been enhanced and managers have been directed to pay closer attention to the physical and mental state of employees to ensure their safety and health while at work.TSMC safety and health management operations apply to the following:●Equipment Safety and Health Management In addition to meeting regulatory requirements and internal standards, as well as mitigating ESH-related risks when building or expanding facilities, TSMC also maintains procedures governing new equipment and raw materials, requires safety approvals for bringing new tools online, updates safety rules, and implements seismic protection and other safety measures.TSMC requires that all new tools meet SEMI-S8 requirements and that appropriate supplementary control measures be taken to reduce ergonomic risk. Moreover, the Company endeavors to automate the transportation of 300mm front-opening unified pods (FOUPs) to prevent cumulative physical injury caused by repetitive manual handling of this equipment. TSMC 300mm fabs have all converted to automatic transportation control.●Environmental, Safety and Health Evaluation of New Tools and New Chemical Substances As a technology leader in the global semiconductor industry, TSMC operates increasingly diversified process tools and introduces new chemicals in the R&D stage. Before using new tools or new chemicals, they are reviewed carefully by the new tool and new chemical review committee.

A total of 417 cases of new tools and chemical substances were approved by the new tool and new chemical review committee in 2023 after they were evaluated and reviewed in accordance with the aforementioned standards and before entering TSMC.●General Safety Management, Training and AuditAll TSMC manufacturing facilities hold environmental, safety and health committee meetings on a monthly basis. TSMC has adopted multiple preventive measures such as controls on high-risk work, contractor management, chemical safety management, personal protective equipment requirements, and safety audit management. In addition, the Company maintains detailed disaster response procedures and performs regular drills designed to minimize injuries to employees and damage to property, as well as the impact on society and the environment in the event of a disaster.   TSMC Safety-related Training and Promotion in Recent Two YearsYearTotal Number of Employees Who Have Completed Safety-related Training2023297,4032022271,702●Working Environment Hazardous Factors Management TSMC conducts workplace hazard assessments to provide a comfortable, safe workplace for employees. The Company also educates employees and requires them, when appropriate, to use personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent hazardous exposures.The Company performs semi-annual workplace environment assessments of physical and chemical hazards, including CO2 concentration, illumination, noise, and hazardous chemical substances as regulated by local laws. In addition, TSMC performs exposure assessments and uses hierarchy management control for chemicals with potential health hazards. If abnormal measurements occur, events happen, or an exposure assessment indicates there is an adverse health effect on employees, ESH professionals immediately conduct onsite observation and intervention to reduce the risk of hazardous factors exposure to acceptable levels.●Health Promotion ProgramIn order to establish the healthiest possible workplace and reduce the incidence of occupational disease, TSMC formed a corporate-level committee to carry out health promotion programs covering three key areas:1.  Exposure and health risk assessment: develop an exposure assessment system to identify high health risk employees.2.  Hazardous training and notification: use standardized training materials for employees and contractors in all TSMC fabs. Inform them of the health risks and prevention measures at the workplace before they begin working or providing any services there.3.  Strengthening management of chemicals with significant health risks: request suppliers that all materials they provide to TSMC comply with applicable laws including clear disclosure of any hazardous substances. Perform sampling of raw materials used in the manufacturing process to confirm that they do not contain any carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic-reproductive materials as claimed on supplier’s safety data sheet (SDS). ●Emergency ResponseThe planning and execution of an effective emergency response requires identifying potential high-risk events via risk assessment and being prepared for various scenarios. It should focus on continuous improvements and drills covering all potentially serious events. TSMC’s emergency response plans include procedures for rapid-response crisis management and disaster recovery for potential incidents.All TSMC fabs conduct major annual emergency response exercises and evacuation drills. TSMC’s onsite service contractors are also required to participate in emergency response planning and exercises to ensure cooperation in handling accidents and to effectively minimize any damage caused by disasters. In 2023, the Company held 132 evacuation drills and 36 fire drills. At least every two years, each fab director invites fab management and support functions to participate in business continuity drills for potentially high-risk events such as earthquake, fire and flood (at the Tainan site). Since 2018, TSMC has conducted complex accident emergency response drills, which include simultaneous scenarios for earthquake, fire and chemical spills to ensure rapid response 168169to emergencies so that losses can be minimized in the event of a real disaster. In 2020, TSMC took the lead in the industry to introduce the all-hazard approach as recommended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to conduct disaster prevention exercises. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, TSMC added tabletop exercises to disaster prevention training in an effort to minimize the risks of group infections that may arise as a result of full-scale exercises. The inclusion of tabletop exercises also aids in the verification of full-scale exercise procedures to make disaster response more comprehensive, thus effectively mitigating the impact of various types of disasters on business continuity in the future. As of 2023, in addition to 644 sessions of tabletop exercises, 91 full-scale exercises had also been completed.In addition to the regular emergency response drills held by engineering and facilities departments each quarter, the Company’s laboratory, canteen, dormitory, and shuttle bus personnel also hold emergency response drills to prepare for events such as earthquakes, chemical spills, ammonia release, fires and traffic accidents.●Emerging Infectious Disease ResponseTSMC has a dedicated corporate ESH organization to monitor emerging infectious diseases around the world, to assess any potential impact on the workplace, and to provide an appropriate strategic response plan. In previous outbreaks such as SARS in 2003, H1N1 influenza in 2009, and MERS in 2015, as well as with COVID-19 from 2019 to 2023, TSMC followed the Taiwan CDC’s (Center for Disease Control) rules and convened the corporate influenza response committee to develop the Company’s strategies. These strategies included educating employees in prevention and response, publishing guidelines for managers, establishing guidelines for employee sick leave, and installing alcohol-based hand sanitizers at appropriate locations. The Committee also monitors the status of employee leave due to illness and, at the same time, develops a continuity plan to address manpower shortages and minimize business impact. For example during the COVID-19 outbreak, in order to protect the health of TSMC employees, their families, and work partners, employees were encouraged to be fully vaccinated if in healthy condition. In addition, TSMC reviewed the situation from time to time and formulated appropriate preventive measures such as daily body temperature checks and updated vaccination information before entering Company facilities and continued to follow epidemic prevention recommendations such as mask wearing, frequent hand washing and social distancing.●Employee Physical and Mental Health EnhancementTSMC believes that employee physical and mental health is not only fundamental to maintaining sound business operations but is also an important part of a corporation’s responsibility. To preserve and promote the physical and mental health of its employees, TSMC fosters collaboration among the onsite industrial safety and environmental protection department, the onsite medical personnel of the health center, and physicians of occupational medicine. TSMC strives to reduce cerebral and cardiovascular conditions or injuries that might be induced or aggravated by overwork, night work or shift work. The Company conducts programs for maternal health protection and for prevention of cumulative trauma disorders as well. TSMC devotes significant resources to mental health awareness, focused not only on hazards at work but also on employee health in general. In 2023, planned personal health management activities included: (1) 497 female employees participated in the maternal health program, and the completion rate was 100%. 496 of them were at first degree risk, where there was no potential harm to the mother or infant. One female employee was assessed as second degree risk, with potential harm to the mother or infant, but after proper adjustments to her work duties, her risk was downgraded to first degree. (2) Through analysis of historical cerebral and cardiovascular cases of its employees, TSMC sharpened the disease assessment criteria used by contracted doctors, and, in combination with internal annual health examination reports and work scheduling information, the Company was able to identify 2,830 employees with middle to high risk for cerebral and cardiovascular diseases. These employees were provided with health education and medical assistance. Also, they and their managers received recommended changes in working hours and shifts to reduce health risks. (3) 170 employees were identified as high risk for cumulative trauma disorders, including one who might also have job-related risks, and the Company adjusted working conditions accordingly to reduce potential risks. (4) As obesity has been considered as a precursor to hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension and insomnia, TSMC has held health promotion programs for several consecutive years. In 2023, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and catering to the younger generation’s preference for social and video media, apart from physical weight loss activities (5,782 participants; total weight loss reached 5,263 kg),TSMC conducted a series of online interactive activities including: (a) Fourteen sessions of “Health Lecture Online” with 7,142 attendees in total; (b) Nine health workshops with a total of 238 person-times; (c) Activities of World Mental Health Day with a total of 2,189 attendees. The above activities have all received positive feedback from employees. In the future, the Company will continue to implement relevant promotional activities to take care of the health of employees.7.2.4 Supplier ManagementManagement AspectFor better supply chain management, TSMC is committed to communicating with and encouraging its suppliers and contractors to increase their quality, cost effectiveness and delivery performance, and make continuous improvement in supply chain sustainability. Through regular communication with senior managers, site audits and experience sharing, the Company collaborates with major suppliers and contractors to enhance partnerships and ensure continued improvement of performance and increased joint contributions to society. As noted above, contractors performing high-risk activities must lay out clearly defined safety precautions and preventative measures. In addition, contractors working on high-risk engineering projects must establish ISO 45001 or OHSAS 18001 systems and the workers must successfully complete work-related skill training. All contractors performing high-risk activities obtained ISO 45001 certification before the end of 2021.Supply Chain SustainabilityTSMC works with suppliers in several fields of sustainable development, such as greening the supply chain, carbon management for climate change, mitigation of fire risk, ESH management and business continuity plans in the event of a natural disaster. Since becoming a full member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) in 2015, TSMC has completed implementation of the RBA code of conduct throughout the Company by performing self-assessments at its facilities worldwide and reviewing policies and procedures in the areas of labor, health and safety, environment, ethics and management systems. To enhance supply chain sustainability and streamline risk management, the Company is committed to collaborating with its suppliers to maintain full compliance with Taiwan’s environmental, safety, health and fire protection regulations. TSMC developed a supplier’s code of conduct, which affirmed basic labor rights and standards for health, safety, environment, ethics and management systems. TSMC works with suppliers to evaluate the risk and impact on the economy, the environment, and society and to make continuous improvement. The Company has helped boost suppliers’ performance of sustainability through experience sharing and training and hopes to establish a world-class semiconductor supply chain that exceeds international standards and serves as a global benchmark.TSMC is subject to the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure rule on conflict minerals released under Rule 13p-1 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a recognized global leader in the high-tech supply chain, the Company acknowledges its corporate social responsibility to ensure procurement of conflict-free minerals in an effort to recognize humanitarian and ethical social principles that protect the dignity of all people. To this end, TSMC has implemented a series of compliance safeguards in accordance with leading industry practices such as adopting the due diligence framework in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)’s Model Supply Chain Policy for a Responsible Global Supply Chain of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High Risk Areas, issued in 2011.TSMC is a strong supporter of the RBA and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI). As a member of RBA, TSMC requires suppliers source conflict-free minerals through their jointly developed Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). Since 2011, TSMC has asked its suppliers to disclose and make timely updates on smelters information. The Company encourages suppliers to source minerals from facilities or smelters that have received a “conformant” designation by a recognized industry group (such as the RMI) and also requires those who have not received such designation to become compliant with RMI or an equivalent third-party audit program. TSMC requires the use of conflict-free tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold in its products. TSMC will continue to conduct the supplier survey annually and require suppliers to improve and expand their disclosure to fulfill regulatory and customer requirements.

The Foundation joins forces with several educational institutes and media outlets to tap into great potential of the younger generation.For the eighth TSMC Udreamer, themed “sowing a seed of dreams,” the Foundation held a special exhibition that combined the dream-building journey of popular science writer Rui-Ming Wang (Fat Fat Tree) and organized events such as a guided ecological tour of the Botanical Garden, lectures and fairs as a way to inspire the younger generation to pursue their dreams. More than 5,000 person-times participated in this series of events reaching a historical high. In addition the Foundation launched the TSMC Udreamer mentorship program whereby 15 TSMC employees joined the mentorship effort to accompany competition teams along their nine-month journey of a dream-building project through professional training workshops and regular experience sharing to help the students be connected with the society and fully realize their potential through a multi-dimensional educational philosophy and design.For artistic education to take root in children at an early age, the Foundation teamed up with the Sun Yun-Suan Foundation and the Mandarin Daily News to organize the first TSMC Penmanship Competition, thereby encouraging students to understand the beautiful lines embedded in Chinese characters by utilizing tools found in everyday life and to further enhance their own sense of beauty. The first competition was well-received and drew 4,824 entries. In addition to the Penmanship Competition, the Foundation continued to further develop the art of Chinese calligraphy and seal-carving. The 16th TSMC Youth Calligraphy and Seal-Carving Competition drew its inspiration from calligraphic characters seen in everyday life on billboards and signboards in the streets, urging the public to observe and appreciate Taiwan’s unique signboards in Chinese characters. The Foundation invited (formerly Madame Curie) science camp as a way to cultivate domestic talent in fundamental science. The TSMC Female Scientists Tour, on the other hand, focused on kindling female high school seniors’ passion for science. Each year, young women from 12 senior high schools in Taiwan are invited to visit science museums, participate in science workshops and attend talks by female scientists, who can encourage female students to keep on exploring the STEM fields by relating their own education and work experience.Work in Tandem with Educational Partners, Realize Quality EducationThe TSMC Education and Culture Foundation works in tandem with public and private educational institutions – schools, NGOs and state-funded arts and educational institutes – to pool available resources and focus on the real needs of the society so as to reach those who need but have no accessible resources and allow quality education to be realized in every corner of Taiwan.In 2021 the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation launched a five-year Teaching & Learning Project, in partnership with CommonWealth Magazine Education Foundation and Prof. Hwawei Ko Reading Research Center of National Tsing Hua University. The project aims to improve the measurement and evaluation of learning effectiveness through empowering teachers, to enhance teachers’ literacy teaching capacity through technological integration, and to assist teachers in teaching reading comprehension. As the project reached its third year, the teaching plan was adjusted in accordance with actual practice so that the project would better fit the teachers’ needs. In doing so, the Teaching & Learning Project gradually transformed from a one-way resource into a two-way communication activity and therefore provided more solid support for school teachers in rural areas. So far 127 teachers and 1,341 students have participated in the project. The Foundation also continued its collaboration with Junyi Academy to develop and promote online courses that cater to the real needs of teachers and students in rural areas and narrowing the gap of available sources between the urban and rural areas. The Foundation also funded scholarships and sponsored free laptops for 101 outstanding students from disadvantaged backgrounds at five national universities: National Central University, National Tsing Hua University, National Chung Cheng University, National Cheng Kung University, and National Sun Yat-sen University so that students from disadvantaged backgrounds can be free of financial worries and focus on their academic performance.two artists, Jun-Lin Ye and Liang-Zhi Ke, for a face-to-face conversation to share their knowledge of font design and calligraphy. The two artists also discussed the information embedded in and aestheticism conveyed through the Chinese characters on signboards. Their talks addressed the essence and beauty of the art of Chinese characters, increasing the public’s knowledge of and interest in the arts of calligraphy and seal-carving.The TSMC Youth Literature Award, co-organized by TSMC Education and Culture Foundation and the United Daily, celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2023 and received 13,752 entries. As part of the celebration, the Foundation also held three special literary events: Online Book Exhibitions of Past Award Winners, Risingsun Awards, and Documentary of Portraits of TSMC Youth Literary Writers. The Risingsun Awards grants its award to the most representative works of fiction, essays and contemporary poems as selected by a panel of judges of writers, Wen-Yin Zhong, Yu-Hui Liao and Wen-Wei Xu, from the published works of former TSMC Youth Literature Award winners and upcoming literary stars, which included 22 novels, 15 essays and 17 contemporary poems. The final Risingsun Awards were granted to the tenth award winner Zhen-Fu Xu, the first award winner Jie-An Chen, and the third award winner Zi-Xuan Zhuang. Judging from the list of the winners, it can be said that the literary seeds sown by the TSMC Youth Literature Award over the past 20 years are now growing into a flourishing garden of literature.Apart from the humanities, TSMC Education and Culture Foundation has long promoted popular science education, sponsoring a wide range of science competitions and camps. The Foundation continued its partnership with Center for the Advancement of Science Education of National Taiwan University to hold the TSMC Cup: Competition of Scientific Short Talk, which included two events: competition for expressing scientific innovation and essay awards on reading popular science books, which aim to encourage young students to read popular science books and watch related videos. The events hope to enhance students’ capacity to convey scientific knowledge through internalizing skills of analyzing and discussing science with dialectical logic. The competition for expressing scientific innovation, expanded its scope in 2023 and, as a result, not only did students in Taiwan enter the competition, but teams from as far as Malaysia also participated. More than 400 people took part in the two competitions. The Foundation has long funded the three major science camps for gifted students in Taiwan, Chien-Shiung Wu science camp, Ta-You Wu science camp and Marie Curie A three-way partnership with the Foundation, the National Symphony Orchestra (NSO), and Taipei National University of the Arts was launched and continued to promote the Music sans frontier Educational Project, which invited internationally-renown conductor Shao-Chia Lu and NSO’s music director Jun Markl to university campuses to broaden music students’ horizons. The initiative further arranged internships at the orchestra for the students enrolled in the class as a way to enrich their stage experience. The Foundation also carried on its collaboration with GuoGuang Opera Company to continue its three-year “on-campus project: Passing on Traditional Theatre Heritage,” starting from 2021. This project offers a year-long course at both National Tsing Hua University and Tunghai University for three years consecutively. The course contents included the knowledge of the theater, Peking Opera analysis and appreciation, Peking Opera performance demonstration, showcasing and combining theoretical knowledge and hands-on performance practices, guiding 115 number of students to learn about and experience the beauty of theater. A public performance is scheduled at the end of this 3-year project that showcases the course’s teaching and learning is scheduled to take place at the Main Theater of Taiwan Traditional Theatre Center in 2024. In 2023, TSMC Theater Lectures also broadened its scope. In addition to its partnership in passing on traditional theater with GuoGuang Opera Company, two other theater companies – Taiwan Kunju Opera Theatre and Hsing Legend Youth Theatre – came together to organize events specially designed for high school seniors in Hsinchu, Taichung and Tainan. 1,620 person-times participated in the events, which fostered the appreciation and understanding of traditional theater. In 2023, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation enhanced the contents of the TSMC Aesthetics Trip and the TSMC Science Trip from museum trips to in-depth educational courses. The trips still offer students guided tours to important permanent exhibitions at arts and science museums, but they now also offer lectures on art appreciation, hands-on workshops and science workshops with trained lecturers. The lectures guide primary students from rural areas to experience and learn in depth subjects on historical culture and artifacts, arts and aesthetics, architectural landscape and science. Finally, in order to assist junior high school students to appreciate the beauty of literature, the Foundation continued its partnership with Unitas literary magazine to organize the third TSMC Youth Literature Camp at the Emei Junior High School in Hsinchu. The Camp expanded to be an event lasting four days and three nights with the goal of improving literary education for junior high school students and guiding them to appreciate the 172173beauty of novels, essays, scripts and theater so that literature can take root in their lives.Supporting Arts and Culture Teams, Promoting Cultural CanonIn addition to providing continuous quality education, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation furthers dedicates itself to preserving traditional culture, funding long-term support for domestic and international performance teams, and promoting quality arts performances in local communities, thereby lifting the public’s spirits, promoting good and beauty in society.In 2023, the TSMC Hsinchu Arts Festival reached its twentieth anniversary and invited domestic and international artists to participate so they could give their talents full play to this year’s theme, Ode to Youth. Among the performances, Youthful Whispering, a piece of a dance theater, was choreographed by a youth-run theater company from Hsinchu Plan B Theatre. Fifteen rising stars, selected from roughly 100 who auditioned, were trained intensively over the course of four months. The performers’ youthful vivacity and physical rhythm exhibited explosive theatrical energy at their performance at the Moat Park in Hsinchu city and received loud applause and shouts of Bravo! from the 3,000 person-times strong audience from the local community. As part of the effort to promote exquisite performances, there were two other programs: the xiangsheng (traditional Chinese comic dialogues) Qu, Blooming into 30-Year Brilliance, performed by both second and third generation xiangsheng artists. The fact that the piece is taught hands-on to the third generation of young xiangsheng artists such as Ming-Han Song and Yin-Xie Wu by the second generation xiangsheng artists such as De-Gang Zhu, Guang-Yao Fan, and Yi-Jun Ye at the 30-year-old Taipei Qu Company is particularly meaningful as the process embodies the act of passing on tradition. The popular Berliner Barock Solisten, founded by leading members of the Berliner Philharmoniker, together with Yu-Chien Tseng, the prize-winning violinist of the international Tchaikovsky Competition, brought to the audience world-class performances of classical music. The 2023 TSMC Hsinchu Arts Festival organized 47 exquisite performances and exhibitions throughout, attended by over 52,000 person-times community members.In addition to fine performances and exhibitions, the Foundation also funds radio programs, helping the public appreciate the beauty of theater and literature.

From 2022, the Foundation focused on rural students’ employability. In 2023, the Foundation worked with six city governments to organize job fairs for senior high and vocational high school students, with career exploration and job placement designed as the main highlights. The aim was to focus resources on these two issues to help students identify certain targets early on and discover even more diverse career options, which eventually benefited more than 12,000 participants. In helping rural students obtain the skills to work locally, four enterprises, IKEA, LDC Hotels & Resorts Group, Howard Resort Xitou Hotel, and Panasonic Taiwan Co., Ltd., joined in 2023 to give training to seven senior vocational high schools and extended job offers to 68 students. The Foundation also spread the acknowledgement of vocational education by organizing a junior high school vocational expo and parent-child career workshops, as well as collaborating with 104 JOB BANK to promote the Road to Employment Program, inviting 104 professionals to appear on film and share their career stories. A dedicated website was also built to showcase these stories, encouraging students to use them as a reference in choosing their career paths.The Foundation assisted 31,133 students from rural areas in 2023. TSMC volunteers used their professional knowledge to develop science popularization AI lesson plans with ideas generated by ChatGPT, which were later modularized and promoted to 35 science education activities by the Foundation, benefiting a total of 1,093 children.The Foundation’s Sending Love platform initiative visited and screened disadvantaged individuals in need of financial support and also provided financial assistance and daily necessities made possible by internal and external donations from TSMC to improve the living conditions of highly vulnerable and disadvantaged families. As of 2023, the Foundation had supported a total of 295 families.●Taking Care of the Elderly The Foundation collaborates with Network of Compassion partners to enhance the health and welfare of solitary elders by connecting them with social welfare groups and medical Opera Company and Prof. Shih-Lung Lo at the Department of Chinese Literature of National Tsing Hua University, introduced the public to fine and elegant theater through analyzing texts and the history of theater and interviewing theater maestros. This program was nominated for the Best Host of Arts and Culture at the 58th Golden Bell Awards. On another front, Yi-Yun Xin, a master in classic Chinese literature who has been presenting a radio lecture on Chinese classics on Sound of IC radio station since 2008, presented a new program in 2023, Yi-Yun Xin on Chinses Fu Verse, focusing on Chinese classical Fu verse and sharing the beauty of classic literature with the audience 1.62 million person-times tuned in to listen to the two programs: Stories of Peking Opera and Yi-Yun Xin on Chinese Classical Fu Verse.As a way to enrich university campuses with arts and culture, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation organizes the annual TSMC Lectures series at the end of each year. The lectures series invites renowned scholars in the humanities to introduce the public and college students to the richness of literature, history and philosophy. In 2023, the series specifically invited Yu-Shan Wu, academician at and founder of Institute of Political Science at Academia Sinica, to discuss Russia-Ukraine War. By analyzing the historical roots and the power dynamics between large and small countries, academician Wu offered a systematic analysis of this international war and what can be learned from it. Nearly a thousand community members attended the lectures.7.4 TSMC Charity FoundationEstablished in 2017 and led by its chairperson Sophie Chang, the TSMC Charity Foundation (the Foundation) focuses on empowering communities in rural and suburban areas in three ways: education empowerment, taking care of the elderly, and protecting the environment. Internally, the Foundation calls on TSMC volunteers’ onsite/online services to address social inequalities and leverages its industrial network advantages to strengthen cooperation with local governments, enterprises and universities externally. Both the Foundation and the TSMC volunteers were committed to providing educational, medical and social welfare resources to children in rural schools or disadvantaged educational institutions, as well as to their families who were in urgent need of financial support, to help cultivate long-term career capabilities and improve their quality of life independently. The Foundation continued to operate the Sending Love platform to strengthen the cooperation among enterprises, local governments and universities so as to strengthen local services and jointly uplift society.units. In 2022, the Foundation cooperated with National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University and Guandau Hospital to establish a smart exercise club for the elderly, and introduce the TSMC volunteer services to prevent disability and delay aging through exercise. In 2023, the Foundation launched the adaptability assessment system for TSMC volunteers.

Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets  Goodwill  Goodwill is not amortized and instead is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the cash generating unit may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company’s cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the difference is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to such cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the cash generating unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the cash generating unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.  Tangible assets, right-of-use assets and other intangible assets  At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets (property, plant and equipment), right-of-use assets and other intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.  Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.  If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.  When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. The performance obligations are satisfied when customers obtain control of the promised goods, which is generally when the goods are delivered to the customers’ specified locations.  Revenue from sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. Estimated sales returns and other allowances is generally made and adjusted based on historical experience and the consideration of varying contractual terms to recognize refund liabilities, which is classified under accrued expenses and other current liabilities.  - 24 -   - 25 - In principle, payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 15-30 days from the end of the month of when the invoice is issued. Due to the short term nature of the receivables from sale of goods with the immaterial discounted effect, the Company measures them at the original invoice amounts without discounting.  Employee Benefits  Short-term employee benefits  Liabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for service rendered by employees.  Retirement benefits  For defined contribution retirement benefit plans, payments to the benefit plan are recognized as an expense when the employees have rendered service entitling them to the contribution. For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing benefit is recognized based on actuarial calculations.   Defined benefit costs (including service cost, net interest and remeasurement) under the defined benefit retirement benefit plans are determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Service cost (including current service cost), and net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) are recognized as employee benefits expense in the period they occur. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss.   Net defined benefit liability represents the actual deficit in the Company’s defined benefit plan.  Treasury Stock   Treasury stock represents the outstanding shares that the Company buys back from market, which is stated at cost and shown as a deduction in shareholders’ equity. When the Company retires treasury stock, the treasury stock account is reduced and the common stock as well as the capital surplus - additional paid-in capital are reversed on a pro rata basis. When the book value of the treasury stock exceeds the sum of the par value and additional paid-in capital, the difference is charged to capital surplus - treasury stock transactions and to retained earnings for any remaining amount.   Share-based payment arrangements  a. Equity-settled share-based payment arrangements  Restricted shares for employees are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the fair value at the grant date and the Company’s best estimate of the number expected to ultimately vest, with a corresponding increase in other equity - unearned employee benefits.  When restricted shares for employees are issued, other equity - unearned employee benefits is recognized on the grant date, with a corresponding increase in capital surplus - restricted shares for employees. Dividends paid to employees on restricted shares which do not need to be returned if employees resign in the vesting period are recognized as expenses upon the dividend declaration with a corresponding adjustment in retained earnings.  At the end of each reporting period, the Company revises its estimate of the number of restricted shares for employees that are expected to vest. The impact from such revision is recognized in profit or loss so that the cumulative expenses reflect the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to capital surplus - restricted shares for employees.  - 25 -   - 26 -  b. Cash-settled share-based payment arrangements  For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognized for the services acquired, measured at the fair value of the liability incurred. At the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.  Taxation  Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.  Current tax  Income tax on unappropriated earnings (excluding earnings from foreign consolidated subsidiaries) is expensed in the year the shareholders approved the appropriation of earnings which is the year subsequent to the year the earnings are generated.  Adjustments of prior years’ tax liabilities are added to or deducted from the current year’s tax provision.  Deferred tax  Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits for research and development expenses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.   Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.  The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered. The deferred tax assets which originally not recognized is also reviewed at the end of each reporting period and recognized to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.  Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year in which the liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.  Current and deferred tax for the year  Current and deferred tax are recognized in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.    - 26 -   - 27 - Government Grants  Government grants are not recognized until there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.  Government grants whose primary condition is that the Company should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire noncurrent assets (mainly including land use right and depreciable assets) are recognized as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related assets and recognized as a reduced depreciation or amortization charge in profit or loss over the contract period or useful lives of the related assets. Government grants that are receivables as compensation for expenses already incurred are deducted from incurred expenses in the period in which they become receivables.    5. MATERIAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION AND UNCERTAINTY  In the application of the aforementioned Company’s accounting policies, the Company is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.  Material Accounting Judgments  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue when the conditions described in Note 4 are satisfied.  Commencement of Depreciation Related to Property, Plant and Equipment Classified as Equipment under Installation and Construction in Progress (EUI/CIP)  As described in Note 4, commencement of depreciation related to EUI/CIP involves determining when the assets are available for their intended use. The criteria the Company uses to determine whether EUI/CIP are available for their intended use involves subjective judgments and assumptions about the conditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner.  Judgments on Lease Terms   In determining a lease term, the Company considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or not to exercise an option, including any expected changes in facts and circumstances from the commencement date until the exercise date of the option. Main factors considered include contractual terms and conditions covered by the optional periods, and the importance of the underlying asset to the lessee’s operations, etc. The lease term is reassessed if a significant change in circumstances that are within the control of the Company occurs.  Key Sources of Estimation and Uncertainty  Estimation of Sales Returns and Allowances  Sales returns and other allowance is estimated and recorded based on historical experience and in consideration of different contractual terms. The amount is deducted from revenue in the same period the related revenue is recorded. The Company periodically reviews the reasonableness of the estimates.  - 27 -   - 28 - Valuation of Inventory  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the Company uses estimate to determine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of each reporting period.  The Company estimates the net realizable value of inventory for normal waste, obsolescence and unmarketable items at the end of reporting period and then writes down the cost of inventories to net realizable value. The net realizable value of the inventory is determined mainly based on assumptions of future demand within a specific time horizon.  Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets Other than Goodwill  In the process of evaluating the potential impairment of tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill, the Company determines the independent cash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue and expenses related to the specific asset groups with the consideration of the nature of semiconductor industry. Any change in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in significant impairment charges or reversal in future years.  Realization of Deferred Income Tax Assets  Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those deferred tax assets can be utilized. Assessment of the realization of the deferred tax assets requires subjective judgment and estimate, including the future revenue growth and profitability, tax holidays, the amount of tax credits can be utilized and feasible tax planning strategies. Any changes in the global economic environment, the industry trends and relevant laws and regulations could result in significant adjustments to the deferred tax assets.  Determination of Lessees’ Incremental Borrowing Rates  In determining a lessee’s incremental borrowing rate used in discounting lease payments, the Company mainly takes into account the market risk-free rates, the estimated lessee’s credit spreads and secured status in a similar economic environment.    6.

The hedge ratio is adjusted in response to the changes in the financial market and capped at 100%.  On the basis of economic relationships, the value of the interest rate futures contracts and the value of the hedged financial assets change in opposite directions in response to movements in interest rates.  The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is the credit risk of the hedged financial assets, which is not reflected in the fair value of the interest rate futures contracts. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships during the hedging period. Amount of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in profit or loss is classified under other gains and losses, net.  The following tables summarize the information relating to the hedges of interest rate risks.

The hedge ratio is adjusted in response to the changes in the financial market and capped at 100%. The forward contracts have maturities of 12 months or less.  On the basis of economic relationships, the Company expects that the value of forward contracts and the value of hedged transactions will change in opposite directions in response to movements in foreign exchange rates or interest rates.  The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is driven by the effect of the counterparty’s own credit risk on the fair value of forward contracts. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships during the hedging period. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, refer to Note 20(d) for gain or loss arising from changes in the fair value of hedging instruments, the amount transferred to initial carrying amount of hedged items and the amount reclassified to finance costs of hedged items.    - 32 -   - 33 - The effect for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is detailed below:  Hedging Instruments/Hedged Items  Change in Value Used for Calculating Hedge Ineffectiveness   Years Ended December 31   2023  2022      Hedging Instruments     Forward exchange contracts (capital expenditures)    $ 39,898    $ - Forward interest rate contracts (issuance of debts)    $ -    $ 1,379,119      Hedged Items       Forecast transaction (capital expenditures)    $ (39,898)    $ - Forecast transaction (issuance of debts)    $ -    $ (1,379,119)  Hedges of net investments in foreign operations  TSMC has designated the bank loans denominated in foreign currency as a hedge of net investments in foreign operations to manage its foreign currency risk arising from investment in overseas subsidiaries.  The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is driven by the material difference between the notional amount of bank loans denominated in foreign currency and the net investment in foreign operations. No other sources of ineffectiveness have emerged from these hedging relationships during the hedging period. For the year ended December 31, 2023, refer to Note 20 (d) for gain or loss arising from changes in the fair value of hedging instruments.

These accounts receivable are classified as at FVTOCI because they are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.  In principle, the payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 15-30 days from the end of the month when the invoice is issued. Aside from recognizing impairment loss for credit-impaired accounts receivable, the Company recognizes loss allowance based on the expected credit loss ratio of customers by different risk levels with consideration of factors of historical loss ratios and customers’ financial conditions, competitiveness and business outlook. For accounts receivable past due over 90 days without collaterals or guarantees, the Company recognizes loss allowance at full amount.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS  a. Defined contribution plans  The plan under the R.O.C. Labor Pension Act (the “Act”) is deemed a defined contribution plan. Pursuant to the Act, TSMC and VisEra Tech have made monthly contributions equal to 6% of each employee’s monthly salary to employees’ pension accounts. Furthermore, TSMC North America, TSMC Europe, TSMC Japan, TSMC JDC, TSMC 3DIC, TSMC China, TSMC Nanjing, TSMC Arizona, JASM, TSMC Technology and TSMC Canada also make monthly contributions at certain percentages of the basic salary of their employees. Accordingly, the Company recognized expenses of NT$5,365,458 thousand and NT$4,550,387 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  b. Defined benefit plans  TSMC has defined benefit plans under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law that provide benefits based on an employee’s length of service and average monthly salary for the six-month period prior to retirement. The Company contributes an amount equal to 2% of salaries paid each month to their respective pension funds (the Funds), which are administered by the Labor Pension Fund Supervisory Committee (the Committee) and deposited in the Committee’s name in the Bank of Taiwan. Before the end of each year, the Company assesses the balance in the Funds. If the amount of the balance in the Funds is inadequate to pay retirement benefits for employees who conform to retirement requirements in the next year, the Company is required to fund the difference in one appropriation that should be made before the end of March of the next year. The Funds are operated and managed by the government’s designated authorities; as such, the Company does not have any right to intervene in the investments of the Funds.  Amounts recognized in respect of these defined benefit plans were as follows:    Years Ended December 31   2023  2022      Current service cost    $ 139,101    $ 134,376 Net interest expense     142,291     74,265 Components of defined benefit costs recognized in profit or loss     281,392     208,641 Remeasurement on the net defined benefit liability:     Return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest expense)     (16,252)     (429,948) Actuarial loss arising from experience adjustments     68,342     1,413,760 Actuarial (gain) loss arising from changes in financial assumptions     571,266     (160,752) Components of defined benefit costs recognized in other comprehensive income     623,356     823,060      Total    $ 904,748    $ 1,031,701  The pension costs of the aforementioned defined benefit plans were recognized in profit or loss by the following categories:   Years Ended December 31   2023  2022      Cost of revenue    $ 182,333    $ 135,125 Research and development expenses     76,120     55,632 General and administrative expenses     19,248     15,129 Marketing expenses     3,691     2,755              $ 281,392    $ 208,641   - 45 -   - 46 - The amounts arising from the defined benefit obligation of the Company were as follows:    December 31, 2023  December 31, 2022      Present value of defined benefit obligation    $ 17,995,066    $ 17,483,951 Fair value of plan assets     (8,737,842)     (8,162,860)      Net defined benefit liability    $ 9,257,224    $ 9,321,091  Movements in the present value of the defined benefit obligation were as follows:    Years Ended December 31   2023  2022      Balance, beginning of year    $ 17,483,951    $ 16,585,442 Current service cost     139,101     134,376 Interest expense     303,970     120,791 Remeasurement:           Actuarial loss arising from experience adjustments     68,342     1,413,760 Actuarial (gain) loss arising from changes in financial assumptions     571,266     (160,752) Benefits paid from plan assets      (556,455)     (585,343) Benefits paid directly by the Company     (15,109)     (24,323)      Balance, end of year    $ 17,995,066    $ 17,483,951  Movements in the fair value of the plan assets were as follows:    Years Ended December 31   2023  2022      Balance, beginning of year    $ 8,162,860    $ 5,548,563 Interest income     161,679     46,526 Remeasurement:     Return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest expense)     16,252     429,948 Contributions from employer     953,506     2,723,166 Benefits paid from plan assets     (556,455)     (585,343)      Balance, end of year    $ 8,737,842    $ 8,162,860  The fair value of the plan assets by major categories at the end of reporting period was as follows:    December 31, 2023  December 31, 2022      Cash    $ 1,351,744    $ 1,337,893 Equity instruments     4,998,919     4,696,909 Debt instruments     2,387,179     2,128,058              $ 8,737,842    $ 8,162,860    - 46 -   - 47 - The actuarial valuations of the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out by qualified actuaries. The principal assumptions of the actuarial valuation were as follows:    Measurement Date   December 31, 2023  December 31, 2022      Discount rate  1.40%  1.80% Future salary increase rate  4.00%  4.00%  Through the defined benefit plans under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law, the Company is exposed to the following risks:  1) Investment risk: The pension funds are invested in equity and debt securities, bank deposits, etc. The investment is conducted at the discretion of the government’s designated authorities or under the mandated management. However, under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law, the rate of return on assets shall not be less than the average interest rate on a two-year time deposit published by the local banks and the government is responsible for any shortfall in the event that the rate of return is less than the required rate of return.  2) Interest risk: A decrease in the government bond interest rate will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the debt investments of the plan assets.  Assuming a hypothetical decrease in interest rate at the end of the reporting period contributed to a decrease of 0.5% (and not below 0.0%) in the discount rate and all other assumptions were held constant, the present value of the defined benefit obligation would increase by NT$757,663 thousand and NT$766,692 thousand as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  3) Salary risk: The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation.  Assuming the expected salary rate increases by 0.5% at the end of the reporting period and all other assumptions were held constant, the present value of the defined benefit obligation would increase by NT$735,167 thousand and NT$746,933 thousand as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.   Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability.  The Company expects to make contributions of NT$991,646 thousand to the defined benefit plans in the next year starting from December 31, 2023. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 8 years.     - 47 -   - 48 - 20. EQUITY  a.

Retained earnings and dividend policy  TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation provide that, earnings distribution may be made on a quarterly basis after the close of each quarter. Distribution of earnings by way of cash dividends should be approved by TSMC’s Board of Directors and reported to TSMC’s shareholders in its meeting. When allocating earnings, TSMC shall first estimate and reserve the taxes to be paid, offset its losses, set aside a legal capital reserve at 10% of the remaining earnings (until the accumulated legal capital reserve equals TSMC’s paid-in capital), then set aside a special capital reserve in accordance with relevant laws or regulations or as requested by the authorities in charge. Any balance left over shall be allocated according to relevant laws and TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation.  TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation also provide that profits of TSMC may be distributed by way of cash dividend and/or stock dividend. However, distribution of earnings shall be made preferably by way of cash dividend. Distribution of earnings may also be made by way of stock dividend, provided that the ratio for stock dividend shall not exceed 50% of the total distribution.  The legal capital reserve may be used to offset a deficit, or be distributed as dividends in cash or stocks for the portion in excess of 25% of the paid-in capital if the Company incurs no loss.  Pursuant to existing regulations, the Company is required to set aside an additional special capital reserve equivalent to the net debit balance of the other components of stockholders’ equity, such as the accumulated balance of the foreign currency translation reserve, the effectiveness of hedges of net investments in foreign operations, unrealized valuation gain or loss from fair value through other comprehensive income financial assets, gain or loss from changes in fair value of hedging instruments in cash flow hedges, etc. For the subsequent decrease in the deduction amount to stockholders’ equity, any special reserve appropriated may be reversed to the extent that the net debit balance reverses.
