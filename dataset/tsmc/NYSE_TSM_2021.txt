128129that it will not be susceptible to new and emerging risks and attacks in the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats.Malicious hackers may also try to introduce computer viruses, corrupted software or ransomware into TSMC’s network systems to disrupt its operations, blackmail it to regain control of its computing systems, or spy on it for sensitive information. These attacks may result in TSMC having to pay damages for its delayed or disrupted orders or incur significant expense in implementing remedial and improvement measures to further enhance its cybersecurity network, and may also expose the Company to significant legal liabilities arising from or related to legal proceedings or regulatory investigations associated with such breaches.In the past, TSMC experienced and may in the future be subject to attacks by malicious software contained in the equipment the Company purchases and installs. TSMC has implemented and continually updates rigorous cybersecurity measures to prevent and minimize harm caused by such attacks. Such measures include advanced virus scanning tools to prevent a fab from installing virus-infected software, strengthening firewall and network controls to prevent computer viruses from spreading among tools and fabs, the installation of anti-virus and advanced malware detection solutions across Company computer devices, and enhancement of data center security through faster patch cycle times. In addition, TSMC has deployed secure PCs and laptops, developed a public cloud security policy with monitoring, defined and regularly reviewed the security key performance indicators (KPI), introduced new technology for data protection, and improved email phishing detection and regularly performed employee awareness testing. TSMC also established an integrated and automatic security operation platform, enhanced the automation of cybersecurity event detection and response, enhanced internal assessment automation, practiced the response to ransomware attacks and conducted external security risk assessments. In addition, to reduce supply chain risks, through collaboration, TSMC helped major suppliers improve their security maturity with KPI monitoring and share with them industry security events and best practices on demand and by schedule. Moreover, TSMC led the SEMI standard taskforce to formulate and release information security standards for semiconductor equipment (SEMI E187) to help improve the resilience of semiconductor supply chain. While these ongoing enhancements further improve Company’s cybersecurity defense solutions, there can be no assurance that the Company is immune to cyberattacks.In addition, TSMC employs certain third-party service providers for itself and its affiliates worldwide with whom it needs to share highly sensitive and confidential information to enable them to provide the relevant services. Despite requiring the third-party service providers to strictly fulfill the confidentiality and/or internet security requirements in its service agreements with them, there is no assurance that each of them will comply with such obligations. Moreover, such third-party service providers may also be susceptible to cyberattacks. If TSMC or its service providers are not able to timely resolve the respective technical difficulties caused by such cyberattacks, or ensure the integrity and availability of its data (and data belonging to its customers and other third parties) or maintain control of its or its service providers’ computing systems, the Company’s commitments to its customers and other stakeholders may be materially impaired and its results of operations, financial condition, prospects and reputation may also be materially and adversely affected.Risks Associated with Decrease in Demand and Average Selling PriceA vast majority of the Company’s revenue is derived from customers who use TSMC products in smartphones, high performance computing (HPC), Internet of Things (IoT), automotive, and digital consumer electronics (DCE). Any deterioration in or a slowdown in the growth of such end markets resulting in a substantial decrease in the demand for overall global semiconductor foundry services, including TSMC products and services, could adversely affect the Company’s revenue. Further, semiconductor manufacturing facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed-cost assets once they are in operation. Because the Company owns most of its manufacturing capacities, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. In general, these costs do not decline when customer demand or our capacity utilization rates drop, and thus declines in customer demand, among other factors, may significantly decrease our margins. Conversely, as product demand rises and factory utilization increases, the fixed costs are spread over increased output, which can improve our margins. In addition, the historical trend of declining average selling prices (or “ASP”) of end use applications places downward pressure on the prices of the components that go into such applications. Decreases in the ASP of end use applications may increase pricing pressure on components produced by TSMC, which, in turn, may negatively impact its revenue, margin and earnings.Risks Associated with CompetitionThe markets for TSMC’s foundry services are highly competitive. The Company competes with other foundry service providers, as well as a number of integrated device manufacturers. Some of these companies may have access to more advanced technologies than TSMC. Other companies may have greater financial and other resources than TSMC, such as the possibility of receiving direct or indirect government subsidies, economic stimulus funds, or other incentives that may be unavailable to TSMC. For example, Chinese companies are expected to be key players for new semiconductor fab development and fab equipment spending in part due to various incentives provided by the Chinese government. The governments of Europe, the United States, South Korea, and Japan also have incentive programs to incentivize developments of their domestic semiconductor industries. Although governments in certain of the countries or regions where TSMC is currently expanding or planning to expand its production capacity have extended or may in the future extend certain financial incentives to the Company, there is no assurance that TSMC will be able to apply for or receive such financial incentives at the levels TSMC expects or at all. Additionally, any financial incentives the Company receive may be subject to strict conditions, or the grantors could seek to recover any funds provided to TSMC, or cancel, reduce or deny our requests subsidies or grants in the future. This could materially increase TSMC’s operating costs and adversely affect its results of operations.Furthermore, the Company’s competitors may, from time to time, also decide to undertake aggressive pricing initiatives in one or several technology nodes. These competitive activities may decrease TSMC’s customer base or its ASP, or both. If TSMC is unable to compete effectively with such new and aggressive competitors on technology, manufacturing capacity, product quality and customer satisfaction, it risks losing customers to such new contenders.Risks Associated with Changes in the Government Policies and Regulatory EnvironmentTSMC management closely monitors all domestic and foreign governmental policies and regulations that might impact TSMC’s business and financial operations. In 2021 and as of the date of this Annual Report, there were no governmental policies or regulatory changes would materially impact TSMC’s operations or financial condition.6.3.3 Operational RisksRisks Associated with Capacity ExpansionTSMC performs long-term market demand forecasting for its products and services to manage its overall capacity. Based on its market demand forecasts, the Company has continued to add capacity to meet market needs for its products and services, including in Taiwan, in Nanjing, China, in Arizona, U.S., and in Kumamoto, Japan.Implementing these capacity expansion plans will increase its costs, and the increases may be substantial. For example, the Company would need to build new facilities, purchase additional equipment and hire and train personnel to operate the new equipment. If TSMC does not increase its net revenue accordingly, its financial performance may be adversely affected by these increased costs.In addition, market conditions are dynamic and TSMC’s market demand forecast may change significantly at any time. During periods of decreased demand, certain manufacturing lines or tools in some of the Company’s manufacturing facilities may be suspended or shut down temporarily. However, if demand subsequently increases rapidly over a short period of time, TSMC may not be able to restore the capacity in a timely manner to take advantage of the upturn. In such circumstances, its financial performance and competitiveness may be adversely affected.In order to mitigate the risk associated with capacity expansion, TSMC continuously watches for changes in market conditions and works closely with its customers. When market demand is not as expected, the Company tries to adjust its capacity plans in a timely manner to reduce the impact on its financial performance.Risks Associated with Construction of New FabsThe Company has multiple expansion projects that are currently underway, including the design and construction of new fabs worldwide. Labor shortages, interruptions in the supply chains for various building materials, and construction issues could substantially delay the completion of our expansion projects. Any prolongation of such delays could result in us incurring substantial additional costs or failing to meet our capacity expansion plans. In addition, future expansions of its operations in the R.O.C. could be limited by the limited availability of commercial-use land.Risks Associated with Sales ConcentrationOver the years, the profile of the Company’s customers and the nature of the Company’s customers’ business have changed dramatically. While TSMC generates revenue from hundreds of customers worldwide, TSMC’s ten largest customers in 2019, 2020 and 2021 accounted for approximately, 71%, 74% and 71% of TSMC’s net revenue in the respective year. TSMC’s largest customer in 2019, 2020 and 2021 accounted for 23%, 25% and 26% of the Company’s net revenue in the respective year. TSMC’s second largest customer in 2019, 2020 and 2021 accounted for 14%, 12% and 10% of TSMC’s net revenue in the respective year.130131A more concentrated customer base will subject TSMC’s revenue to seasonal demand fluctuations from the Company’s large customers, and cause different seasonal patterns in the Company’s business. This customer concentration results in part from the changing dynamics of the electronics industry with the structural shift to mobile devices and applications and software that provide the content for such devices.There are only a limited number of customers who are successfully exploiting this new business model paradigm. Also, TSMC has seen the changes of nature in its customers’ business models in response to this new business model paradigm. For example, there is a growing trend toward the system companies developing their own designed semiconductors and working directly with semiconductor foundries which makes their products and services more marketable in a changing consumer market.Also, since the global semiconductor industry is becoming increasingly competitive, some of TSMC’s customers have engaged in industry consolidations in order to remain competitive. Such consolidations have taken the form of mergers and acquisitions. If more of TSMC’s major customers consolidate, this will further decrease the overall number of the Company’s customer pool. In addition, regulatory restrictions, such as export control directed at TSMC’s major customers, could impact the Company’s ability to supply products to those customers, reduce those customers’ demand for TSMC’s products and services and impact their business operations.The loss of, or significant curtailment of purchases by, one or more of the Company’s top customers, including curtailments due to increased competitive pressures, heightened regulatory scrutiny, industry consolidation, changes in applicable regulatory restrictions, product designs, manufacturing sourcing or outsourcing policies or practices of these customers, or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments, or changes in its major customers’ business models, may adversely affect TSMC’s results of operations and financial condition.Risks Associated with Purchasing Concentration●Raw MaterialsTSMC’s production operations require that it obtain adequate supplies of raw materials, such as silicon wafers, gases, chemicals, and photoresist, on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices. In the past, shortages in the supply of some materials, whether by specific vendors or by the semiconductor industry generally, have resulted in occasional industry-wide price adjustments and delivery delays. Moreover, major natural disasters, trade barriers and political or economic turmoil, including military conflicts and inflation occurring within the country of origin of such raw materials may also significantly disrupt the availability of such raw materials or increase their prices. Also, since TSMC procures some of its raw materials from sole-sourced suppliers, there is a risk that the Company’s needs for such raw materials may not be met or that back-up supplies may not be readily available. Importation and domestic production limitations may also limit our ability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials as well as materials of the necessary quality. In addition, recent trade tensions could result in increased prices or even unavailability of raw materials due to tariffs, export control or other non-tariff barriers. TSMC’s revenue and earnings could decline if it is unable to obtain adequate supplies of the necessary raw materials in a timely manner or if there are significant increases in the costs of raw materials. To reduce the supply chain risk and to manage the cost effectively, TSMC commits resources toward developing new supply sources. Further, the Company continually encourages its suppliers to reduce their supply chain risk by decentralizing production plants and to improve their cost competitiveness by moving their production facilities to Taiwan from higher-cost areas.Given that qualified backup suppliers are hard to find, TSMC engages early and extensively with primary suppliers on managing quality and capacity issues so as to be prepared for any unexpected need to ramp up or curtail production when the Company lacks sufficient time to re-tune its production process. For leading technology nodes, TSMC not only adopts world-class processes and facilities but also requires world-class materials. To streamline supply chain risk, the Company has increased supplier site audits and meetings to extend supply chain best practices to its upstream suppliers. In addition, in response to the rapid increase or decrease in production capacity of new products, TSMC has continued to improve its inventory monitoring system to achieve more accurate demand forecasts and ensure that the supply chain maintains sufficient inventory levels. The Company has established a supply chain risk assessment to ensure that critical suppliers meet various standards in labor, ethics, ESH (environmental, safety and health) and BCP (business continuity plan). Onsite audits are conducted regularly to encourage suppliers to take responsibility for their supply chain, as any regulatory violations or adverse environmental impact event, or failure to meet sustainability requirements could result in business reduction or termination.●EquipmentThe Company’s operations and ongoing expansion plans depend on its ability to obtain an appropriate amount of equipment and related services from a limited number of suppliers in a market that is characterized from time to time by limited supply and long delivery cycles. During such times, supplier-specific or industry-wide lead times for delivery can be longer than previously expected and the cost of ownership may intrinsically increase. To better manage its supply chain, the Company has implemented various collaborative business models and risk management contingencies with suppliers to ensure supply and shorten the procurement lead times. However, if TSMC is unable to timely acquire the equipment and parts needed, the Company may fail to successfully implement its capacity expansion plans and exploit time sensitive business opportunities. Additionally, ongoing trade tensions or protectionist measures could result in increased prices for, or even unavailability of, key equipment, including as a result of necessary export licenses being delayed or denied, additional export control measures, and other tariff or non-tariff barriers. If TSMC is unable to obtain equipment in a timely manner to fulfill its customers’ demand on technology and production capacity, or at a reasonable cost, its financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.Risks Associated with Intellectual Property RightsThe Company’s ability to compete successfully and to achieve future growth depends in part on the continued strength of its intellectual property portfolio. While the Company actively enforces and protects our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that its efforts will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation or improper use of its proprietary technologies, patents, software, trade secrets or know-how. Also, the Company cannot assure you that, as its business or business models expand into new areas, it will be able to develop independently the technologies, patents, software, trade secrets or know-how necessary to conduct its business or that it can do so without unknowingly infringing the intellectual property rights of others. As a result, the Company may have to rely on, to a certain degree, licensed technologies and patent licenses from others. To the extent that the Company relies on licenses from others, there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain any or all of the necessary licenses in the future on terms it considers reasonable or at all. The lack of necessary licenses could expose the Company to claims for damages and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by its customers in instances where it has contractually agreed to indemnify its customers against damages resulting from infringement claims.The Company has received, from time to time, communications from third parties, including non-practicing entities and semiconductor companies, asserting that TSMC’s technologies, its manufacturing processes, or the design IPs of the semiconductors made by TSMC or the use of those semiconductors by its customers may infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. Because of the nature of the industry, its market position, and the expansion of its manufacturing operations outside of Taiwan, the Company may receive an increased number of such communications in the future. The assertions made and lawsuits initiated by litigious, well-funded, non-practicing entities are particularly aggressive in their monetary demand and in seeking court-issued injunctions. Such lawsuits and assertions may increase TSMC’s cost of doing business and may potentially be extremely disruptive if these asserting entities succeed in blocking the trade of products made and services offered by TSMC. Also, with the expansion of its manufacturing operations into certain non-R.O.C jurisdictions, it has faced increased challenges in managing risks of intellectual property misappropriation. Despite our efforts to adopt robust measures to mitigate the risk of intellectual property misappropriation in such new jurisdictions, we cannot guarantee that the protection measures we adopted will be sufficient to prevent us from potential infringements by others, or at all.If the Company fails to obtain or maintain certain technologies or intellectual property licenses or fails to prevent our intellectual property from being misappropriated and, if litigation relating to alleged intellectual property matters occurs, it could: (1) prevent the Company from manufacturing particular products or selling particular services or applying particular technologies; and (2) reduce our ability to compete effectively against entities benefiting from our misappropriated intellectual property, which could reduce its opportunities to generate revenue.The Company has taken related measures to minimize potential loss of shareholder value arising from intellectual property claims and litigation filed against it. These measures include: strategically obtaining licenses from certain semiconductor and other technology companies as needed; timely securing intellectual property rights originating within and outside of TSMC for defensive and/or offensive protection of TSMC technology and business; and aggressively defending against baseless litigation.Risks Associated with Litigious and Non-litigious MattersAs is the case with many companies in the semiconductor industry, the Company has received from time to time communications from third parties asserting that its technologies, its manufacturing processes, or the design of the semiconductors made by TSMC or the use of those semiconductors by its customers may infringe upon their patents or other intellectual property rights. These assertions 132133have at times resulted in litigation by or against the Company and settlement payments by the Company. Irrespective of the validity of these claims, the Company could incur significant costs in the defense thereof or could suffer adverse effects on its operations. The Company is also subject to antitrust compliance requirements and scrutiny by governmental regulators in multiple jurisdictions. Any adverse results of such proceeding or other similar proceedings that may arise in those jurisdictions could harm TSMC’s business and distract its management, and thereby have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or prospects, and subject the Company to potential significant legal liability.In 2021 and as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC is not currently a party to any material legal proceedings.Risks Associated with Mergers and AcquisitionsIn 2021 and as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC had not conducted any merger or acquisition.Risks Associated with Recruiting Quality PersonnelTSMC relies on the continued service and contribution of its management team, skilled technical and professional personnel. The Company’s business could suffer from the inability to fulfill personnel needs with high quality professionals in a timely fashion caused by the loss of personnel, illegal talent poaching, immigration controls, or related changes in market demand for its products and services. Since there is fierce competition for talent recruitment, the Company cannot ensure timely fulfillment of its personnel demand.In order to reduce the risk of talent recruitment challenges, TSMC encourages job rotation and employs an on-the-job training and certification system. In this way, employees can learn and enhance their work efficiency and effectiveness in the actual workplace. Moreover, TSMC creates multiple recruitment channels and continues to hire various top-notch, talented professionals from Taiwan and overseas. At the same time, the Company continues to expand industry-academic cooperation to meet outstanding talented individuals at an early Phase in order to recruit them in the future.Future R&D Plans and Expected R&D SpendingFor additional details, see “5.2.7 Future R&D Plans” on pages 95-96 of this Annual Report.Changes in Corporate Reputation and Impact on Company’s Crisis ManagementTSMC has established an excellent reputation based on its core values of integrity, commitment, innovation and customer trust. The Company’s positive image also reflects outstanding operations, rigorous corporate governance and dedication to social responsibility by serving as a good corporate citizen. TSMC continues to pursue innovation in the economic, environmental and social dimensions.In 2021, TSMC was honored with numerous awards for achievements in operations, corporate governance, patents, profit growth, investor relations, environmental protection, corporate sustainability and other fields. These included: the inaugural Terra Carta Seal Award launched by HRH The Prince of Wales’ Sustainable Markets Initiative; the Taiwan Institute for Sustainable Energy 2021 Taiwan Corporate Sustainability Awards’ Most Prestigious Sustainability Award – Top Ten Domestic Corporates, Best Sustainability Report Award, Cyclical Economy Leadership Award, Supply Chain Leadership Award, and Information Security Leadership Award; First Place in CommonWealth Magazine’s Excellence in Corporate Social Responsibility Award for Large-Cap companies; ranked top 5% in the Taiwan Stock Exchange corporate governance evaluation; member of Fortune Magazine’s 2021 World’s Most Admired Companies and the 2021 Global 500; the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic Affairs Industrial Development Bureau’s Energy Conservation Benchmark Award; the R.O.C. Environmental Protection Administration’s Enterprise Green Procurement Award; membership in the Corporate Knights 100 Most Sustainable Corporations for 2021; membership in the 2021 Carbon Clean 200 list by Corporate Knights and As You Sow; and membership in the Time Magazine 100 Most Influential Companies. In addition, TSMC was selected as a part of the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for the 21st consecutive year.As TSMC strives to excel in corporate social responsibility, the Company also encourages employees to make innovative breakthroughs in how they think about things and do things, as well as nurture their empathy and broaden their horizons. In 2021, the ESG Steering Committee, led by Chairman Dr. Mark Liu, held the second “TSMC ESG AWARD,” taking tangible action to encourage all employees to propose ideas for sustainability in the five ESG strategic directions, including green manufacturing, building a responsible supply chain, creating a diverse & inclusive workplace, talent development, and caring for the disadvantaged. The award further motivates TSMC colleagues to think innovatively about their work and implement corporate social responsibility. Compared with 785 sustainability proposals in the first year, the second annual ESG Award received 1,257 innovative ideas, adding new energy to the Company’s culture of sustainability.With its global reputation in mind, TSMC employs numerous preventative measures to address potential risks from earthquakes, fires, IT service disruption, yield loss, information security, supply chain disruption, pandemics, environmental events, and utility supply disruption. TSMC sets crisis response and recovery measures according to possible crisis events and maintains a “TSMC crisis command center control instruction“ as well as a “TSMC emergency response procedure“ to establish its emergency response command structure. TSMC also performs regular exercises for crisis scenarios to ensure that crisis response procedures are comprehensive. In 2021, TSMC received a rating of “low risk” from the Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating.TSMC holds monthly meetings of the Environment, Safety and Health Committee, which coordinates relevant departments in each fab to conduct regular emergency response drills and continuously improve their notification and operational procedures to ensure clear channels of communication to stakeholders in crisis management, with the public relations department serving as the designated gateway for external communications.In the event of an emergency, all departments immediately deploy emergency response measures to eliminate or minimize impact on personnel safety, the surrounding environment, company property and manufacturing operations. Responders also alert the public relations department at the earliest stages of response to ensure timely, clear and consistent communication regarding the situation.Risks Associated with Change in ManagementIn 2021 and as of the date of this Annual Report, there were no such risks for TSMC.6.3.4 Financial RisksEconomic RisksAny future systemic political, economic or financial crisis or market volatility, including but not limited to interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, inflation or deflation and changes in economic, fiscal and monetary policies in major economies, could cause revenue or profits for the semiconductor industry as a whole to decline dramatically, and if the economic conditions or financial conditions of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, the demand for its products and services may decrease and additional accounting related allowances may be required, which could reduce our operating income and net income.●Interest Rate FluctuationTSMC is exposed to interest rate risks primarily in relation to its investment portfolio and outstanding debt. Changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and fixed income securities, the fair value of those securities, as well as the interest paid on its debt.The objective of TSMC’s investment policy is to achieve a return that will allow the Company to preserve principal and support liquidity requirements. The policy generally requires the Company to invest in investment grade securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. TSMC’s cash and cash equivalents, as well as fixed income investments in both fixed- and floating-rate securities, carry a degree of interest rate risk. The majority of TSMC’s fixed income investments are fixed-rate securities, which are classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, and may have their fair value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates. At the same time, if interest rates fall, cash and cash equivalents as well as floating-rate securities may generate less interest income than expected.TSMC has entered and may in the future enter into interest rate derivatives to partially hedge interest rate risk on its fixed income investments and anticipated debt issuance. However, these hedges can offset only a limited portion of the financial impact from movements in interest rates.All of the Company’s short-term debt is floating-rate, hence a rise in interest rates may result in higher interest expense than expected. The majority of its long-term debt is fixed-rate and measured at amortized cost and, as such, changes in interest rates would not affect future cash flows or the carrying amount.Certain of TSMC’s fixed income investments are primarily based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which will be replaced by alternative benchmark rates after June 30, 2023. The transition from LIBOR to alternative benchmark rates might result in a reduction in TSMC’s interest income.●Foreign Exchange VolatilitySubstantially all of TSMC’s sales are denominated in U.S. dollars and over half of its capital expenditures are denominated in currencies other than the NT dollar, primarily in U.S. dollars, Euros and Japanese yen. As a result, any significant fluctuations to its disadvantage in the exchange rate of the NT dollar against such currencies, in particular a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar, would have an adverse impact on the Company’s revenue and operating profit as expressed in NT 134135dollars. For example, every one percent depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the NT dollar would result in an approximately 0.4 percentage point decrease in the Company’s operating margin based on its 2021 results.Conversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates significantly versus other major currencies, the demand for the products and services of TSMC’s customers and for its goods and services will likely decrease, which will negatively affect the Company’s revenue.TSMC uses foreign currency derivative contracts, such as currency forwards or currency swaps, to protect against currency exchange rate risks associated with non-NT-dollar-denominated assets and liabilities and certain forecasted transactions. These hedges reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements on its assets and liabilities.Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the NT dollar may affect the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s common shares and the market price of the Company’s American Depositary Shares (ADSs) as well as any cash dividends paid in NT dollar on TSMC’s common shares represented by ADSs.●InflationIf inflation continues running higher, the Federal Reserve would take tightening monetary policy which could result in higher interest rates, adversely affecting the fair value of TSMC's fixed income investments and causing higher interest expenses of future debt issuance. In order to control the interest rate risk, TSMC closely monitors the market development and monetary policy. TSMC has entered – and may in the future enter – into interest rate derivatives to partially hedge the interest rate risk on its fixed income investments and anticipated debt issuance.●Amendments to Tax Regulations or Implementation of New Tax LawsAny amendments to existing tax regulations or the implementation of any new tax laws in the jurisdictions in which TSMC operates its business may have an adverse effect on its net income.While the Company is subject to tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which it operates or conducts business, TSMC’s principal operations are in the R.O.C. and it is exposed primarily to taxes levied by the R.O.C. government. Any unfavorable changes of tax laws and regulations in this jurisdiction could increase TSMC’s effective tax rate and have an adverse effect on its operating results. Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project that was undertaken by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). These changes may increase tax uncertainty and have an adverse effect on TSMC’s operating results.In order to control tax risk, the Company closely monitors all domestic and foreign governmental policies and regulations that might impact its financial operations. TSMC has established risk management procedures to collect information, analyze potential tax implications, and develop countermeasures.Risks Associated with External FinancingIn times of market instability, sufficient external financing may not be available to the Company on a timely basis, or on commercially reasonable terms to the Company, or at all. If sufficient external financing is not available when TSMC needs such financing to meet its capital requirements, the Company may be forced to curtail its expansion, modify plans or delay the deployment of new or expanded services until it obtains such financing.Risks Associated with High-Risk/Highly Leveraged Investments; Lending, Endorsements, and Guarantees for Other Parties; and Financial Derivative TransactionsIn 2021 and as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC made no high-risk or highly leveraged financial investments. All financial derivative transactions engaged by TSMC were strictly for hedging and not for trading or speculative purposes. All guarantees and intercompany loans provided by TSMC and TSMC’s subsidiaries were solely for TSMC and/or TSMC’s wholly-owned subsidiaries. All guarantees and intercompany loans were in compliance with relevant rules and regulations.To manage risks of various financial transactions, TSMC has established internal control policies and procedures based on sound financial and business practices, all in compliance with the relevant rules and regulations issued by the R.O.C. Financial Supervisory Commission. TSMC’s policies and procedures include “Procedures for Financial Derivatives Transactions,” “Procedures for Lending Funds to Other Parties,” “Procedures for Acquisition or Disposal of Assets,” and “Procedures for Endorsement and Guarantee.”Risks Associated with Impairment ChargesUnder Taiwan-IFRSs, TSMC is required to evaluate its tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. If certain criteria are met, TSMC is required to record an impairment charge. TSMC is not able to estimate the extent or timing of any impairment charge for future years. Any impairment charge required may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s net income.The determination of an impairment charge at any given time is mainly based on the projected results of operations over several years subsequent to that time. Consequently, an impairment charge is more likely to occur during a period when the Company’s operating results are otherwise already depressed. See “Note 5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION AND UNCERTAINTY” in Annual Report section (II), Financial Statements for a discussion of how TSMC assesses if an impairment charge is required and, if so, how the amount is determined.6.3.5 Hazardous RisksThe frequency and severity of disruptive events, including damaging earthquakes, other natural disasters and extreme weather, have been increasing in part due to climate change or systemic regional geological changes. TSMC has manufacturing and other operations, and is expanding its production capacity, in locations that may experience natural disasters, such as flooding, earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, and droughts that may cause interruptions or shortages in the supply of utilities, such as water and electricity, which in turn could disrupt operations. In addition, TSMC’s suppliers and customers also have operations in such locations. For example, most of TSMC’s production facilities, as well as those of many of its suppliers and customers and upstream providers of complementary semiconductor manufacturing services, are located in Taiwan and Japan, areas susceptible to earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding, typhoons, and droughts from time to time that may cause shortages of electricity or water, or interruptions to TSMC’s operations.Thus, if one or more natural disasters result in a prolonged disruption to TSMC’s operations or those of its customers or suppliers, or if any of its fabs or vendor facilities were to be damaged or cease operations as a result of an explosion or fire, it could reduce the TSMC’s manufacturing capacity and cause the loss of important customers and thereby have an adverse, material impact on its operational and financial performance.In 2021, Taiwan faced one of the worst droughts in decades. To cope with such severe weather events, the government placed restrictions on the supply and usage of water by industrial companies such as TSMC, which could also disrupt TSMC’s operations. In response, TSMC implemented its business continuity plans, including water conservation measures, the use of more secured water sources, water supplied by tank cars, stress tests and various exercises. As a result, there was no material impact to TSMC’s business or operational performance.TSMC has occasionally suffered power outages or surges in Taiwan caused by difficulties encountered by its electricity supplier, the Taiwan Power Company, or other power consumers on the same power grid. Some of these have resulted in interruptions to our operations. Such shortages or interruptions in electricity supply could further be exacerbated by changes in the energy policy of the government, which intends to make Taiwan a nuclear-free country by 2025. If the TSMC is unable to secure reliable and uninterrupted supply of electricity to power its manufacturing fabs within Taiwan, its ability to fill customers’ orders would be severely jeopardized.If such events were to occur over prolonged periods of time, TSMC’s operations and financial performance may be materially adversely affected.TSMC’s future capacity expansions in the R.O.C. and elsewhere could be curtailed by shortages in water and electricity.The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may materially adversely affect TSMC’s business and results of operations in several ways, including but not limited to: (1) interruption of the operations of TSMC’s supply chains for equipment, parts and materials in terms of manufacturing, logistics, and manpower arrangements for tool installation; (2) significant fluctuation in TSMC customers’ demands for certain products, leading to uncertainties for TSMC’s capacity planning and also for meeting customer demand, which may harm TSMC’s business with its customers and subject TSMC to the risk of legal disputes; and (3) potential production delays for TSMC’s products due to forced factory or office closures or partial operation.TSMC has formed an “Epidemic Prevention Committee” to identify, implement and monitor actions stemming from the dynamic exigencies of the pandemic, including but not limited to, health management of TSMC’s employees, splitting operation and work from home arrangements, identification and control of high risk individuals, rapid investigation of confirmed cases, management of production inventory, supply chain management, and capacity management for demand changes. In 2021 and as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC’s current business and results of operations have not been materially affected by the pandemic. However, there is no certainty that the measures TSMC has taken will be sufficient 136137to mitigate further risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and TSMC’s ability to perform critical functions and to meet customers’ needs could be materially adversely affected as a result. In addition, there is also a risk that any post-pandemic downward changes in consumers’ demand for electronic products may, in turn, lead to reduced demand for and place downward pressure on the price of our products and services.TSMC maintains a comprehensive risk management system dedicated to human safety, the conservation of natural resources and the protection of property. In order to cope effectively with emergencies and natural disasters, management at each facility has developed comprehensive plans and procedures that focus on risk prevention, emergency response, crisis management and business continuity. All TSMC manufacturing fabs have been ISO 14001 certified (environmental management) and ISO 45001 certified (occupational health and safety management). All manufacturing fabs in Taiwan have also been TOSHMS (Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System) certified. New fabs will also attain the above certifications within 18 months after acquiring factory registration certification.TSMC has further strengthened its business continuity management, which includes periodic risk assessment, risk mitigation, and the establishment of emergency taskforces when necessary, combined with the preparation of a thorough analysis of an emergency, its impact, alternative actions, and solutions for each possible scenario together with appropriate precautionary and/or recovery measures. Each taskforce is given the responsibility of ensuring TSMC’s ability to minimize personal injury, business disruption and financial impact under the circumstances. TSMC periodically reviews its business continuity plans and revises them according to exercise results and implementation.In response to the impact of the earthquake that occurred in Taiwan, TSMC continued to improve its earthquake emergency response, tool anchorage and seismic isolation facilities, and readiness for tool salvage and production recovery. These improvements have also been integrated into new fab design. TSMC’s business continuity procedures were further enhanced through the compliance with ISO 22301.TSMC and many of its suppliers use flammable and toxic materials in their manufacturing processes and are therefore subject to risks that cannot be completely eliminated arising from explosion, fire, or environmental influences. Although TSMC maintains multiple layers of risk prevention and protection, as well as fire and casualty insurance, TSMC’s risk management and insurance coverage may not always be sufficient to cover all of its potential losses. If any of TSMC’s fabs or vendor facilities were to be damaged or cease operations as a result of an explosion, fire or environmental causes, it could reduce the TSMC’s manufacturing capacity leading to the loss of important sales and customers and have a negative impact on TSMC’s financial performance. In addition to periodic fire-protection inspections and firefighting drills, TSMC has also carried out a corporate-wide fire risk mitigation project focused on managerial and hardware improvements.6.3.6  Risks Regarding Non-Compliance with Export Control, Environmental and Climate Change Related Laws, Regulations and Accords, and Failure to Timely Obtain Requisite Approvals Necessary for Conducting BusinessBecause TSMC engages in manufacturing activities in multiple jurisdictions and conducts business with its customers located worldwide, such activities are subject to a myriad of governmental regulations. For example, the manufacturing, assembling and testing of TSMC’s products require the use of metals, chemicals, and materials that are subject to environmental, climate-related, health and safety, and humanitarian conflict-free sourcing laws, regulations and guidelines issued worldwide.The Company’s failure to comply with any such laws or regulations, as amended from time to time, or its failure to comply with any information or document sharing requests from the relevant authorities in a timely manner could result in:●significant penalties and legal liabilities, such as the denial of import or export permits, or third-party private lawsuits, criminal or administrative proceedings;●the temporary or permanent suspension of production of the affected products;●the temporary or permanent inability to procure or use certain production critical chemicals or materials;●unfavorable alterations in TSMC’s manufacturing, fabrication and assembly and test processes;●challenges from its customers that place TSMC at a significant competitive disadvantage, such as loss of actual or potential sales contracts in case the Company is unable to satisfy the applicable legal standard or customer requirement;●restrictions on TSMC’s operations or sales;●loss of tax benefits, including termination of current tax incentives, disqualification of tax credit application and repayment of the tax benefits that the Company are not entitled to; and●damages to TSMC’s goodwill and reputation.Complying with applicable laws and regulations, such as environmental and climate related laws and regulations, could also require TSMC, among other things, to do the following: (1) purchase, use or install remedial equipment; (2) implement remedial programs such as climate change mitigation programs; (3) modify its product designs and manufacturing processes, or incur other significant expenses such as obtaining renewable energy sources, renewable energy certificates or carbon credits, substitute raw materials or chemicals that may cost more or be less available for the Company’s operations.TSMC’s inability to timely obtain approvals necessary for the conduct of its business could impair its operational and financial results. For example, if the Company is unable to timely obtain environmental related approvals needed to undertake the development and construction of a new fab or expansion project, then such inability may delay, limit, or increase the cost of its expansion plans that could also in turn adversely affect its business and operational results. In light of increased public interest in environmental issues, TSMC’s operations and expansion plans may be adversely affected or delayed responding to public concern and social environmental pressures even if the Company complies with all applicable laws and regulations.TSMC believes that climate change should be regarded as a significant corporate risk that must be managed to improve competitiveness. For TSMC’s climate change related risks and control measures, see the “Climate Change and Energy Management“ section under “7.2.1 Environmental Protection“ on page 146-147 of this Annual Report.6.3.7 Other RisksPotential Impact and Risks Associated with Sales of Significant Numbers of Shares by TSMC’s Directors, and/or Shareholders Who Own 10% or More of TSMC’s Total Outstanding SharesThe value of TSMC shareholders’ investment may be reduced by possible future sales of TSMC shares owned by major shareholders.As of the date of this Annual Report, no single shareholder owned 10% or more of TSMC’s total outstanding shares.Risks of Trade PoliciesAs TSMC’s revenue is primarily derived from sales to customers in major global markets (please refer to “2.2.4 TSMC Position, Differentiation and Strategy” on page 14-16 of this annual report), any changes in the trade policies of major economic regions – such as the increase of tariffs on certain products, the implementation of import and export controls, or the adoption of other trade barriers – could affect  TSMC sales or those of its customers and thereby affect the Company’s operating results. TSMC continues to monitor the recent shifts in trade policies and measures among the relevant major economies and will take appropriate actions in accordance with subsequent developments.In May 2020 and again in August 2020, the U.S. tightened its export control measures against Huawei Technology Co. Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, “Huawei”), including an expanded license requirement for providing Huawei with items subject to the U.S. export control jurisdiction. To comply with relevant laws and regulations, we have discontinued shipment of products to Huawei since September 15, 2020. On the other hand, measures adopted by an affected country to counteract impacts of another country’s actions or regulations could lead to significant legal liability to multinational corporations including our own. For example, in January 2021, China adopted a blocking statute that, among other matters, entitles Chinese entities incurring damages from a multinational’s compliance with foreign laws to seek civil remedies. Additionally, in February 2022, several countries and regions began to impose various measures, including sanctions and export controls, against Russia, including certain individuals and entities, as a result of the military conflict in Ukraine. Imposition of trade barriers, including protectionist measures, sanctions and import and export controls, could increase our manufacturing costs, limit our access to certain supplies and make our pricing less competitive.In 2021 and as of the date of this annual report, our current results of operations have not been materially affected. Nevertheless, depending on future developments of global trade tensions, such relevant regulations, rules, or measures may have an adverse impact on our business and operations, and we may incur significant legal liability and financial losses as a result.TSMC continues to monitor the recent shifts in trade policies and measures among the relevant major economies and will take corresponding responsive actions in accordance with subsequent developments.Other Material RisksIn 2021 and as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC’s management was not aware of any other risk that could potentially have a material impact on the financial status of the Company.1381391381391401417.1 OverviewAs a global leader in the semiconductor industry, TSMC is dedicated to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. The Company collaborates with all stakeholders – employees, shareholders, customers, suppliers, government and society – to drive positive change for society by pursuing three primary missions: acting with integrity, strengthening environmental protection, and caring for the disadvantaged.Guidance for the Implementation of ESGIn keeping with its vision of Uplifting Society, TSMC’s ESG policy is the overarching guiding principle for sustainable development. The ESG Matrix, set by TSMC’s founder Dr. Morris Chang, clearly defines the scope of the Company’s ESG responsibility. The horizontal axis shows the seven areas where TSMC strives to demonstrate its ESG commitment: morality, business ethics, economy, rule of law, sustainability, work/life balance and happiness, and philanthropy. On the vertical axis are actions that TSMC has taken to fulfill these commitments.TSMC ESG MatrixSocietyTSMC MoralityBusiness EthicsEconomyRule of LawSustainabilityWork/Life Balance HappinessPhilanthropyIntegrity VVLaw Compliance VAnti-Corruption Anti-Bribery Anti-CronyismVVVEnvironmental Protection Climate Control Energy Conservation VVCorporate Governance VVVProvide Well-Paying Jobs VVGood Shareholder Return VEmployees’ Work-Life Balance VEncourage Innovation VVGood Work Environment VTSMC Charity Foundation VVVTSMC Education and Culture Foundation VVVESG ManagementThe ESG Steering Committee is committed to aligning TSMC closely with best practices in international sustainability. TSMC’s Chairman leads the Steering committee, while the Chairperson of the ESG committee serves as Executive Secretary, and senior executives from a wide variety of functions – all working together to set the short-, medium- and long-term ESG strategic directions that link to the UN’s sustainable development goals (SDGs).ESG Department coordinates quarterly meeting, on behalf of the ESG Committee that facilitates cross-divisional communication and issue-based discussions among cross-organizational teams, where committee members jointly set the Company’s ESG strategies and targets, identify key issues for the year, draft ESG-related budgets, coordinate resource deployment and carry out annual projects. The committee pursues sustainability in the interest of all stakeholders and ensures the strategies are implemented effectively in daily operations.The Board of Directors supervises the Company’s sustainability management, strategies, and goals as well as performance measurement. The ESG Committee Chairperson reports quarterly to the Board of Directors on the implementation of plans and results. In 2021, TSMC focused primarily on climate change strategy (including net zero emission, carbon footprint, and supply chain carbon emission management), human rights protection under the pandemic, maintaining a diverse and inclusive workplace, making sustainability disclosures and performing sustainable culture advocacy (i.e., TSMC ESG awards). At the same time, to attract and retain corporate executives and to link their compensation with shareholders’ interests and ESG achievements, the Board of Directors approved 2021 Employee Restricted Stock Awards Rules and the issuance of 2021 employee restricted stock awards (RSAs). The issuance of the RSAs was approved at the 2021 Annual Shareholders’ Meeting. The number of shares to be vested by corporate executives will be subject to a modifier to increase or decrease up to 10% based on the Compensation Committee’s evaluation of the Company’s ESG achievements.Stakeholder EngagementTSMC respects all stakeholders’ rights and interests in sustainability issues. The Company thus deploys multiple communication venues for stakeholders to express ESG opinions and concerns including the “Contact Us” section of the corporate website, the ESG website and the ESG mailbox, the Irregular Business Conduct Reporting System, as well as the Supply Chain Worker Grievance Channel. Through identification, prioritization and validation, TSMC manages and addresses stakeholders’ concerns.Stakeholders and Communication Channels in 2021StakeholdersCommunication

The TSMC Sustainability Report (formerly the Corporate Social Responsibility Report) discloses ESG material issues identified following the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards and aligned with stakeholders’ feedback. Integrating Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) with ESG management, TSMC demonstrates how the Company implements risk mitigation measures, addresses international & industry trends, and operates sustainably at TSMC Taiwan Facilities (headquarters, wafer fabs, back-end packaging fabs, and testing fabs located in Taiwan), TSMC China, TSMC Nanjing, WaferTech in the United States, VisEra and other subsidiaries. In addition to GRI, the report also adopts the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD Recommendations) framework, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) reporting standards, AA 1000 Accountability Principle and is assured by DNV GL Business Assurance Co. Ltd. in accordance with DNV VeriSustainTM protocol and GRI standards.The Company will continue to operate responsibly and with integrity regardless of future challenges. TSMC has adopted nine UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), set 2030 long-term goals, and implemented approaches accordingly. Anchored in the concept of Global Partnerships, SDG 17, TSMC collaborates with stakeholders as well as business partners of the value chain to create sustainable value for its stakeholders and is the only semiconductor company chosen for the Dow Jones Sustainability World Indices for the past 21 consecutive years.1441457.2  Environmental, Safety and Health (ESH) ManagementTSMC believes its environmental, safety and health practices must not only meet legal requirements but should also align with internationally recognized best practices. The Company’s ESH policies aim to achieve “zero incident” and “environmental sustainability” and to make TSMC a world-class organization in environmental, safety and health management. The Company’s strategies for attaining these goals are to comply with regulations, promote safety and health, strengthen recycling and pollution prevention, manage ESH risks, instill an ESH culture, establish a green supply chain, and fulfill its related corporate social responsibilities.All TSMC and its subsidiaries’ manufacturing facilities have received ISO 14001: 2015 certification for environmental management systems and ISO 45001: 2018 certification for occupational safety and health management systems. All fabs in Taiwan have been certified by TOSHMS (Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System). All the above certifications are maintained valid. New facilities are required to receive aforementioned certifications within 18 months after receiving facility license per TSMC’s internal policy.TSMC strives for continuous improvement and actively seeks to enhance climate-change management, pollution prevention and control, power and resource conservation, waste reduction and recycling, safety and health management, and fire and explosion prevention as well as to minimize the impact of earthquake damage, so as to reduce overall environmental, safety and health risks.In order to meet regulatory and customer requirements for the management of hazardous materials, TSMC has adopted the IECQ QC 080000 Hazardous Substance Process Management (HSPM) System. All TSMC Fabs have been QC 080000 certified and maintained valid since 2007.

NMP usage in process has been reduced 75% by 2021 comparing to 2016, and the project will continue promoting for further reduction.Since 2011, TSMC has adopted the ISO 50001 Energy Management System for continuous improvement in energy conservation. As of 2021, all TSMC and its subsidiaries’ manufacturing facilities had received ISO 50001 Energy Management System certification and maintained valid except for the WaferTech subsidiary in the U.S. WaferTech was originally scheduled to receive the certification in 2021 but certification was postponed to 2022 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.Aiming to establish the healthiest possible workplace, in 2017 TSMC formed a corporate-level health promotion committee led by managers at the vice president level, which will hold irregular meetings per occupational disease cases or certain needs. The committee members include site directors, managers of safety and health department, and representatives from wellness, HR and legal affairs divisions. External experts have also been invited to discuss the potential risks of occupational diseases in the semiconductor manufacturing process and prevention plans for such diseases. To mitigate health risks to employees, suppliers and contractors in the workplace, TSMC has adopted rigorous safety and health control measures focused on preventing occupational injuries and diseases and promoting employee safety, physical and mental health.To minimize the supply chain risk and fulfill corporate social responsibility, TSMC not only follows ESH best practices internally but also strives to improve the ESH performance of its suppliers and contractors through audits and counselling.TSMC uses priority work management and self-management to govern services provided by contractors. The Company requires contractors performing level-one high-risk operations to complete certification for technicians and to establish their own ISO 45001 safety and health management system. The emphasis on self-management nurtures the sense of responsibility, with the goal of promoting safety awareness and technical improvement for all contractors in the industry. For onsite contractor personnel, TSMC has standardized courses on safety and health and increased the frequency of such 146147courses to improve training effectiveness and safety awareness. To ensure the Company’s safety protocols are accurately delivered to contractors on a timely basis, TSMC has established a digital platform for mutual communication so that onsite operational risks can be mitigated.TSMC collaborates with suppliers to manage the sustainability of the supply chain, including formulating supplier sustainability standards, drawing up audit plans, performing audits and tracking improvements, coaching and training, and re-coaching for suppliers with poor performance. Coaching and training are key focuses in 2021, including the establishment of a fire protection designated personnel system (113 suppliers have established) and fire protection practice training (48 participants from 48 suppliers), inviting suppliers to participate as observers for TSMC’s annual emergency response drills for six consecutive years (131 participants from 131 suppliers for the cumulative number), environmental, safety and health sustainability forum and good cases sharing (298 participants from 201 suppliers), etc., to improve the performances of environmental protection, safety, health and fire protection. TSMC conducts environmental, safety and health audits to suppliers’ manufacturing sites, and actively assists suppliers to improve their environmental, safety and health performances. In addition, the Company requests that suppliers conduct carbon emissions inventory and encourages them to implement measures to save energy, reduce carbon emissions, conserve water and reduce waste.7.2.1 Environmental ProtectionClimate Change and Energy Management●Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)Given that climate change could potentially affect operations and pose financial risk, in 2018 TSMC adopted recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) released by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to identify risks and opportunities and further establish metrics and target management based on the results identified.Management Structure of TSMC Climate-related Risks and OpportunitiesCategoryManagement Strategy and Actions GovernanceBoard of Directors periodically reviews climate change related risks and opportunities●ESG Steering Committee led by the Chairman is the Company’s top organization dealing with climate change management. The Chairperson of ESG Committee serves as the Executive Secretary.

In 2021, TSMC declared the long-term goal of Net Zero Emissions by 2050, while setting the short-term goal of zero growth in emissions by 2025. By actively implementing emission reduction measures, the Company is working to return its carbon emissions to the 2020 level by 2030. TSMC commits to becoming a global leader in green manufacturing.TSMC actively participates in the initiatives of the World Semiconductor Council (WSC), and has incorporated its past experience to develop PFC (perfluorinated compounds) emissions reduction best practices, and fully adopted and implemented since 2012. In 2013, in accordance with the “EPA Early Actions for Carbon Credit of Greenhouse Gases Reduction” regulation, TSMC applied for the recognition of greenhouse gas reduction from 2005 to 2011, and received 5.28 million tons of carbon dioxide credits in 2015. Those carbon credits can be used to offset greenhouse gas emissions of new manufacturing facilities regulated by Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Act, which can support the Company’s sustainable operations and mitigate climate-change risk.148149Since 2005, TSMC has completed the GHG (Greenhouse Gas) inventory program and taken a complete inventory of its GHG emissions to gain ISO 14064 certification. The inventory shows that the major direct GHG emissions are PFCs, which are widely used in the semiconductor manufacturing process. The primary indirect GHG emission is electricity consumption. The analysis of the inventory data is not only to meet domestic regulatory reporting requirements but also to serve as a baseline reference for the Company’s strategy to reduce GHG emissions. Since 2005, TSMC has also participated the international organization Carbon Disclosure Program (CDP) to publicly disclose climate change related information for 17 consecutive years and to continuously review and improve management practices through it.In response to the commitment of global climate summit “Paris Agreement” and the Republic of China’s “Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act” promulgated in 2015, TSMC initiated a cross-functional platform for corporate carbon management in 2016. The three areas of focus of this platform are legal compliance, carbon emission reduction, and carbon credit acquisition. In addition to participating in official regulatory consultation and communications meetings, TSMC also sets short-, medium- and long-term reduction targets through the energy and carbon reduction committee led by the Fab Operations vice president. The measures are carried out by energy and carbon reduction teams of individual fabs. Because more than 75% of TSMC’s GHG emissions come from electricity consumption, the Company always emphasizes energy conservation and carbon reduction initiatives. TSMC has not only implemented energy-conserving designs in its manufacturing fabs and offices but has also continuously improved the energy efficiency of its facilities during operation. These efforts simultaneously reduce both carbon dioxide gas emissions and costs. As a result, TSMC has conserved 2.4 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of power since 2016.From 2015 to 2017, TSMC voluntarily participated in the R.O.C. Ministry of Economic Affairs’ green power purchasing program for three consecutive years and became the largest buyer in Taiwan, purchasing 400 million kilowatt hours (kWh) of green power. Although the Taiwan Power Company stopped selling green power in 2018, TSMC still aggressively negotiates the purchase of renewable energy with renewable energy suppliers in Taiwan. Targeting a long-term commitment of 100% renewable energy for the Company, TSMC has committed to achieving a target of 40% renewable energy by 2030. Since 2018, the overseas manufacturing fabs and offices have purchased renewable energy, REC and carbon credits to offset all carbon emissions caused by power consumption. All TSMC overseas sites achieved zero carbon emission of electricity consumption in 2021 again. TSMC also used carbon credits to offset carbon emissions of natural gas consumption in kitchens, achieving the milestone of net zero emissions for TSMC global offices. Although development of renewable energy in Taiwan is in an early stage, TSMC has established a renewable energy task force and continues to communicate closely with government through the Association of Science Park Industries and Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association. The Company has made recommendations to the government in the hope that the collaboration would speed up renewable energy development in Taiwan. The recommendations include expanding the development of offshore wind power and increasing the supply of the renewable energy trading platform. TSMC continues to find renewable energy. By the end of 2021, the total installation capacity of renewable energy contracted reached 1.6 GW (Gigawatts). The renewable energy will be provided to TSMC gradually after the related business process has been completed. This is a clear manifestation of the Company’s active support of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).In 2020 TSMC became the first semiconductor company to join RE100 (the global corporate renewable energy initiative) and pledged that power consumption of all the Company’s manufacturing plants and offices will be 100% supplied from renewable energy by 2050.TSMC GHG Emissions in Recent Two Years Unit: Metric ton CO2 equivalentYearScope 1 Scope 220212,591,2318,045,10220202,450,3547,459,856Note 1: GHG includes CO2, CH4, N2O, HCFCs, PFCs, SF6, NF3Note 2:  Scope 1:  Direct emissions, e.g., direct emission sources owned or controlled by the Company Scope 2:  Indirect emissions from energy, e.g., indirect GHG emissions caused by the externally purchased electricity, heat or steamNote 3:  The data in the table are preliminary results calculated by TSMC and have not yet been verified by a third party.TSMC GHG Reduction Target and Achievement StatusStrategy2030 Goal2021 Target and AchievementAchievement StatusContinue to use best available technology to reduce emissions of GHG and become an industry leader in low-carbon manufacturingReduce GHG emissions per unit product (metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e)/12-inch equivalent wafer mask layer) by 40% (Base year: 2010)Reduced GHG emissions per unit product (metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e)/12-inch equivalent wafer mask layer) by 23% (Target: 20%)AchievedAir and Water Pollution ControlThe Company has installed effective air and water pollution control equipment in each wafer fab to meet regulatory emissions standards. In addition, TSMC maintains backup pollution control systems, including emergency power supplies, to lower the risk of pollutant emissions in the event of equipment failure. The Company centrally monitors the operations of its air and water pollution control equipment monitored by 24 hours a day rotating staff and treats system effectiveness as an important tracking item to ensure the quality of emitted air and discharged water.To make the most effective use of Taiwan’s limited water resources, all TSMC fabs strive to increase water reclamation rates by adjusting the water usage of manufacturing equipment and improving wastewater reclamation systems. By 2021, TSMC’s unit product water consumption had decreased by 15% from 2010 levels. The long-term target is a 30% decrease by 2030. All fabs meet or exceed the process water reclamation rate standard of the Science Park Administration. Some fabs are able to reclaim more than 90% of process water, outperforming most semiconductor fabs around the world. The Company also makes every effort to reduce non-manufacturing-related water consumption, including water used in air conditioning systems, sanitary facilities, wall cleaning and landscaping activities and in kitchens. TSMC uses an intranet website to collect and measure water recycling volumes company-wide.Since water resources are inherently local, TSMC shares its water saving experience and expertise with other semiconductor companies through the Association of Science-Based Industrial Park to promote water conservation in order to achieve the Science Park’s goals and ensure a long-term balance of supply and demand. In addition, TSMC has committed to using partially reclaimed water in newly constructed fabs in the future in order to further reuse water resources and support government policy and promotion for reclaimed water.To further enhance water resources management, TSMC has adopted and followed the AWS Standard, the world’s only sustainable water management standard. Early in 2019, Fab 6 and Fab 14 Phase 5/6/7 began serving as demonstration factories and received AWS certification, making TSMC the first semiconductor enterprise in the world to receive AWS platinum level certification. In 2020, Fab 15A and Fab 15B, located in Central Taiwan Science Park, passed a third-party verification audit and obtained AWS platinum level certification simultaneously. In December 2021, Fab 12A, Fab 12B, Fab 5, located in Hsinchu Science Park, and Longtan Science Park Advanced Backend Fab 3 passed a third-party verification audit and will obtain AWS platinum level certification in early 2022.TSMC Water Usage in Recent Two YearsYearTotal Water Usage (m3)Unit Product Water Usage (L/12-inch wafer-e-layer)202182,674,982119.7202077,257,163128.4Note 1: Including TSMC fabs in Taiwan and Subsidiaries.Note 2:  The data in the table are preliminary results collected by TSMC and have not yet been verified by a third party.TSMC Water Usage Reduction Target and Achievement StatusStrategy2030 Goal2021 Target and AchievementAchievement StatusEnforce climate change mitigation policies, implement water conservation and water shortage adaptation measuresReduce unit water consumption (liter/12-inch equivalent wafer mask layer) by 30% (Base year: 2010)Reduced unit water consumption by 15% (Target: 9%)AchievedWaste Management and RecyclingTSMC has expanded its facilities rapidly in recent years both at home in Taiwan and overseas. In 2021 the Company’s total outsourced general waste was 335,080 tons; its hazardous waste was 339,623 tons; and its unit waste disposal was 0.99 kg/12-inch equivalent wafer mask layers. This compared to 277,340 tons of outside general waste, and 298,400 tons of 150151hazardous waste, and unit waste disposal of 1.01 kg/12-inch equivalent wafer mask layers in 2020, respectively.To achieve the goal of sustainable resource utilization, TSMC has a designated unit responsible for waste recycling and disposal. The priorities are process waste reduction, onsite and offsite recycling and regeneration, with the last options being incineration and landfill. In 2017, TSMC amended its articles of incorporation to add four business items for chemical materials to ensure waste flow and reduce risks of improper waste disposal by commissioned agencies. It also set up onsite resource activation facilities to convert waste resources produced by processing activities into products to be used onsite or to sell to other factories. In 2021, TSMC recycled waste copper sulfate, cobalt-containing liquid, waste sulfuric acid and waste ammonium sulfate, all of which were regenerated into products. The Company also developed the system of cryolite synthesis whereby waste HF (hydrogen fluoride) is recycled and regenerated into raw material for other industries. As a result, it has become a leader in waste resources regeneration. At the same time, TSMC’s fabs in Taiwan achieved a 95% waste recycling rate for the seventh consecutive year, with a landfill rate below 1% for the twelfth consecutive year, and Fab 12 won the platinum UL 2799 certification, the highest grade for zero landfill.TSMC Waste Quantity and Outsourced Unit Waste Disposal in Recent Two YearsYearOutsourced General Waste (ton) (Note 1)Outsourced Hazardous Waste (ton) (Note 1)Outsourced Unit Waste Disposal (Note 2)(kg/12-inch equivalent wafer mask layer)2021335,080339,6230.992020277,340298,4001.01Note 1:  The total quantity of outsourced waste includes Taiwan facilities and subsidiaries.Note 2: The data is Outsourced Unit Waste Disposal of Taiwan facilities.Note 3:  The data in the table are preliminary results collected by TSMC and have not yet been verified by a third party.TSMC Waste Reduction Target and Achievement StatusStrategy2030 Goal2021 Target and AchievementAchievement StatusPromote waste reduction by source separation and require vendors to provide low chemical consumption equipmentOutsourced unit waste disposal per wafer ≦0.50 (kg/12-inch equivalent wafer mask layer)Outsourced unit waste disposal per wafer 0.99 (kg/12-inch equivalent wafer mask layer) (Target: ≦1.15%)Exceeded2021 Environmental Cost of TSMC Fabs in TaiwanUnit: NT$ thousandsClassificationDescriptionExpenseInvestment1.

During this time, the Company also received five Taiwan Intelligent Building diamond-class certifications and 25 Taiwan EEWH (ecology, energy saving, waste reduction and health) certifications: 20 diamond, four gold and one silver. Since 2009, the Company has been a leading supporter of the Taiwan government’s Green Factory Label standard, including the Clean Production and Factory Green Building evaluation systems. TSMC received Taiwan’s first Green Factory Label and 13 labels in total as of the end of 2021, and is the most awarded company in Taiwan.Environmental Audit Results in Violation of Environmental RegulationsIn 2021 and as of the date of this Annual Report, TSMC has no incurred any environmental pollution related losses. However, the Company was given two fines totaling NT$127,000 for violating environmental regulations: NT$100,000 issued on 01/06/2021 for failing to take effective air pollutant control measures at our construction site (Section 2 of Article 23 of the Air Pollution Control Act) – the Company took immediate corrective action after the audit by the competent authority; NT$27,000 issued on 01/28/2021 for construction site work failing to conform with the Run-off Wastewater Reduction Plan approved by competent authority (Article In order to ensure that all waste is treated and recycled properly, TSMC closely tracks the waste that is implemented in the process of recycling and reuse by clean and disposal vendors. The Company carefully selects waste disposal and recycling vendors that have certificates and permits, regularly checks the onsite operational status, disposal declaration forms, operational records, etc., compares with actual reuse and disposal, and takes proactive steps to strengthen vendor auditing. For example, all waste transportation contractors have agreed to join the GPS Satellite Fleet so that the cleanup transportation routes and abnormal stays for all trucks can be traced. All waste recycling and disposal vendors have installed closed-circuit TV systems at operating sites to monitor and audit waste handling. In addition, TSMC also conducts an ongoing survey of recycled product tracking and requires all recycling contractors to report their recycled product sales monthly to track waste flow and ensure that actions are taken to adhere to lawful and proper waste recycling and treatment.Environmental AccountingThe purpose of TSMC’s environmental accounting system is to identify and quantify environmental costs for internal management. At the same time, the Company also evaluates the savings or economic benefits of environmental protection programs so as to continuously promote economically-effective programs. While environmental expenses are expected to continue to rise, environmental accounting can help manage these costs more effectively. TSMC’s environmental accounting measures various environmental costs, establishes independent environmental account codes, and provides the data to all units for use in annual budgeting. The Company’s economic benefit evaluation calculates cost savings for energy conservation, water or waste reductions and recycling benefits in accordance with its environmental protection programs. The benefits disclosed in this report include real income from projects such as waste recycling and savings from major environmental projects. In 2021, the total benefits of environmental protection programs of TSMC fabs including waste recycling exceeded NT$5,457 million.1521532.

Examples include early warning systems to minimize the injury from falls for the elderly, systems to detect physiological changes, car safety systems and other applications that significantly improve human health and safety. One noteworthy example in 2021: TSMC helped a customer deliver innovative DNA sequencing chips. These chips assisted researchers in quickly identifying variants of the COVID-19 virus, including the first Omicron, contributing significantly to the understanding and control of the pandemic. Moreover, advanced sensors can make equipment smarter by monitoring the working environment and conditions so that it can operate in a more energy efficient way.7.2.3 Safety and HealthSafety and Health ManagementTSMC’s safety and health management is compliant with local and international standards and adheres to the management approach of “Plan, Do, Check, Act” to prevent accidents, promote employee safety and health, and protect Company assets. All TSMC fabs in Taiwan have received TOSHMS (Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System) certification since 2009. In 2018, the International Organization for Standardization released ISO 45001: 2018, replacing OHSAS 18001, with major changes in the expansion of the scope, support and participation of the leadership, the collection and planning of internal and external issues, the expectations and demand of stakeholders, the evaluation of risk inspections, communication and consultation with non-managers, the application of performance indicators, and the evaluation of corrective and preventive actions. Meanwhile, ISO 45001 ensures the spirit of the system can be effectively implemented at the management level through management review, internal audit, automatic check, and security patrol to find safety concerns and opportunities for improvement. All fabs in Taiwan received ISO 45001 certification for occupational health and safety in 2019 and all TSMC subsidiaries obtained the certification in 2020. All the above certifications are maintained valid. New facilities are required to receive aforementioned certifications within 18 months after receiving facility license per TSMC’s internal policy.Besides accident prevention, TSMC has established emergency response procedures to protect employees and contractors if a disaster should occur, as well as to prevent and/or reduce the negative impact on the community and the environment. TSMC communicates regularly with suppliers to ensure that potential risk in the operation of production equipment is minimized and that safety control procedures are followed rigorously during installation. The Company places stringent controls on high-risk operations and also evaluates the seismic tolerance of its facilities and equipment to reduce the risk of earthquake damage.For epidemics, TSMC has established corporate-level prevention committees and procedures for emergency response to outbreaks of infectious diseases.Working Environment and Employee Safety and Health ProtectionThe Company’s ESH policy is focused on establishing a safe working environment, preventing occupational injury and illness, keeping employees healthy, enhancing every employee’s awareness and sense of accountability to ESH, and building an ESH culture.There were a total of 44 occupational injuries in 2021, with 44 people, representing approximately 0.08% of the total number of employees. The disabling injury frequency rate (FR) was 0.38, under the 0.4 target, but the disability injury severity rate (SR) was 7, in excess of the target of 4. In response, TSMC is reviewing potential improvement measures, such as interlocking devices for machine safety, as well as standard safety operation procedures. In addition to regular reviews, the caring program for employees has been enhanced and managers have been directed to pay closer attention to the physical and mental state of employees to ensure their safety and health during their work.TSMC safety and health management operations apply to the following:●Equipment Safety and Health ManagementIn addition to meeting regulatory requirements and internal standards, as well as mitigating ESH-related risks when building or expanding facilities, TSMC also maintains procedures governing new equipment and raw materials, requires safety approvals for bringing new tools online, updates safety rules, and implements seismic protection and other safety measures.TSMC requires that all new tools meet SEMI-S8 requirements and that appropriate supplementary control measures be taken to reduce ergonomic risk. Moreover, the Company endeavors to automate 300mm front-opening unified pod (FOUP) transportation to prevent accumulative physical damage caused by repetitive manual handling of 300mm FOUPs. TSMC 300mm fabs have converted to automatic transportation control.●Environmental, Safety and Health Evaluation of New Tools and New Chemical SubstancesAs a technology leader in the global semiconductor industry, TSMC operates increasingly diversified process tools and introduces new chemicals in the R&D stage. Before using new tools or new chemicals, they are reviewed carefully by the new tools and new chemical review committee. The purpose is to ensure that new tools are compliant with the semiconductor industry’s safety standards (such as SEMI-S2) and that new chemicals’ environmental, safety and health concerns can be well controlled, including engineering controls, application of personal protection equipment, and operational safety training during storage, transportation, usage and disposal. A total of 403 cases of new tools and chemical substances were passed by the New Tool and New Chemical Review Committee in 2021, and they were evaluated and reviewed in accordance with the aforementioned standards before entering TSMC.●General Safety Management, Training and AuditAll TSMC manufacturing facilities hold environmental, safety and health committee meetings on a monthly basis. TSMC has adopted multiple preventive measures such as controls on high-risk work, contractor management, chemical safety management, personal protective equipment requirements, and safety audit management. In addition, the Company maintains detailed disaster response procedures and performs regular drills designed to minimize damage to employees and property, as well as the impact on society and the environment in the event of a disaster.TSMC Safety-Related Training and Promotion in the Recent Two YearsYearTotal Number of Employees who have Completed Safety-related Training2021289,3982020244,747●Working Environment Hazardous Factors Management TSMC conducts workplace hazard assessments to provide a comfortable, safe workplace to employees. The Company also educates and requires employees to use personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent hazardous exposures.The Company performs semi-annual workplace environment assessments of physical and chemical hazards, including CO2 concentration, illumination, noise, and hazardous chemical substances regulated by local laws. In addition, TSMC performs exposure assessments and uses hierarchy management control for chemicals with potential health hazards. If abnormal measurements occur, events happen, or an exposure assessment indicates there is an adverse health effect on employees, ESH professionals immediately conduct onsite observation and intervention to reduce the exposure to acceptable levels.156157●Health Promotion ProgramIn order to establish the healthiest possible workplace and reduce the incidence of occupational disease, TSMC formed a corporate-level committee to carry out health promotion programs covering three key areas:1.  Exposure and health risk assessment: develop an exposure assessment system to identify high health risk employees.2.  Hazardous training and notification: use standardized training materials for employees and contractors in all TSMC fabs. Inform them of the health risks and prevention measures at the workplace before working or providing any services there.3.  Strengthen management of chemicals with significant health risks: inform suppliers that all materials they provide to TSMC must comply with applicable laws including clear disclosure of any hazardous substances. Perform sampling of raw materials used in the manufacturing process to confirm that they do not contain any carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic-reproductive materials as claimed in supplier’s safety data sheet (SDS).●Emergency ResponseThe planning and execution of an effective emergency response should identify potential high-risk events via risk assessment and be prepared for various scenarios. It should focus on continuous improvement and drills covering all potentially serious events. TSMC’s emergency response plans include procedures for rapid-response crisis management and disaster recovery for potential incidents.All TSMC fabs conduct major annual emergency response exercises and evacuation drills. TSMC’s onsite service contractors are also required to participate in emergency response planning and exercises to ensure cooperation in handling accidents and to effectively minimize any damage caused by disasters. At least every two years, each fab director invites fab management and support functions to participate in business continuity drills for potentially high-risk events such as earthquake, fire and flood (at the Tainan site). Since 2018, TSMC has conducted complex accident emergency response drills, which include simultaneous scenarios for earthquake, fire and chemical spills to ensure rapid response to emergencies so that losses can be minimized in the event of a real disaster. In 2020, TSMC took lead in the industry to introduce the All-Hazard approach recommended by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to conduct disaster prevention exercises.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, TSMC added tabletop exercises to disaster prevention training in an effort to minimize the risks of group infections that may arise as a result of full-scale exercises. The inclusion of tabletop exercises also aids in the verification of full-scale exercise procedures to make disaster response more comprehensive, thus effectively mitigating the impact of various types of disasters on business continuity in the future. As of 2021, 215 sessions of tabletop exercises had been completed in addition to 125 full-scale exercises.In addition to the regular emergency response drills held by engineering and facilities departments each quarter, the Company’s laboratory, canteen, dormitory, and shuttle bus personnel also hold emergency response drills to prepare for events such as earthquakes, chemical spills, ammonia release, fires and traffic accidents.●Emerging Infectious Disease ResponseTSMC has a dedicated corporate ESH organization to monitor emerging infectious diseases around the world, to assess any potential impact on the workplace, and to provide an appropriate strategic response plan. In previous outbreaks such as SARS in 2003, H1N1 influenza in 2009, and MERS in 2015, as well as with the current COVID-19 threat, TSMC followed the Taiwan CDC’s (Centers for Disease Control) rules and convened the corporate influenza response committee to develop the Company’s strategies. These strategies included educating employees in prevention and response, publishing guidelines for managers, establishing guidelines for employee sick leave due to flu, and installing alcohol-based hand sanitizers at appropriate locations. The Committee also monitors the status of employee leave due to illness and, at the same time, develops a continuity plan to address manpower shortages and minimize business impact. In order to protect the health of TSMC employees, their families, and work partners, employees are encouraged to be fully vaccinated if in healthy condition. In addition, employees should complete daily body temperature checks and update vaccination information before entering TSMC, and continue to follow epidemic prevention regulations such as wearing a mask, washing their hands frequently and maintaining safe social distancing.●Employee Physical and Mental Health EnhancementTSMC believes that employee physical and mental health is not only fundamental to maintaining sound business operations but is also an important part of a corporation’s responsibility. To preserve and promote the physical and mental health of its employees, TSMC fosters collaboration among the onsite industrial safety and environmental protection department, the onsite medical personnel of the health center, and physicians of occupational medicine. TSMC strives to reduce cerebral and cardiovascular conditions or injuries that might be induced or aggravated by overwork, night work or shift work. The Company conducts programs for maternal health protection and for prevention of cumulative trauma disorders as well. TSMC devotes significant resources to mental health awareness, focused not only on hazards at work but also on employee health in general. In 2021, through planned personal health management, (1) 550 female employees participated in the maternal health program, and the completion rate was 100%. All but one of them were at first degree risk, where there was no potential harm to the mother or infant. One woman was assessed as second degree risk, with potential harm to the mother or infant, but after proper adjustments to her work duties, her risk was downgraded to first degree. (2) Through analysis of historical cerebral and cardiovascular cases of its employees, TSMC has sharpened the disease assessment criteria used by contracted doctors, and, in combination with internal annual health examination reports and work scheduling information, the Company was able to identify 3,520 employees with middle to high risk for cerebral and cardiovascular diseases. These employees were provided with health education and medical assistance. Also, they and their managers received recommended changes in working hours and shifts to reduce health risks. (3) 168 employees were identified as high risk for cumulative trauma disorders, including one who might also have job-related risks, and the Company adjusted working conditions accordingly to reduce potential risks. (4) As obesity has been considered as a precursor to hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, TSMC has held health promotion programs for several consecutive years. In 2021, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and catering to the younger generation’s preference for social and video media, apart from physical weight loss activities (671 participants; total weight loss reached 3,155.82kg),TSMC conducted a series of online interactive activities including: three sessions of “Health Lecture Online” with 1,527 attendees in total; three health education videos about Weight-loss Diets/Sport and improving sleeping, with a total of 8,947 visits; three sessions of online quizzes on the same three topics of Weight-loss Diets/Sport and improving sleeping, with a total of 14,910 attendees; and two session of “Selection of Health Diet” of Low-sugar diets and 211 balanced diet, with 3,373 participants. In addition, one-on-one sleep counseling related to psychology has been increased in 2021, 220 attendees in total. The above activities have all received positive feedback from employees. In the future, we will continue to implement relevant health promotion activities to take care of the health of employees.7.2.4 Supplier ManagementManagement AspectFor better supply chain management, TSMC is committed to communicating with and encouraging its suppliers, including contractors, to increase their quality, cost effectiveness and delivery performance, and make continuous improvement in environmental protection, safety and health. Through regular communication with senior managers, site audits and experience sharing, the Company collaborates with major suppliers and contractors to enhance partnerships and ensure continued improvement of performance and increased joint contributions to society. As noted above, contractors performing high-risk activities must lay out clearly defined safety precautions and preventative measures. In addition, contractors working on high-risk engineering projects must establish ISO 45001 or OHSAS 18001 systems and the workers must successfully complete work-related skill training. All contractors performing high-risk activities have obtained ISO 45001 certification before the end of 2021.Supply Chain SustainabilityTSMC works with suppliers in several fields of sustainable development, such as greening the supply chain, carbon management for climate change, mitigation of fire risk, ESH management and business continuity plans in the event of a natural disaster.Since becoming a full member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) in 2015, TSMC has completed implementation of the RBA code of conduct throughout the Company by performing self-assessments at its facilities worldwide and reviewing policies and procedures in the areas of labor, health and safety, environment, ethics and management systems.To enhance supply chain sustainability and streamline risk management, the Company is committed to collaborating with its suppliers to maintain full compliance with Taiwan’s environmental, safety, health and fire protection regulations. TSMC developed a supplier’s code of conduct, which 158159affirmed basic labor rights and standards for health, safety, environment, ethics and management systems. TSMC works with suppliers to evaluate the risk and impact on the economy, the environment, and society and to make continuous improvement. The Company has helped boost suppliers’ performance of sustainability through experience sharing and training and hopes to establish a world-class semiconductor supply chain that exceeds international standards and serves as a global benchmark.TSMC is subject to the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure rule on conflict minerals released under Rule 13p-1 of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a recognized global leader in the high-tech supply chain, the Company acknowledges its corporate social responsibility to strive to procure conflict-free minerals in an effort to recognize humanitarian and ethical social principles that protect the dignity of all people. To this end, TSMC has implemented a series of compliance safeguards in accordance with leading industry practices such as adopting the due diligence framework in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)’s Model Supply Chain Policy for a Responsible Global Supply Chain of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High Risk Areas issued in 2011.TSMC is a strong supporter of the Responsible Business Alliance and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI), which will help the Company’s suppliers source conflict-free minerals through their jointly developed Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). Since 2011, TSMC has asked its suppliers to disclose information and make timely updates on smelters and mines. The Company encourages suppliers to source minerals from facilities or smelters that have received a “conflict free” designation by a recognized industry group (such as the RBA) and also requires those who have not received such designation to become compliant with Responsible Minerals Initiative or an equivalent third-party audit program. TSMC requires the use of conflict-free tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold in its products.TSMC will continue to conduct the supplier survey annually and require suppliers to improve and expand their disclosure to fulfill regulatory and customer requirements. For further information, see the Company’s Form SD filed with the U.S. SEC.

The winning teams are awarded a total prize of NT$3 million at the TSMC U Dreamer competition and begin a one-year Dreamer project.Empower Teachers in Rural Areas, Narrow the Gap between Urban and Rural SchoolsThe TSMC Education and Culture Foundation pays special attention to the gap between the education resources in the urban versus rural areas. Since 2004, the Foundation has partnered with CommonWealth Education Foundation to launch the “Hope Reading Project,” which continues to improve the reading environment and culture in schools in rural areas. As a response to the implementation of the 7.3 TSMC Education and Culture FoundationTaiwan has had its biggest battle against the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. Every sector in the society has been gravely affected and the efforts to launch artistic, cultural and educational campaigns have been seriously challenged. In the face of the pandemic, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation still endeavours to continue its support for various educational and cultural events, art exhibitions and performance. At the same time, as a response to pandemic restriction measures, the Foundation taps into the power of technology to make its upmost efforts to encourage girls’ high schools to engage in the scientific fields, to empower teachers in rural communities, and to initiate classes that teach and continue traditional theater courses on university campuses. In doing so, the cultural and educational work to which the Foundation has dedicated itself would not be disrupted because of the severe pandemic situation. In 2021, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation has invested NT$87 millions in culture and education events that revolve around three main themes: “nurture young talents,” “education collaboration,” and “advocation for arts and culture”. The Foundation’s efforts continue to inject abundant resources into the arts and education sectors in the society in order to drive the society to the common good, begin a positive cycle, and grow sustainably.Value Gender Diversity, Encourage Women to Engage in STEM FieldsThe TSMC Education and Culture Foundation teams up with National Museum of Natural Science to organize the TSMC Female Scientists Tour. Through trips to science museums and talks by female scientists, the Foundation hopes to spark female students’ interest and nurture female talent in the sciences. In 2021, the Foundation invited 450 girls from 12 girls’ high schools in Taiwan to take part in the TSMC Female Scientists Tour, whose program includes a visit to the educational hall at the World of Semiconductors. The trip was guided by female engineers at TSMC, giving students a chance to further understand the designing, manufacturing and application of semi-conductors. Other events in the trip include talks by renown Taiwanese female scientists and outstanding female engineers to share with young students their educational trajectory and work experiences. The students further learned the application of basic electronics at circuit board workshops. The TSMC Education and Culture new General Guidelines of Curriculum Guidelines of 12-Year Basic Education, the Foundation recognises the importance of empowering frontline educators. Therefore, in 2021, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation works in tandem with the CommonWealth Education Foundation and the Reading Research and Education Center of Dr. Hwawei Ko of National Tsing Hua University to initiate a five-year “Teaching & Learning” project. This project is launched in 51 schools in rural communities, whose contents include offering professional lesson plans for teachers, online educational recommendations, and support system while building a mechanism to research and discuss classroom teaching plans. The project creates a strong support for teachers in the rural areas, helps the teachers guide children in rural communities to improve their reading and writing capacities in real terms, opens up makeover opportunities, and narrows the gap between urban and rural schooling in real terms.On top of the empowering project for teachers in rural schools, the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation continues to invest in education for the underprivileged students, encouraging them to attain a college education. In 2021, a total of 82 students from disadvantage backgrounds have been awarded scholarships to study at National Central University, National Tsing Hua University, National Chung Cheng University, National Cheng Kung University, and National Sun Yat-sen University. The scholarships allow the students to study without care.Arts and Culture Education Takes Root in the Young, Pass the Cultural TorchThe TSMC Education and Culture Foundation places a high value on culture, continues to support the foundations of arts and culture education. In 2021, the Foundation collaborates with GuoGuang Opera Company on the “Pass the Theater Torch on College Campus” project, funding a year-long course at National Tsing Hua University and Tunghai University. The course contents include background knowledge on Peking opera and textual analysis of the plays. The classes invited professional actors from GuoGuang Opera Company to teach the students the acting techniques of Peking opera in person. The performance practices in class deepen the students’ experience of traditional theater, created opportunities for traditional art to reach to a new generation and provide the soil for the seeds of theater to take root. Apart from offering classes on university campuses, the Foundation organized four special “TSMC Theater – When Love Knocks at your Door” 160161performances of Peking opera for nearly 500 students from high schools in the Hsinchu area, from National Tsing Hua and Yang Ming Chiao Tung Universities. Through professional guided talks and demonstrations from professional actors, the Foundation lead the younger generation to appreciate the beauty of Peking opera. Furthermore, in 2021 the TSMC Education and Culture Foundation sponsors the broadcasting program “The Stories of Peking Opera” on the radio station, Sound of IC: Sound of Hsinchu Science Park. The program is hosted by GuoGuang Opera Company’s artistic director Anqi Wang and National Tsing Hua University’s Associate Professor Lo Shih-lung of the Department of Chinese Literature, introducing theater culture in depth but in way easy for lay people to understand by giving the audience a peek into the interesting cultural allusions behind the traditional drama plays.As well as the traditional theatre, the Foundation continues to sponsor National Symphony Orchestra, beginning the second year “Music Traverse” project and inviting conductor Lü Shao-chia to teach a master class. The Foundation hopes to broaden the music students’ artistic horizon through the experience of music maestros and the continuation of techniques. Meanwhile, the master classes were preserved in the form of documentaries, which will be publicly broadcast in media and streamed online, thereby allowing more students and the public to appreciate the beauty of classical music.The annual TSMC Hsinchu Arts Festival in 2021 centered around the theme of Her Stage, painting portraits of female artists through exhibitions, performances and public talks. The theme of Her Stage demonstrated to the public the extraordinary achievements of female artists and presented their life stories. Although some of the 28 exquisite programs took place online due to the pandemic, they still attracted over 17,000 viewers.7.4 TSMC Charity FoundationSince its establishment in 2017, the TSMC Charity Foundation has focused on the four pillars of public welfare in its charitable programs and projects: Care for the Disadvantaged, Taking Care of the Elderly, Filial Piety Promotion, and Protection of the Environment.

If the lease transfers ownership of the underlying assets to the Company by the end of the lease terms or if the cost of right-of-use assets reflects that the Company will exercise a purchase option, the Company depreciates the right-of-use assets from the commencement dates to the end of the useful lives of the underlying assets.  Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of the lease payments. Lease payments comprise fixed payments, variable lease payments which depend on an index or a rate and the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option. The lease payments are discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rates.  Subsequently, lease liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognized over the lease terms. When there is a change in a lease term, a change in future lease payments resulting from a change in an index or a rate used to determine those payments, or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase an underlying asset, the Company remeasures the lease liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use assets. Lease liabilities are presented on a separate line in the consolidated balance sheets.  Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.  Intangible Assets  Goodwill  Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any.  Other intangible assets  Other separately acquired intangible assets with finite useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is recognized using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives: Technology license fees - the estimated life of the technology or the term of the technology transfer contract; software and system design costs - 3 years or contract period; patent and others - the economic life or contract period. The estimated useful life and amortization method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.  Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets  Goodwill  Goodwill is not amortized and instead is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the cash generating unit may be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company’s cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the difference is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to such cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the cash generating unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the cash generating unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.    - 24 -   - 25 - Tangible assets, right-of-use assets and other intangible assets  At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets (property, plant and equipment), right-of-use assets and other intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.  Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.  If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.  When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or a cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. The performance obligations are satisfied when customers obtain control of the promised goods, which is generally when the goods are delivered to the customers’ specified locations.  Revenue from sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. Estimated sales returns and other allowances is generally made and adjusted based on historical experience and the consideration of varying contractual terms to recognize refund liabilities, which is classified under accrued expenses and other current liabilities.  In principle, payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 30 days from the end of the month of when the invoice is issued. Due to the short term nature of the receivables from sale of goods with the immaterial discounted effect, the Company measures them at the original invoice amounts without discounting.  Employee Benefits  Short-term employee benefits  Liabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for service rendered by employees.  Retirement benefits  For defined contribution retirement benefit plans, payments to the benefit plan are recognized as an expense when the employees have rendered service entitling them to the contribution. For defined benefit retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing benefit is recognized based on actuarial calculations. - 25 -   - 26 -  Defined benefit costs (including service cost, net interest and remeasurement) under the defined benefit retirement benefit plans are determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Service cost (including current service cost), and net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) are recognized as employee benefits expense in the period they occur. Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest), is recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss.   Net defined benefit liability represents the actual deficit in the Company’s defined benefit plan.  Taxation  Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.  Current tax  Income tax on unappropriated earnings (excluding earnings from foreign consolidated subsidiaries) is expensed in the year the shareholders approved the appropriation of earnings which is the year subsequent to the year the earnings are generated.  Adjustments of prior years’ tax liabilities are added to or deducted from the current year’s tax provision.  Deferred tax  Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits for research and development expenses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.   Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Company is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.  The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered. The deferred tax assets which originally not recognized is also reviewed at the end of each reporting period and recognized to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.  Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year in which the liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.  Current and deferred tax for the year  Current and deferred tax are recognized in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. - 26 -   - 27 -  Government Grants  Government grants are not recognized until there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.  Government grants whose primary condition is that the Company should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire noncurrent assets (mainly including land use right and depreciable assets) are recognized as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related assets and recognized as a reduced depreciation or amortization charge in profit or loss over the contract period or useful lives of the related assets. Government grants that are receivables as compensation for expenses already incurred are deducted from incurred expenses in the period in which they become receivables.    5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION AND UNCERTAINTY  The Company has considered the economic implications of COVID-19 on critical accounting estimates and will continue evaluating the impact on its financial position and financial performance as a result of the pandemic.  In the application of the aforementioned Company’s accounting policies, the Company is required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.  The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of the revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.  Critical Accounting Judgments  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognizes revenue when the conditions described in Note 4 are satisfied.  Commencement of Depreciation Related to Property, Plant and Equipment Classified as Equipment under Installation and Construction in Progress (EUI/CIP)  As described in Note 4, commencement of depreciation related to EUI/CIP involves determining when the assets are available for their intended use. The criteria the Company uses to determine whether EUI/CIP are available for their intended use involves subjective judgments and assumptions about the conditions necessary for the assets to be capable of operating in the intended manner.  Judgments on Lease Terms   In determining a lease term, the Company considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise or not to exercise an option, including any expected changes in facts and circumstances from the commencement date until the exercise date of the option. Main factors considered include contractual terms and conditions covered by the optional periods, and the importance of the underlying asset to the lessee’s operations, etc. The lease term is reassessed if a significant change in circumstances that are within the control of the Company occurs.    - 27 -   - 28 - Key Sources of Estimation and Uncertainty  Estimation of Sales Returns and Allowances  Sales returns and other allowance is estimated and recorded based on historical experience and in consideration of different contractual terms. The amount is deducted from revenue in the same period the related revenue is recorded. The Company periodically reviews the reasonableness of the estimates.  Valuation of Inventory  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the Company uses estimate to determine the net realizable value of inventory at the end of each reporting period.  The Company estimates the net realizable value of inventory for normal waste, obsolescence and unmarketable items at the end of reporting period and then writes down the cost of inventories to net realizable value. The net realizable value of the inventory is determined mainly based on assumptions of future demand within a specific time horizon.  Impairment of Tangible Assets, Right-of-use Assets and Intangible Assets Other than Goodwill  In the process of evaluating the potential impairment of tangible assets, right-of-use assets and intangible assets other than goodwill, the Company determines the independent cash flows, useful lives, expected future revenue and expenses related to the specific asset groups with the consideration of the nature of semiconductor industry. Any change in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in significant impairment charges or reversal in future years.  Realization of Deferred Income Tax Assets  Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those deferred tax assets can be utilized. Assessment of the realization of the deferred tax assets requires subjective judgment and estimate, including the future revenue growth and profitability, tax holidays, the amount of tax credits can be utilized and feasible tax planning strategies. Any changes in the global economic environment, the industry trends and relevant laws and regulations could result in significant adjustments to the deferred tax assets.  Determination of Lessees’ Incremental Borrowing Rates  In determining a lessee’s incremental borrowing rate used in discounting lease payments, the Company mainly takes into account the market risk-free rates, the estimated lessee’s credit spreads and secured status in a similar economic environment.    6.

The hedge ratio is adjusted in response to the changes in the financial market and capped at 100%.  On the basis of economic relationships, the value of the interest rate futures contracts and the value of the hedged financial assets change in opposite directions in response to movements in interest rates.  The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is the credit risk of the hedged financial assets, which is not reflected in the fair value of the interest rate futures contracts. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships during the hedging period. Amount of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in profit or loss is classified under other gains and losses, net.  The following tables summarize the information relating to the hedges of interest rate risks.

The hedge ratio is adjusted in response to the changes in the financial market and capped at 100%. The forward contracts have maturities of 12 months or less.  On the basis of economic relationships, the Company expects that the value of forward contracts and the value of hedged transactions will change in opposite directions in response to movements in foreign exchange rates or interest rates.  The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is driven by the effect of the counterparty’s own credit risk on the fair value of forward contracts. No other sources of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, refer to Note 21(d) for gain or loss arising from changes in the fair value of hedging instruments, the amount transferred to initial carrying amount of hedged items and the amount reclassified to finance costs of hedged items.

These accounts receivable are classified as at FVTOCI because they are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.  In principle, the payment term granted to customers is due 30 days from the invoice date or 30 days from the end of the month when the invoice is issued. Aside from recognizing impairment loss for credit-impaired accounts receivable, the Company recognizes loss allowance based on the expected credit loss ratio of customers by different risk levels with consideration of factors of historical loss ratios and customers’ financial conditions, competitiveness and business outlook. For accounts receivable past due over 90 days without collaterals or guarantees, the Company recognizes loss allowance at full amount.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS  a. Defined contribution plans  The plan under the R.O.C. Labor Pension Act (the “Act”) is deemed a defined contribution plan. Pursuant to the Act, TSMC and VisEra Tech have made monthly contributions equal to 6% of each employee’s monthly salary to employees’ pension accounts. Furthermore, TSMC North America, TSMC Arizona, TSMC China, TSMC Nanjing, TSMC Europe, TSMC Canada and TSMC Technology also make monthly contributions at certain percentages of the basic salary of their employees. Accordingly, the Company recognized expenses of NT$3,711,010 thousand and NT$2,809,484 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  b. Defined benefit plans  TSMC has defined benefit plans under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law that provide benefits based on an employee’s length of service and average monthly salary for the six-month period prior to retirement. The Company contributes an amount equal to 2% of salaries paid each month to their respective pension funds (the Funds), which are administered by the Labor Pension Fund Supervisory Committee (the Committee) and deposited in the Committee’s name in the Bank of Taiwan. Before the end of each year, the Company assesses the balance in the Funds. If the amount of the balance in the Funds is inadequate to pay retirement benefits for employees who conform to retirement requirements in the next year, the Company is required to fund the difference in one appropriation that should be made before the end of - 44 -   - 45 - March of the next year. The Funds are operated and managed by the government’s designated authorities; as such, the Company does not have any right to intervene in the investments of the Funds.  Amounts recognized in respect of these defined benefit plans were as follows:    Years Ended December 31   2021  2020      Current service cost    $ 145,289    $ 123,311 Net interest expense     47,196     81,604 Components of defined benefit costs recognized in profit or loss     192,485     204,915 Remeasurement on the net defined benefit liability:     Return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest expense)     (73,298)     (139,212) Actuarial loss arising from experience adjustments     94,278     494,051 Actuarial loss arising from changes in demographic assumptions     277,454     - Actuarial (gain) loss arising from changes in financial assumptions     (540,513)     3,161,910 Components of defined benefit costs recognized in other comprehensive income     (242,079)     3,516,749      Total    $ (49,594)    $ 3,721,664  The pension costs of the aforementioned defined benefit plans were recognized in profit or loss by the following categories:    Years Ended December 31   2021  2020      Cost of revenue    $ 124,548    $ 126,274 Research and development expenses     52,801     57,306 General and administrative expenses     12,430     18,248 Marketing expenses     2,706     3,087              $ 192,485    $ 204,915  The amounts arising from the defined benefit obligation of the Company were as follows:    December 31, 2021  December 31, 2020      Present value of defined benefit obligation    $ 16,585,442    $ 16,980,277 Fair value of plan assets     (5,548,563)     (5,066,203)      Net defined benefit liability    $ 11,036,879    $ 11,914,074    - 45 -   - 46 - Movements in the present value of the defined benefit obligation were as follows:    Years Ended December 31   2021  2020      Balance, beginning of year    $ 16,980,277    $ 13,484,090 Current service cost     145,289     123,311 Interest expense     66,664     118,808 Remeasurement:           Actuarial loss arising from experience adjustments     94,278     494,051 Actuarial loss arising from changes in demographic assumptions     277,454     - Actuarial (gain) loss arising from changes in financial assumptions     (540,513)     3,161,910 Benefits paid from plan assets      (431,817)     (398,986) Benefits paid directly by the Company     (6,190)     (2,907)      Balance, end of year    $ 16,585,442    $ 16,980,277  Movements in the fair value of the plan assets were as follows:    Years Ended December 31   2021  2020      Balance, beginning of year    $ 5,066,203    $ 4,301,594 Interest income     19,468     37,204 Remeasurement:     Return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest expense)     73,298     139,212 Contributions from employer     821,411     987,179 Benefits paid from plan assets     (431,817)     (398,986)      Balance, end of year    $ 5,548,563    $ 5,066,203  The fair value of the plan assets by major categories at the end of reporting period was as follows:    December 31, 2021  December 31, 2020      Cash    $ 1,000,961   $ 632,769 Equity instruments     2,951,835     2,926,745 Debt instruments     1,595,767     1,506,689              $ 5,548,563    $ 5,066,203  The actuarial valuations of the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out by qualified actuaries. The principal assumptions of the actuarial valuation were as follows:    Measurement Date   December 31, 2021  December 31, 2020      Discount rate  0.75%     0.40% Future salary increase rate  3.00%     3.00%(Note)  Note: The Company has an additional 20 percent pay raise in 2021. - 46 -   - 47 -  Through the defined benefit plans under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law, the Company is exposed to the following risks:  1) Investment risk: The pension funds are invested in equity and debt securities, bank deposits, etc. The investment is conducted at the discretion of the government’s designated authorities or under the mandated management. However, under the R.O.C. Labor Standards Law, the rate of return on assets shall not be less than the average interest rate on a two-year time deposit published by the local banks and the government is responsible for any shortfall in the event that the rate of return is less than the required rate of return.  2) Interest risk: A decrease in the government bond interest rate will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in the return on the debt investments of the plan assets.  Assuming a hypothetical decrease in interest rate at the end of the reporting period contributed to a decrease of 0.5% (and not below 0.0%) in the discount rate and all other assumptions were held constant, the present value of the defined benefit obligation would increase by NT$780,460 thousand and NT$694,732 thousand as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  3) Salary risk: The present value of the defined benefit obligation is calculated by reference to the future salaries of plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the plan participants will increase the present value of the defined benefit obligation.  Assuming the expected salary rate increases by 0.5% at the end of the reporting period and all other assumptions were held constant, the present value of the defined benefit obligation would increase by NT$759,527 thousand and NT$835,964 thousand as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  The sensitivity analysis presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.   Furthermore, in presenting the above sensitivity analysis, the present value of the defined benefit obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the defined benefit obligation liability.  The Company expects to make contributions of NT$2,269,881 thousand to the defined benefit plans in the next year starting from December 31, 2021. The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 9 years.   21. EQUITY  a.

The authorized shares include 500,000 thousand shares allocated for the exercise of employee stock options.  As of December 31, 2021, 1,064,243 thousand ADSs of TSMC were traded on the NYSE. The number of common shares represented by the ADSs was 5,321,213 thousand shares (one ADS represents five common shares).  b. Capital surplus    December 31, 2021  December 31, 2020      Additional paid-in capital    $ 24,184,939    $ 24,184,939 From merger     22,804,510     22,804,510 From convertible bonds     8,892,847     8,892,847 From difference between the consideration received and the carrying amount of the subsidiaries’ net assets during actual disposal     8,406,282     - From share of changes in equities of subsidiaries     113,952     121,843 From share of changes in equities of associates      307,322     302,526 Donations     51,750     40,578              $ 64,761,602    $ 56,347,243  Under the relevant laws, the capital surplus generated from the excess of the issuance price over the par value of capital stock (including the stock issued for new capital, mergers and convertible bonds), the difference between the consideration received and the carrying amount of the subsidiaries’ net assets during actual disposal and donations may be used to offset a deficit; in addition, when the Company has no deficit, such capital surplus may be distributed as cash dividends or stock dividends up to a certain percentage of TSMC’s paid-in capital. The capital surplus from share of changes in equities of subsidiaries and associates and dividend of a claim extinguished by a prescription may be used to offset a deficit.  c. Retained earnings and dividend policy  TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation provide that, earnings distribution may be made on a quarterly basis after the close of each quarter. Distribution of earnings by way of cash dividends should be approved by TSMC’s Board of Directors and reported to TSMC’s shareholders in its meeting. When allocating earnings, TSMC shall first estimate and reserve the taxes to be paid, offset its losses, set aside a legal capital reserve at 10% of the remaining earnings (until the accumulated legal capital reserve equals TSMC’s paid-in capital), then set aside a special capital reserve in accordance with relevant laws or regulations or as requested by the authorities in charge. Any balance left over shall be allocated according to relevant laws and the TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation.  TSMC’s Articles of Incorporation also provide that profits of TSMC may be distributed by way of cash dividend and/or stock dividend. However, distribution of earnings shall be made preferably by way of cash dividend. Distribution of earnings may also be made by way of stock dividend, provided that the ratio for stock dividend shall not exceed 50% of the total distribution.    - 48 -   - 49 - The legal capital reserve may be used to offset a deficit, or be distributed as dividends in cash or stocks for the portion in excess of 25% of the paid-in capital if the Company incurs no loss.
