We compete with companies providing connection, sharing,discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/ordevelop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but notlimited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to share, communicate, and discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach theirexisting or prospective audiences, including, for example, Alphabet (Google and YouTube),7Table of ContentsAmazon, Apple, ByteDance (TikTok), Microsoft, Snap (Snapchat), Tencent (WeChat), and Twitter. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use ourproducts, to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers to build compelling mobileand web applications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual and augmentedreality products and services. As we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products andservices, including as part of efforts to develop the metaverse, we may become subject to additional competition.TechnologyOur product development philosophy centers on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are social by design, which means that ourproducts are designed to place people and their social interactions at the core of the product experience. As our user base grows, as engagement with products likevideo and VR increases, and as we deepen our investment in new technologies like artificial intelligence, our computing needs continue to expand. We makesignificant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones, as well as for our marketers and developers. Weare also investing in protecting the security, privacy, and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen our systems againstabuse.Sales and OperationsThe majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We also have a global sales force that isfocused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to them throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-making toreal-time optimizations to post-campaign analytics. We work directly with these advertisers, as well as through advertising agencies and resellers. We operate inmore than 80 cities around the globe, the majority of which have a sales presence. We also invest in and rely on self-service tools to provide direct customersupport to our users and partners.MarketingHistorically, our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with them, supported by internal efforts tostimulate awareness and interest. In addition, we have invested and will continue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help buildcommunity around the world.Intellectual PropertyTo establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, including know-how, licenseagreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and othercontractual rights. In addition, to further protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from third parties. Wedo not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the duration ofour patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products.Government RegulationWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, many of which are stillevolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations involve matters including privacy,data use, data protection and personal information, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution,data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, artificial intelligence, electronic contracts and other communications,competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controlsincluding sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. In particular, we are subject to federal,state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of people's data. Foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, consumer protection, and otherlaws and regulations can impose different obligations, or penalties or fines for non-compliance, or be more restrictive than those in the United States.8Table of ContentsThese U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, areconstantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are oftenuncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country andinconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our usersor obtain consent to various practices, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products, could adversely affect our financial results. In theUnited States, there have been, and continue to be, various efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230of the Communications Decency Act, and any such changes may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations,which could adversely affect our business and financial results.We are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receive certaindata that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. Ifwe are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products andservices, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affectour financial results. For example, the Privacy Shield, a transfer framework we relied upon for data transferred from the European Union to the United States, wasinvalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such asStandard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. In August 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from theIrish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) that preliminarily concluded that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of European user data does notachieve compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the European Union tothe United States should therefore be suspended. We believe a final decision in this inquiry may issue as early as the first half of 2022. If a new transatlantic datatransfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on SCCs or rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from Europe to the UnitedStates, we will likely be unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which wouldmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments in the past, and proposed or new legislation and regulations couldsignificantly affect our business. For example, the GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of theEuropean Union that are different from those previously in place in the European Union, requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our leadEuropean Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements ofthe regulation. The GDPR is still a relatively new law, its interpretation is still evolving, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review byother European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of suchinvestigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject tosignificant uncertainty. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-relatedrequirements on products and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect in January 2020,and its successor, the California Privacy Rights Act, which will take effect in January 2023, also establish certain transparency rules and create new data privacyrights for users. In addition, effective December 2020, the European Union's ePrivacy Directive includes additional limitations on the use of data across messagingproducts and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments mayadversely affect our advertising business. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal andstate level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. For example, the proposed DigitalMarkets Act in the European Union and pending proposals to modify competition laws in the United States and other jurisdictions could cause us to incursignificant compliance costs and could potentially impose new restrictions and requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the combination ofdata across services, mergers and acquisitions, and product design. In addition, some countries, such as India, are considering or have passed legislationimplementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity ofdelivering our services. New legislation or regulatory decisions that restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors may also result in limitations onour advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions.9Table of ContentsWe are, and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits by governmentauthorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumerprotection, civil rights, content moderation, and competition, as we continue to grow and expand our operations. We are also currently, and may in the future be,subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees, including the modified consent order we entered into with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which tookeffect in April 2020 and, among other matters, requires us to maintain a comprehensive privacy program. Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actionsinitiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties(including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, result in negativepublicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioralremedies that adversely affect our business.For additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Human CapitalAt Meta, we design products to bring the world closer together, one connection at a time. As a company, we believe that people are at the heart of everyconnection we build. We are proud of our unique company culture where ideas, innovation, and impact win, and we work hard to build strong teams acrossengineering, product design, marketing, and other areas to further our mission.We had a global workforce of 71,970 employees as of December 31, 2021, which represents a 23% year-over-year increase in employee headcount. Weexpect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future, particularly as we continue to focus on recruiting employees in technical functions. In addition, weplan to continue to hire a number of employees and contractors to continue to bolster various privacy, safety, security, and content review initiatives as well asother functions to support our expected growth.Our headquarters are located in Menlo Park, California and we have offices in more than 80 cities around the globe. The vast majority of our personnel arecurrently working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in the long term, we expect some personnel to continue to transition to working remotelyon a regular basis. We offer most of our full-time employees the option to work remotely on a regular basis.Diversity, Equity and InclusionDiversity, equity and inclusion are core to our work at Meta. We seek to build a diverse and inclusive workplace where we can leverage our collectivecognitive diversity to build the best products and make the best decisions for the global community we serve. While we have made progress, we still have morework to do.As part of our diversity and inclusion report, we publish our global gender diversity and U.S. ethnic diversity workforce data annually. As of June 30, 2021,our global employee base was comprised of 36.7% females and 63.3% males, and our U.S. employee base was comprised of the following ethnicities: 45.7%Asian, 39.1% White, 6.5% Hispanic, 4.4% Black, 3.9% two or more ethnicities, and 0.4% additional groups (including American Indian or Alaska Native andNative Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander). In recent years, we also announced our goals to have 50% of our workforce made up of underrepresented groups by2024, and to increase the representation of people of color in leadership positions in the United States, including Black leadership, by 30% from 2020 to 2025. Wewill also continue our ongoing efforts to increase the representation of women in leadership.We work to support our goals of diversifying our workforce through recruiting, retention, people development, and inclusion. We employ our Diverse SlateApproach in our global recruitment efforts, which ensures that teams and hiring managers have the opportunity to consider qualified people from underrepresentedgroups for open roles. We have seen steady increases in hiring rates of people from underrepresented groups since we started testing this approach in 2015. Wealso continue to develop inclusive internship programs, and Meta University, our training program for college freshmen and sophomores with an interest inComputer Science, also utilizes a proactive and inclusive approach to promote participation by people from underrepresented groups. To help build communityamong our people and support their professional development, we invest in our internal Meta Resource Groups and our annual Community events such asWomen's10Table of ContentsCommunity Summit, Black Community Summit, Latin Community Summit, and Pride Community Summit. We also offer Managing Unconscious Bias, ManagingInclusion, Be the Ally, and other trainings to promote an inclusive workplace by helping people understand the issues that affect underrepresented communitiesand how to reduce the effects of bias in the workplace.Compensation and BenefitsWe offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people, and we help care for our people so they can focus on our mission. Our employees'total compensation package includes market-competitive salary, bonuses or sales incentives, and equity. We generally offer full-time employees equity at the timeof hire and through annual equity grants because we want them to be owners of the company and committed to our long-term success. We have conducted payequity analyses for many years, and continue to be committed to pay equity. In 2021, we announced that our analyses indicate that we continue to have pay equityacross genders globally and race in the United States for people in similar jobs, accounting for factors such as location, role, and level.Through Life@ Meta, our holistic approach to benefits, we provide our employees and their loved ones with resources to help them thrive. We offer a widerange of benefits across areas such as health, family, finance, community, and time away, including healthcare and wellness benefits, family building benefits,family care resources, retirement savings plans, access to tax and legal services, Meta Resource Groups to build community at Meta, family leave, and paid timeoff.Corporate InformationWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004.

These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risksrelated to:Risks Related to Our Product Offerings•our ability to add and retain users and maintain levels of user engagement with our products;•the loss of, or reduction in spending by, our marketers;•reduced availability of data signals used by our ad targeting and measurement tools;•ineffective operation with mobile operating systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners;•failure of our new products, or changes to our existing products, to attract or retain users or generate revenue;Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results•the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on our advertising business;•our ability to compete effectively;•unfavorable media coverage and other risks affecting our ability to maintain and enhance our brands;•volatile or slower user and revenue growth rates in the future;•acquisitions and our ability to successfully integrate our acquisitions;•our ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure, and risks associated with disruptions in our service;•operating our business in multiple countries around the world;•litigation, including class action lawsuits;Risks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement•government restrictions on access to Facebook or our other products, or other actions that impair our ability to sell advertising, in their countries;•complex and evolving U.S. and foreign privacy, data use and data protection, content, competition, consumer protection, and other laws and regulations;12Table of Contents•the impact of government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, including litigation and investigations by privacy and competitionauthorities;•our ability to comply with regulatory and legislative privacy requirements, including our consent order with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC);Risks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property•the occurrence of security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, and other cyber incidents or undesirable activity on ourplatform;•our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights; andRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock•limitations on the ability of holders of our Class A Common Stock to influence corporate matters due to the dual class structure of our common stock andthe control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock by our founder, Chairman, and CEO.Risks Related to Our Product OfferingsIf we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products, our revenue, financial results, andbusiness may be significantly harmed.The size of our user base and our users' level of engagement across our products are critical to our success. Our financial performance has been and willcontinue to be significantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and engaging active users of our products that deliver ad impressions, particularly forFacebook and Instagram. We anticipate that our active user growth rate will continue to generally decline over time as the size of our active user base increases. Inaddition, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or more markets from timeto time, particularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates. User growth and engagement are also impacted by a number of other factors,including competitive products and services, such as TikTok, that have reduced some users' engagement with our products and services, as well as global andregional business and macroeconomic conditions. For example, beginning in the first quarter of 2020, we experienced significant increases in the size andengagement of our active user base across a number of regions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. More recently, we have seen these pandemic-related trendssubside. We are unable to predict the impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty, and these trends may continue to be subject tovolatility. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we experienced a slight decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the total number of DAUs on Facebook, as well as aslight decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the number of DAUs on Facebook in the United States & Canada region. Any future declines in the size of ouractive user base may adversely impact our ability to deliver ad impressions and, in turn, our financial performance.If people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increasethe frequency and duration of their engagement. A number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active userbases or levels of engagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base orengagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user engagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as we introduce new anddifferent products and services. Any number of factors can negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement, including if:•users increasingly engage with other competitive products or services;•we fail to introduce new features, products, or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products or services, or make changes to existingproducts and services, that are not favorably received;•users feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the frequency,13Table of Contentsprominence, format, size, and quality of ads that we display;•users have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of actions by us or third parties that we rely onto distribute our products and deliver our services;•user behavior on any of our products changes, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared on our products and services;•we are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a variety of mobile operating systems andnetworks, and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;•there are decreases in user sentiment due to questions about the quality or usefulness of our products or our user data practices, concerns about the natureof content made available on our products, or concerns related to privacy, safety, security, well-being, or other factors;•we are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is appropriate, interesting, useful, and relevant to them;•we are unable to obtain or attract engaging third-party content;•we are unable to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with our products;•users adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services, or may not be featured or otherwise available;•there are changes mandated by legislation, government and regulatory authorities, or litigation that adversely affect our products or users;•we are unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, or are otherwise limited inour business operations, as a result of European regulators, courts, or legislative bodies determining that our reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses(SCCs) or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States is invalid;•there is decreased engagement with our products, or failure to accept our terms of service, as part of privacy-focused changes that we have implementedor may implement in the future, whether voluntarily, in connection with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union's ePrivacyDirective, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), or other laws, regulations, or regulatory actions, or otherwise;•technical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience, such assecurity breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or similar content;•we adopt terms, policies, or procedures related to areas such as sharing, content, user data, or advertising, or we take, or fail to take, actions to enforce ourpolicies, that are perceived negatively by our users or the general public, including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independentOversight Board regarding content on our platform;•we elect to focus our product decisions on longer-term initiatives that do not prioritize near-term user growth and engagement (for example, we haveannounced plans to focus product decisions on optimizing the young adult experience in the long term);•we make changes in how we promote different products and services across our family of products;•initiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement are unsuccessful or discontinued, whether as a result of actions by us, third parties, orotherwise;14Table of Contents•third-party initiatives that may enable greater use of our products, including low-cost or discounted data plans, are scaled back or discontinued, or thepricing of data plans otherwise increases;•there is decreased engagement with our products as a result of taxes imposed on the use of social media or other mobile applications in certain countries,internet shutdowns, or other actions by governments that affect the accessibility of our products in their countries;•we fail to provide adequate customer service to users, marketers, developers, or other partners;•we, developers whose products are integrated with our products, or other partners and companies in our industry are the subject of adverse media reportsor other negative publicity, including as a result of our or their user data practices; or•our current or future products, such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable developers to build, grow, and monetizemobile and web applications, reduce user activity on our products by making it easier for our users to interact and share on third-party mobile and webapplications.From time to time, certain of these factors have negatively affected user retention, growth, and engagement to varying degrees. If we are unable to maintainor increase our user base and user engagement, particularly for our significant revenue-generating products like Facebook and Instagram, our revenue and financialresults may be adversely affected. Any significant decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products less attractive to users, marketers,and developers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our ability to deliver ad impressions and, accordingly, our revenue, business, financialcondition, and results of operations. As our active user growth rate continues to slow, we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increaselevels of user engagement and monetization in order to drive revenue growth.We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The loss of marketers, or reduction in spending by marketers, could seriously harm ourbusiness.Substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on Facebook and Instagram. As is common in the industry, ourmarketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budgetwith us. Marketers will not continue to do business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not deliver ads in an effectivemanner, if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives, or if they are not satisfiedfor any other reason. We have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability toeffectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. If we are unable to providemarketers with a suitable return on investment, the pricing of our ads may not increase, or may decline, in which case our revenue and financial results may beharmed.Our advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:•decreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products;•our inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products;•product changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or relative prominence of ads displayed on ourproducts or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our products;•our inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both;•our inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users;•changes to third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising, including changes by mobile operatingsystem and browser providers such as Apple and Google;15Table of Contents•adverse government actions or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments relating to advertising, including developments that may impact ourability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising;•user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize, such as our feed and Stories products,including as a result of increased usage of our Reels or other video or messaging products;•reductions of advertising by marketers due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that protect the security and integrity of ourplatform;•the availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of our adsto marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;•loss of advertising market share to our competitors, including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if competitors offer lower priced, more integrated,or otherwise more effective products;•limitations on our ability to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe as a result ofEuropean regulators, courts, or legislative bodies determining that our reliance on SCCs or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from theEuropean Union to the United States is invalid;•changes in our marketing and sales or other operations that we are required to or elect to make as a result of risks related to complying with foreign lawsor regulatory requirements or other government actions;•decisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of announcements by us or adverse media reports or other negative publicity involving us,our user data practices, our advertising metrics or tools, content on our products, our interpretation, implementation, or enforcement of policies relating tocontent on our products (including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board), developers with mobile and webapplications that are integrated with our products, or other companies in our industry;•reductions of advertising by marketers due to objectionable content made available on our products by third parties, questions about our user datapractices or the security of our platform, concerns about brand safety or potential legal liability, or uncertainty regarding their own legal and complianceobligations (for example, a number of marketers announced that they paused advertising with us in July 2020 due to concerns about content on ourproducts);•the effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users opt in or out of the use of data for ads, including as a result of product changes and controlsthat we have implemented or may implement in the future in connection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA),other laws, regulations, regulatory actions, or litigation, or otherwise, that impact our ability to use data for advertising purposes;•the degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they engage with our ads;•changes in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced;•the success of technologies designed to block the display of ads or ad measurement tools;•changes in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base; and•the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, whether in the advertising industry in general, or among specific types of marketers or withinparticular geographies.From time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees. The occurrence of any of these or otherfactors in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our ads, which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads, or cause marketers to stop advertisingwith us altogether, either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results. For example, macroeconomic conditions have affected, and may inthe future affect, marketers' ability or willingness to spend with us, as we experienced in 2020 with the regional and worldwide economic16Table of Contentsdisruption related to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated declines in advertising activity on our products. The effects of the pandemic previously resulted inreduced demand for our ads, a related decline in pricing of our ads, and additional demands on our technical infrastructure as a result of increased usage of ourservices, and any similar occurrences in the future may impair our ability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users and adversely affectour revenue and financial results.Our advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we donot control, and changes to the regulatory environment, third-party mobile operating systems and browsers, and our own products have impacted, and weexpect will continue to impact, the availability of such signals, which will adversely affect our advertising revenue.We rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users. Ouradvertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate these signals, and any changes in our ability to use such signals willadversely affect our business. For example, legislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, and CCPA, have impacted, and weexpect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In particular, we have seen an increasing number of users opt to control certaintypes of ad targeting in Europe following adoption of the GDPR, which will increase further with expanded control over certain third-party data as part of ourePrivacy Directive compliance, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in California following adoption of the CCPA.Regulatory guidance or decisions or new legislation in these or other jurisdictions may require us to make additional changes to our products in the future thatfurther reduce our ability to use these signals. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented productchanges and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising.For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our andother iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of thebudgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changesthat give users the ability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services, including our Off-FacebookActivity tool and our worldwide offering of certain product changes we implemented in connection with the GDPR. These developments have limited our ability totarget and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and negatively impacted our advertising revenue. For example, our advertising revenue in the secondhalf of 2021 was negatively impacted by marketer reaction to targeting and measurement challenges associated with iOS changes. If we are unable to mitigatethese developments as they take further effect in the future, our targeting and measurement capabilities will be materially and adversely affected, which would inturn significantly impact our future advertising revenue growth.Our user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies,products, and standards that we do not control.The substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue tofeature our products, or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of ourproducts with popular mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, such as the Android and iOS operatingsystems and mobile browsers. Any changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners,handset manufacturers, browser developers, or mobile carriers, or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our products' functionality, reduce or eliminateour ability to update or distribute our products, give preferential treatment to competitive products, limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectivenessof ads, or charge fees related to the distribution of our products or our delivery of ads could adversely affect the usage of our products and monetization on mobiledevices. For example, Apple previously released an update to its Safari browser that limits the use of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide themost relevant ads to our users and impacts monetization, and also released changes to iOS that limit our ability to target and measure ads effectively. We expectthat any similar changes to its, Google's, or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads andimpact monetization. Additionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile products, it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies,products, systems, networks, and standards that we do not control, and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, and browserdevelopers. We may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products thatoperate effectively with these technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. In the event that it is17Table of Contentsmore difficult for our users to access and use our products on their mobile devices, or if our users choose not to access or use our products on their mobile devicesor use mobile products that do not offer access to our products, our user growth and user engagement could be harmed. From time to time, we may also takeactions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our long-term best interests. Such actions mayadversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, browser developers, otherbusiness partners, or advertisers, and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated long-term benefits. In the event that our users areadversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate, our user growth, engagement, and monetization could be adverselyaffected and our business could be harmed. We have in the past experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies,products, and standards that we do not control, and any such occurrences in the future may negatively impact our user growth, engagement, and monetization onmobile devices, which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.Our new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits.Our ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existingproducts and to create successful new products, both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties. We may introduce significant changesto our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development oroperating experience. For example, we do not have significant experience with consumer hardware products or virtual or augmented reality technology, which mayadversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and technologies. We continue to incur substantial costs, and we may not besuccessful in generating profits, in connection with these efforts. In addition, the introduction of new products, or changes to existing products, may result in newor enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, or other complications that could adversely affect our business and financial results. We have alsoinvested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in growing our WhatsApp and Messenger products to support increasing usage of such products.We have historically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion, and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits frommessaging over the long term. In addition, we are moving forward with plans to implement end-to-end encryption across our messaging services, as well asfacilitate cross-app communication between these platforms, which plans have drawn governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions. If our new orenhanced products fail to engage users, marketers, or developers, or if our business plans are unsuccessful, we may fail to attract or retain users or to generatesufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business may be adversely affected.We make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.We frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent withour mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, we have implemented,and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extentadversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, our Off-Facebook Activity tool enables users to place limits on ourstorage and use of information about their interactions with advertisers' apps and websites, which reduces our ability to deliver the most relevant and effective adsto our users. Similarly, from time to time we update our News Feed ranking algorithm to optimize the user experience, and these changes have had, and may in thefuture have, the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with Facebook, which could adversely affect our financial results. From timeto time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, we have made, and weexpect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers, andcould reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products. We also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products, or introduce newstand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization, such as our feed products.In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the futurereduce, engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing asquickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we do not currently monetize at the same rate as our feed or Stories products. These decisionsmay adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.18Table of ContentsWe may not be successful in our metaverse strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.We believe the metaverse, an embodied internet where people have immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional screens, is the next evolution in socialtechnology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life. We expect this will be a complex,evolving, and long-term initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in privacy, safety, and securityefforts, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may not develop in accordance with ourexpectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build for the metaverse is uncertain. In addition, we have limited experience withconsumer hardware products and virtual and augmented reality technology, which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us. We may beunsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or developproducts that operate effectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. Our metaverse efforts may also divert resources andmanagement attention from other areas of our business. We expect to continue to make significant investments in virtual and augmented reality and othertechnologies to support these efforts, and our ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. Inaddition, as our metaverse efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions,including in the areas of privacy and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs, requiresignificant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other factors, our metaverse strategy and investments may not besuccessful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to expand our base of users, marketers, and developers may be impaired, and our businessand financial results may be harmed.We believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands iscritical to expanding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands willdepend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully. We may introducenew products or terms of service or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers oradvertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party mobile and web applications integrated with our products orinteracting with parties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions ordecisions regarding user privacy, data use, encryption, content, product design, algorithms, advertising, competition, and other issues, including actions ordecisions in connection with elections or the COVID-19 pandemic, which has in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our reputationand brands. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became the subject of media, legislative, and regulatory scrutiny as a result of a former employee'sallegations and release of internal company documents relating to, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcementpractices, as well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. In addition, in March 2018, we announced developmentsregarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies. We also may fail to respondexpeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of objectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers or developers, or to otherwiseenforce our policies or address user concerns, which has occurred in the past and which could erode confidence in our brands. Our brands may also be negativelyaffected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users, by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities, bythe use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading (or intended to manipulate opinions), by perceived or actual effortsby governments to obtain access to user information for security-related purposes or to censor certain content on our platform, by the use of our products orservices for illicit or objectionable ends, including, for example, any such actions around the pandemic or elections in the United States and around the world, bydecisions or recommendations regarding content on our platform from the independent Oversight Board, by research or media reports concerning the perceived oractual impacts of our products or services on user well-being, or by our decisions to remove content or suspend participation on our platform by persons whoviolate our community standards or terms of service. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will require us to make substantial investments and these investmentsmay not be successful. Certain of our actions, such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concerns around our handling of politicalspeech and advertising, hate speech, and other content, as well as user well-being issues, have eroded confidence in our brands and may continue to do so in thefuture. If we19Table of Contentsfail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and financial results may be adversely affected.We may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook andour other products.We have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build, grow, and monetize mobile and web applications that integrate withFacebook and our other products. Such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building, growing, or monetizing mobile and/or webapplications that create and maintain user engagement. Additionally, developers may choose to build on other platforms, including mobile platforms controlled bythird parties, rather than building products that integrate with Facebook and our other products. We are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectivesof our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience, and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retainsuch developers. For example, from time to time, we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on Facebook andour other products with the objective of enhancing the user experience, and such actions have reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and ourmonetization opportunities from, mobile and web applications integrated with our products. In addition, as part of our efforts related to privacy, safety, andsecurity, we conduct investigations and audits of platform applications from time to time, and we also have announced several product changes that restrictdeveloper access to certain user data. In some instances, these actions, as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers, have adverselyaffected, or will adversely affect, our relationships with developers. If we are not successful in our efforts to maintain or grow the number of developers thatchoose to build products that integrate with Facebook and our other products or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with suchdevelopers, our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected.Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial ResultsThe COVID-19 pandemic has previously had, and may in the future have, a significant adverse impact on our advertising revenue and also exposes ourbusiness to other risks.The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures from time to time to contain or mitigate the outbreak ofthe virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on business activity, quarantines, and shelter-in-place orders. These measures have caused, and arecontinuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in certain affected countries and regions, which have previously significantly impacted our business andresults of operations. For example, in the second quarter of 2020, our advertising revenue grew 10% year-over-year, which was the slowest growth rate for anyfiscal quarter since our initial public offering. While our advertising revenue growth rate improved in subsequent quarters, there can be no assurance that it will notdecrease again as a result of the effects of the pandemic. In addition, we believe that the pandemic previously contributed to an acceleration in the growth of onlinecommerce, which in turn increased demand for our advertising services. More recently, we believe this growth has moderated in many regions, and we mayexperience reduced advertising demand and related declines in pricing in future periods to the extent this trend continues, which could adversely affect ouradvertising revenue growth. The demand for and pricing of our advertising services may be materially and adversely impacted by the pandemic for the foreseeablefuture, and we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such impact with any certainty. In addition to the impact on our advertising business, the pandemicexposes our business, operations, and workforce to a variety of other risks, including:•volatility in the size of our user base and user engagement, particularly for our messaging products, whether as a result of shelter-in-place measures orother factors;•delays in product development or releases, or reductions in manufacturing production and sales of consumer hardware, as a result of inventory shortages,supply chain or labor shortages;•increased misuse of our products and services or user data by third parties, including improper advertising practices or other activity inconsistent with ourterms, contracts, or policies, misinformation or other illicit or objectionable material on our platforms, election interference, or other undesirable activity; 20Table of Contents•adverse impacts to our efforts to combat misuse of our products and services and user data as a result of limitations on our safety, security, and contentreview efforts while our workforce is working remotely, such as the necessity to rely more heavily on artificial intelligence to perform tasks that ourworkforce is unable to perform; •significant volatility and disruption of global financial markets, which could cause fluctuations in currency exchange rates or negatively impact our abilityto access capital in the future;•negative impact on our workforce productivity, product development, and research and development due to difficulties resulting from our personnelworking remotely; •illnesses to key employees, or a significant portion of our workforce, which may result in inefficiencies, delays, and disruptions in our business; and•increased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates used in our financial statements.Any of these developments may adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory actions against us. The persistence ofCOVID-19, and the preventative measures implemented to help limit the spread of the illness, have impacted, and will continue to impact, our ability to operateour business and may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.We compete with companies providing connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies thatsell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We facesignificant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to share, communicate, anddiscover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences, including, for example, Alphabet (Google andYouTube), Amazon, Apple, ByteDance (TikTok), Microsoft, Snap (Snapchat), Tencent (WeChat), and Twitter. We compete to attract, engage, and retain peoplewho use our products, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who buildcompelling mobile and web applications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtualand augmented reality products and services. As we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce newproducts and services, including as part of efforts to develop the metaverse, we may become subject to additional competition.Some of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources, experience, or stronger competitive positions in certain product segments,geographic regions, or user demographics than we do. For example, some of our competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political, legal,and regulatory regimes that enable them to compete more effectively than us. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to newor emerging technologies and changes in market conditions. We believe that some users, particularly younger users, are aware of and actively engaging with otherproducts and services similar to, or as a substitute for, our products and services, and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement withour products and services in favor of these other products and services. In the event that users increasingly engage with other products and services, we mayexperience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly, in which case our business would likely be harmed.Our competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching andsuccessful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Some competitors may gain a competitiveadvantage against us in areas where we operate, including: by making acquisitions; by limiting our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads; byimposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads; by making access to our products more difficult or impossible; by making it more difficult tocommunicate with our users; or by integrating competing platforms, applications, or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems,search engines, browsers, or e-commerce platforms. For example, each of Apple and Google have integrated competitive products with iOS and Android,respectively. In addition, Apple has released changes to iOS that limit our ability, and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry, to target and21Table of Contentsmeasure ads effectively. As a result, our competitors may, and in some cases will, acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at the expenseof our own efforts, which would negatively affect our business and financial results. In addition, from time to time, we may take actions in response to competitivethreats, but we cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results.We believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:•the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our competitors' products;•the size and composition of our user base;•the engagement of users with our products and competing products;•our ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services;•the timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors' products;•our safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their data;•our ability to distribute our products to new and existing users;•our ability to monetize our products;•the frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;•customer service and support efforts;•marketing and selling efforts, including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide marketers with a compelling return on theirinvestments;•our ability to establish and maintain developers' interest in building mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook and our other products;•our ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with Facebook and our other products;•changes mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us;•acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors;•our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers, designers, and product managers;•our ability to cost-effectively manage and grow our operations; and•our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors.If we are not able to compete effectively, our user base, level of user engagement, and ability to deliver ad impressions may decrease, we may become lessattractive to developers and marketers, and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.22Table of ContentsUnfavorable media coverage negatively affects our business from time to time.We receive a high degree of media coverage around the world. Unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our privacy practices, advertising policies,product changes, product quality, litigation or regulatory activity, government surveillance, the actions of our advertisers, the actions of our developers whoseproducts are integrated with our products, the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends, the substance or enforcement of our communitystandards, terms of service, or other policies, the actions of our users, the quality and integrity of content shared on our platform, the perceived or actual impacts ofour products or services on user well-being, or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to ours, has in the past, and could in the future,adversely affect our reputation. For example, we have been the subject of significant media coverage involving concerns around our handling of political speechand advertising, hate speech, and other content, as well as user well-being issues, and we continue to receive negative publicity related to these topics. Beginning inSeptember 2021, we became the subject of significant media coverage as a result of allegations and the release of internal company documents by a formeremployee. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be, subject to negative publicity in connection with our handling of misinformation and other illicit orobjectionable use of our products or services, including in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and elections in the United States and around the world. Anysuch negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and loyalty of our user base and marketer demand for advertising on our products,which could result in decreased revenue and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we have experienced such adverse effects to varying degreesfrom time to time.Our financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.Our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future. Additionally, we have a limited operating history with the currentscale of our business, which makes it difficult to forecast our future results. As a result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators offuture performance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets. Our financialresults in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, including:•our ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement, particularly for our products that deliver ad impressions;•our ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period;•our ability to recognize revenue or collect payments from marketers in a particular period, including as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;•fluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality, such as historically strong spending in the fourth quarter of each year, episodic regional orglobal events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors;•the frequency, prominence, size, format, and quality of ads shown to users;•the success of technologies designed to block the display of ads;•changes to third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising, including changes by mobile operatingsystem and browser providers such as Apple and Google;•the pricing of our ads and other products;•the diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on Facebook and Instagram;•our ability to generate revenue from Payments, or the sale of our consumer hardware products or other products we may introduce in the future;•changes to existing products or services or the development and introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors;23Table of Contents•user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize;•increases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we will incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive, includingcosts related to our data centers and technical infrastructure;•costs related to our privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts, including as a result of implementing changes to our practices, whethervoluntarily, in connection with laws, regulations, regulatory actions, or decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board, orotherwise;•costs and expenses related to the development, manufacturing, and delivery of our consumer hardware products;•our ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins;•costs related to acquisitions, including costs associated with amortization and additional investments to develop the acquired technologies;•charges associated with impairment of any assets on our balance sheet;•our ability to obtain equipment, components, and labor for our data centers and other technical infrastructure in a timely and cost-effective manner;•system failures or outages or government blocking, which could prevent us from serving ads for any period of time;•breaches of security or privacy, and the costs associated with any such breaches and remediation;•changes in the manner in which we distribute our products or inaccessibility of our products due to third-party actions;•fees paid to third parties for content or the distribution of our products;•refunds or other concessions provided to advertisers;•share-based compensation expense, including acquisition-related expense;•adverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs;•changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with respect to privacy, data protection, and content, or actions by governments orregulators, including fines, orders, or consent decrees;•the overall tax rate for our business, which is affected by the mix of income we earn in the U.S. and in jurisdictions with different tax rates, the effects ofshare-based compensation, the effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, the effects of changes in our business or structure, and theeffects of discrete items such as legal and tax settlements and tax elections;•the impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in the period such laws are enacted orinterpretations are issued, and may significantly affect the effective tax rate of that period;•tax obligations that may arise from resolutions of tax examinations, including the examination we are currently under by the Internal Revenue Service(IRS), that materially differ from the amounts we have anticipated;•fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies;•trading activity in our share repurchase program;24Table of Contents•fluctuations in the market values of our investments in marketable securities, in the valuation of our equity investments, and in interest rates;•changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and•changes in regional or global business or macroeconomic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may impact the otherfactors described above.Our rates of growth may be volatile in the near term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect they will decline over time in the future.We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, volatility in our user and revenue growth rates as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,although we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such volatility with any certainty. In the long term, we expect that our user growth rate will generallydecline over time as the size of our active user base increases, and the size of our active user base may fluctuate or decline in one or more markets, particularly aswe achieve greater market penetration. We also expect our revenue growth rate will continue to decline over time as our revenue increases to higher levels. As ourgrowth rates experience volatility or decline, investors' perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our Class A common stockcould decline.Our costs are continuing to grow, and some of our investments, particularly our investments in virtual and augmented reality, have the effect of reducing ouroperating margin and profitability. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.Operating our business is costly, and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base, as users increase the amountand types of content they consume and the data they share with us, for example with respect to video, as we develop and implement new products, as we marketnew and existing products and promote our brands, as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure, as we continue to invest in new and unproventechnologies, and as we continue to hire additional employees and contractors to support our expanding operations, including our efforts to focus on privacy,safety, security, and content review. In addition, from time to time we are subject to settlements, judgments, fines, or other monetary penalties in connection withlegal and regulatory developments that may be material to our business. We are also continuing to increase our investments in new platforms and technologies,including as we continue our efforts related to building the metaverse. Some of these investments, particularly our significant investments in virtual and augmentedreality, have generated only limited revenue and reduced our operating margin and profitability, and we expect the adverse financial impact of such investments tocontinue for the foreseeable future. For example, our investments in Reality Labs reduced our 2021 overall operating profit by approximately $10 billion, and weexpect our investments to increase in future periods. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.We plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions, which could impact our financial condition or results of operations and mayadversely affect the price of our common stock.As part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies,products, or technologies, and from time to time may enter into other strategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures. We may not be able to findsuitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions on favorable terms, or at all, including as a result ofregulatory challenges. For example, in 2021, the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority issued an order directing us to divest our Giphy acquisition,which we have appealed. In some cases, the costs of such acquisitions or other strategic transactions may be substantial, and there is no assurance that we willrealize expected synergies from future growth and potential monetization opportunities for our acquisitions or a favorable return on investment for our strategicinvestments.We may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions or other strategic transactions, which has occurred in the past and couldadversely affect our liquidity. The incurrence of indebtedness would also result in increased fixed obligations and increased interest expense, and could alsoinclude covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and weregularly grant RSUs to retain the employees of acquired companies, which could increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial results, and25Table of Contentsresult in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any acquisitions or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by users, marketers,developers, or investors, which may adversely affect our business or the price of our Class A common stock.We may also discover liabilities, deficiencies, or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance, whichmay result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence aredependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives, as wellas the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or otherstrategic transaction, including tax and accounting charges. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may also result in our recording of significant additionalexpenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing. Any of these factors mayadversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.We may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire.The integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that developproducts where we do not have prior experience, and we may not manage these processes successfully. We continue to make substantial investments of resourcesto support our acquisitions, which has in the past resulted, and we expect will in the future result, in significant ongoing operating expenses and the diversion ofresources and management attention from other areas of our business. We cannot assure you that these investments will be successful. If we fail to successfullyintegrate the companies we acquire, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.Our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption in our service, including as a resultof the COVID-19 pandemic, could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of users and engagement, and adversely affect our financial results.Our reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technicalinfrastructure. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, interruptions in the availability or performance of our products from time totime. Our systems may not be adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delays or outages thatcould be harmful to our business. If our products are unavailable when users attempt to access them, or if they do not load as quickly as expected, users may notuse our products as often in the future, or at all, and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted, any of which could adversely affect our business and financialperformance. We have experienced such issues to varying degrees from time to time. For example, in October 2021, a combination of an error and a bug resultedin an approximately six-hour outage of our services. In addition, as the amount and types of information shared on our products continue to grow and evolve, as theusage patterns of our global community continue to evolve, and as our internal operational demands continue to grow, we will need an increasing amount oftechnical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to satisfy our needs. It is possible that we may fail to continue to effectivelyscale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands, which may adversely affect our user engagement and advertising revenuegrowth. In addition, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures resulting from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters,power loss, terrorism, geopolitical conflict, other physical security threats, cyber-attacks, or other catastrophic events. Global climate change could result in certaintypes of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Any such events may result in users being subject to service disruptions oroutages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services, which may adverselyaffect our financial results. We also have been, and may in the future be, subject to increased energy or other costs to maintain the availability or performance ofour products in connection with any such events.In 2020, the increase in the use of our products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic increased demands on our technical infrastructure. We may not beable to accommodate any such demands in the future, including as a result of our reduced data center operations and personnel working remotely during thepandemic.A substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties. Any disruption or failure in the services26Table of Contentswe receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business. Any financial or otherdifficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability toproblems with the services they provide. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, supply andlabor shortages and other disruptions in logistics and the supply chain for our technical infrastructure. As a result, we have had to make certain changes to ourprocurement practices, and in the future we may not be able to procure sufficient components, equipment, or services from third parties to satisfy our needs, or wemay be required to procure such components, equipment, or services on unfavorable terms.Any of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products, require unfavorable changes to existing products,delay the introduction of future products, or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.We could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure.We have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products, and we plan tocontinue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers, subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems, and other projects.The infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations around the world, including in emerging markets thatexpose us to increased risks relating to anti-corruption compliance and political challenges, among others. We have in the past suspended, and may in the futuresuspend, certain of these projects as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional unanticipated delays or disruptions in the completion of these projects,including due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portions of such projects, or availability of components, challenges in obtaining required governmentor regulatory approvals, or other geopolitical challenges or actions by governments, whether as a result of the pandemic, trade disputes, or otherwise, may lead toincreased project costs, operational inefficiencies, interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality or reliability of our products, or impairment of assetson our balance sheet. In addition, there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation,which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment, that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs.Further, much of our technical infrastructure is located outside the United States, and it is possible that action by a foreign government, or our response to suchgovernment action, could result in the impairment of a portion of our technical infrastructure, which may interrupt the delivery or degrade the quality or reliabilityof our products and lead to a negative user experience or increase our costs. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.Real or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.The numbers for our key metrics, which include our Family metrics (DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP)) and Facebook metrics (DAUs,MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU)), are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts. While these numbers are basedon what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of ourproducts across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and are alsosusceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may changedue to improvements or changes in our methodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we discoverinaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate ourhistorical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do notintend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below.In addition, our Family metrics and Facebook metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology.Many people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individualproduct. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would notreflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook,Instagram, Messenger,27Table of Contentsand WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore must seek toattribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex techniques, algorithms andmachine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user accounts within an individual productand across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. These techniques andmodels require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties.We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error marginfor our Family metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it isvery difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people usingour products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics mayindicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.To calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews oflimited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates.For example, to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses,and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which are inherentlysubject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Familymetrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for ourFamily metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals for someproducts compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user accounts andprimarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts on our other products. Similarly, although MessengerKids users are included in our Family metrics, we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of calculating DAP andMAP. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, limitations while our personnel work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, or otherfactors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of Familymetrics also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes, or otherimprovements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwiseevaluate the broad population of our users. In addition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).We regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of "violating" accounts. We define "violating" accountsas accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2021, weestimated that approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sampleof accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look for account information and behaviors associated withFacebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to encryption. Inaddition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as webelieve they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take otheractions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP and MAP estimates in a particular period. We intend todisclose our estimates of the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure atour scale, and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.We also regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics to estimate the number of "duplicate" and "false" accounts among our MAUs. A duplicate account is onethat a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account. We divide "false" accounts into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users havecreated personal profiles for a business, organization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on Facebook using a Page rather than apersonal profile under our terms of service); and (2) violating accounts, which represent user profiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes thatviolate our terms of service, such as bots and spam. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts28Table of Contentsare based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, to identify duplicateaccounts we use data signals such as identical IP addresses and similar user names, and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or otherbehavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers. Any loss of access to data signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions,actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, limitations while our personnel work remotely during the COVID-19pandemic, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and false accounts. Our estimates also may change as ourmethodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies or product changes that may allow us to identify previouslyundetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users. Duplicate and false accounts are very difficult tomeasure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.In the fourth quarter of 2021, we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11% of our worldwide MAUs. We believe thepercentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as the Philippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets. Inthe fourth quarter of 2021, we estimated that false accounts may have represented approximately 5% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false accounts canvary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries such as Indonesia, Nigeria,and Vietnam. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accountsamong our users, which may also reduce our DAU and MAU estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the number of duplicate andfalse accounts among our MAUs on an annual basis.Other data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while user-provided data indicates a decline inusage among younger users, this age data may be unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age. Accordingly,our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete.In addition, our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user's IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing Facebook from thelocation of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptibleto algorithm or other technical errors, and our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors.In addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics and estimates, including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads.Many of our metrics involve the use of estimations and judgments, and our metrics and estimates are subject to software bugs, inconsistencies in our systems, andhuman error. Such metrics and estimates also change from time to time due to improvements or changes in our terminology or methodology, including as a resultof loss of access to data signals we use in calculating such metrics and estimates. We have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to litigation as well asmarketer, regulatory, and other inquiries regarding the accuracy of such metrics and estimates. Where marketers, developers, or investors do not perceive ourmetrics or estimates to be accurate, or where we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics or estimates, we may be subject to liability, our reputation may beharmed, and marketers and developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to our products that deliver ad impressions, which could negativelyaffect our business and financial results.We cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth.Our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly, with the number of employees increasing to 71,970 asof December 31, 2021 from 58,604 as of December 31, 2020, and we expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, we plan tocontinue to hire a number of employees and contractors to continue to bolster various privacy, safety, security, and content review initiatives as well as otherfunctions to support our expected growth. The growth and expansion of our business and products create significant challenges for our management, operational,and financial resources, including managing multiple relationships with users, marketers, developers, and other third parties. As our operations and the number ofour third-party relationships continue to grow, our information technology systems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support suchgrowth. In addition, some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation, so our management maynot29Table of Contentsbe able to manage such growth effectively. Additionally, the vast majority of our personnel are currently working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,which limits their ability to perform certain job functions and may negatively impact productivity. In the long term, we may experience such challenges toproductivity and collaboration as some personnel transition to working remotely on a regular basis, and we may experience difficulties integrating recently hiredpersonnel when our offices re-open. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to adapt to a remote work environment; improve our operational,financial, and management processes and systems; and effectively expand, train, and manage our personnel. As our organization continues to grow, and we arerequired to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture,including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. This could negatively affect our business performance.We have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have more limited operating experience, andthis may subject us to increased business, economic, and legal risks that could affect our financial results.We have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business operations and the translation of our products.We currently make Facebook available in more than 100 different languages, and we have offices or data centers in more than 30 different countries. We may enternew international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our products. Our products are generally available globally,but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain markets due to legal and regulatory complexities. For example, several of ourproducts are not generally available in China. We also outsource certain operational functions to third-party vendors globally. If we fail to deploy, manage, oroversee our international operations successfully, our business may suffer. In addition, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing businessinternationally, including:•political, social, or economic instability;•risks related to legal, regulatory, and other government scrutiny applicable to U.S. companies with sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions, includingwith respect to privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, trade compliance, supply chain, competition, consumer protection, intellectual property,environmental, health and safety, licensing, and infrastructure matters;•potential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or requirements to provide userinformation to local authorities;•enhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards across different languages and countries;•fluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls;•foreign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the UnitedStates or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely, and impede our ability to invest such cash efficiently;•higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;•enhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;•burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including laws related to taxation, content removal, content moderation, data localization, dataprotection, e-commerce and payments, and regulatory oversight;•reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;•difficulties in staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated withmultiple international locations, including difficulties arising from personnel working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic;•compliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences; and30Table of Contents•geopolitical events affecting us, our marketers or our industry, including trade disputes and pandemics.In addition, we must manage the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices in any given jurisdiction and our obligations to comply withlaws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws or regulations applicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010.We also must manage our obligations to comply with laws and regulations related to import and export controls, trade restrictions, and sanctions, includingregulations established by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Government agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties theymay seek to impose against companies for violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations, import and export controls, trade restrictions, sanctions, and other laws,rules, and regulations.If we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our financial results could be adverselyaffected. We also may be required to or elect to cease or modify our operations or the offering of our products and services in certain regions, including as a resultof the risks described above, which could adversely affect our business, user growth and engagement, and financial results.We face design, manufacturing, and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could adversely impact our financial results.We face a number of risks related to design, manufacturing, and supply chain management with respect to our consumer hardware products. For example,the consumer hardware products we sell from time to time have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of theproducts, or from the software used in the products. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers.Our brand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues, other failures to meet our customers' expectations, or findings of ourconsumer hardware products to be defective.We rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer hardware products, which subjects us to anumber of risks that have been exacerbated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, supply or laborshortages or other disruptions in logistics and the supply chain, which could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations, product development,and sales. We could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those weengage with fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties, manufacturing or supply constraints, or other reasons), or make adverse changes inthe pricing or other material terms of such arrangements with them. The manufacturing, distribution, and sale of our consumer hardware products also may benegatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical challenges, trade disputes, or other actions by governments that subject us to supply shortages,increased costs, or supply chain disruptions.We also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and certain company policies regardingsourcing practices and standards on labor, health and safety, the environment, and business ethics, but we do not control them or their practices and standards. Ifany of them violates laws, fails to implement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws, or implements practices or standards regarded as unethical, corrupt,or non-compliant, we could experience supply chain disruptions, government action or fines, canceled orders, or damage to our reputation.We face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products.We are exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, unsafe ordefective merchandise, supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to ourconsumer hardware products, and other factors. The demand for our products can also change significantly between the time inventory or components are orderedand the date of sale. While we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking consumer hardware products we may sell, fromtime to time we have experienced difficulties in accurately predicting and meeting the consumer demand for our products. In addition, when we begin selling ormanufacturing a new consumer hardware product or enter new international markets, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriateproduct or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead-time andprepayment and they may not be returnable. Any one of the foregoing factors may adversely31Table of Contentsaffect our operating results.We are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming, and, if resolved adversely, could harmour business, financial condition, or results of operations.We are involved in numerous lawsuits, including stockholder derivative lawsuits and putative class action lawsuits, many of which claim statutory damagesand/or seek significant changes to our business operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future. Because of thescale of our user, advertiser, and developer base, the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages even if the allegedper-user or entity harm is small or non-existent. In addition, we have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to additional class action lawsuits based onclaims related to advertising, antitrust, privacy, biometrics, content, algorithms, employment, activities on our platform, consumer protection, or productperformance or other claims related to the use of consumer hardware and software, including virtual reality technology and products, which are new and unproven.For example, we are currently the subject of multiple putative class action suits in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certaindata by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of2018; our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as other alleged anticompetitive conduct; and a former employee's allegations and release of internalcompany documents beginning in September 2021. The results of any such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and any negative outcome fromany such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or undesirable changes to our products or business practices, and accordinglyour business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.There can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a significantburden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed uponappeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which has occurred in the pastand which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations.We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.Our tax obligations, including income and non-income taxes, are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements,including the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage, protect, and use our intellectual property, and the valuations of our intercompanytransactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and certainjurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as Meta. We are subject toregular review and audit by U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, including ourmethodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwideeffective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Forexample, in 2016 and 2018, the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the2010 through 2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS's position and are litigating this issue, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and, if resolved in amanner unfavorable to us, may adversely affect our financial results.The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are manytransactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business, andany changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes andestimates of our non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and maymaterially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.Our future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit split, changes in the amount and recognition ofdeferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles.32Table of ContentsChanges in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be subject to significant change.Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cashflows. For example, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate forthe fourth quarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the Tax Act, or other executive or Congressional actions in theUnited States or globally could materially increase our tax obligations and significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued or suchactions take effect, and in future periods. In addition, many countries have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted newlaws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate ourbusiness.Over the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Projectthat, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which wedo business. In 2021, more than 140 countries tentatively signed on to a framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15%, among other provisions. As thisframework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate impact of any such changes on our taxobligations are uncertain. Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals that would apply to various aspects of the current taxframework under which we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well as proposals to change or imposenew types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, several jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes applicable todigital services, which include business activities on digital advertising and online marketplaces, and which apply to our business.The European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation providespreferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and concluded that certain member states, including Ireland, have provided illegal state aid incertain cases. These investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations.Due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities described abovecould increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results ofoperations, and cash flows. Such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts estimated andrecorded in our financial statements.Given our levels of share-based compensation, our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price.The tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from period to period. In periods in which ourstock price is higher than the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, we will recognize excess tax benefits that will decrease oureffective tax rate. For example, in 2021, excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $1.13 billionand our effective tax rate by two percentage points as compared to the tax rate without such benefits. In future periods in which our stock price is lower than thegrant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, our effective tax rate may increase. The amount and value of share-based compensation issuedrelative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share-based compensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effectsare dependent on our stock price, which we do not control, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affectour financial results.If our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.We review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, such as adecline in stock price and market capitalization. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually. If such goodwill or intangible assetsare deemed to be impaired, an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized. Wemay be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill33Table of Contentsor intangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect our results of operations.The loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business.We currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl K. Sandberg. Although wehave entered into employment agreements with Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, the agreements have no specific duration and constitute at-will employment. Inaddition, many of our key technologies and systems are custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including members ofmanagement as well as key engineering, product development, marketing, and sales personnel, could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on ourbusiness.As we continue to grow, we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position. Inparticular, we intend to continue to hire a significant number of technical personnel in the foreseeable future, and we expect to continue to face significantchallenges in hiring such personnel, particularly for engineering talent, whether as a result of competition with other companies or other factors. As we continue tomature, the incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past,and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees or to retain our existing employees, we would incur substantial additional share-basedcompensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may also beadversely affected by stock price volatility. In addition, restrictive immigration policies or legal or regulatory developments relating to immigration may negativelyaffect our efforts to attract and hire new personnel as well as retain our existing personnel. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating excellentpersonnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow effectively.Our CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock.Mark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstandingcapital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and anymerger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger,consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in theconsummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiringour Class A common stock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common stock, and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock.In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our CEO andhis ability to control the election or, in some cases, the replacement of our directors. In the event of his death, the shares of our capital stock that Mr. Zuckerbergowns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated. As a board member and officer, Mr. Zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholdersand must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder,Mr. Zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control as governed by a voting agreement, in his own interests, which may notalways be in the interests of our stockholders generally.We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. Share repurchasescould also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves.Although our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date, the program does not obligate us torepurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of our Class A common stock. We cannot guarantee that the program will befully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. The program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and anyannouncement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this program will diminish our cash reserves.34Table of ContentsRisks Related to Government Regulation and EnforcementActions by governments that restrict access to Facebook or our other products in their countries, censor or moderate content on our products in theircountries, or otherwise impair our ability to sell advertising in their countries, could substantially harm our business and financial results.Governments from time to time seek to censor or moderate content available on Facebook or our other products in their country, restrict access to ourproducts from their country partially or entirely, or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended periodof time or indefinitely. For example, user access to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in China, Iran,and North Korea. In addition, government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of theirlaws or a threat to public safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries from time to time. Forexample, in June 2020, Hong Kong adopted a National Security Law that provides authorities with the ability to obtain information, remove and block access tocontent, and suspend user services, and if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted. In addition, if we are required toor elect to make changes to our marketing and sales or other operations in Hong Kong as a result of the National Security Law, our revenue and business in theregion will be adversely affected. It is also possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising, including in countrieswhere access to our consumer-facing products may be blocked or restricted. For example, we generate meaningful revenue from a limited number of resellersrepresenting advertisers based in China, and it is possible that the Chinese government could take action that reduces or eliminates our China-based advertisingrevenue, whether as a result of the trade dispute with the United States, in response to content issues or information requests in Hong Kong or elsewhere, or forother reasons, or take other action against us, such as imposing taxes or other penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results. Similarly, if we arefound to be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for social media companies in Turkey, the Turkish government could take action to reduce oreliminate our Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise adversely impact access to our products. In the event that content shown on Facebook or our otherproducts is subject to censorship, access to our products is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, we are required to or elect to make changes toour operations, or other restrictions are imposed on our products, or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greatershare of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our ability to retain or increase our user base, user engagement, orthe level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated, and our financial results couldbe adversely affected.Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use and data protection, content, competition,safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, andcould result in claims, changes to our products and business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth orengagement, or otherwise harm our business.We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including privacy, data use,data protection and personal information, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, datasecurity, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, artificial intelligence, electronic contracts and other communications,competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controlsincluding sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products,expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. Inaddition, foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, consumer protection, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be morerestrictive than those in the United States.These U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, areconstantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are oftenuncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country andinconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our usersor obtain consent to various practices could adversely affect user growth and engagement. Such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our servicesor adversely affect our financial results.35Table of ContentsWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receive certaindata that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. Forexample, in 2016, the European Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the United States, calledthe Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases uponwhich Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example, theCJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States following a challenge brought by the Irish DataProtection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, our continued reliance on SCCs will be the subject of futureregulatory consideration. In particular, in August 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from the IDPC that preliminarily concluded that Meta PlatformsIreland's reliance on SCCs in respect of European user data does not achieve compliance with the GDPR and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user datafrom the European Union to the United States should therefore be suspended. Meta Platforms Ireland challenged procedural aspects of this IDPC inquiry in ajudicial review commenced in the Irish High Court in September 2020. In May 2021, the court rejected Meta Platforms Ireland's procedural challenges and theinquiry subsequently recommenced. We believe a final decision in this inquiry may issue as early as the first half of 2022. If a new transatlantic data transferframework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on SCCs or rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from Europe to the United States,we will likely be unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially andadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we have been managing investigations and lawsuits in Europe, India, andother jurisdictions regarding the August 2016 update to WhatsApp's terms of service and privacy policy and its sharing of certain data with other Meta productsand services, including a lawsuit currently pending before the Supreme Court of India, and also became subject to government inquiries and lawsuits regarding the2021 update to WhatsApp's terms of service and privacy policy. If we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, orif we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide ourservices or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results.We have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments in the past, and proposed or new legislation and regulations couldsignificantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements under theEuropean General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of personal databreach notifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligationas well as other requirements of the regulation. The GDPR is still a relatively new law, its interpretation is still evolving, and draft decisions in investigations bythe IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes in thefinal outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulationsimposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act(CCPA), which took effect in January 2020, and its successor, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which will take effect in January 2023, also establishcertain transparency rules and create new data privacy rights for users, including limitations on our use of certain sensitive personal information and more abilityfor users to control how their data is shared with third parties. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on ouradvertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertisingbusiness. For example, regulators continue to issue guidance concerning the ePrivacy Directive's requirements regarding the use of cookies and similartechnologies. In addition, effective December 2020, the ePrivacy Directive includes additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products andincludes significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments may adversely affectour advertising business. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as wellas other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. For example, the proposed Digital Markets Act in theEuropean Union and pending proposals to modify competition laws in the United States and other jurisdictions could cause us to incur significant compliance costsand could potentially impose new restrictions and requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of data across services, mergersand acquisitions, and product design. In addition, some countries, such as India, are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protectionrequirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar36Table of Contentsrequirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services. New legislation or regulatory decisions that restrict our ability to collect anduse information about minors may also result in limitations on our advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certainjurisdictions.These laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any other government actions, have in the past led to, and may inthe future lead to, unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs, delays or impediments in the development of new products, negative publicity andreputational harm, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm our business, including fines or demands ororders that we modify or cease existing business practices.We have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and we expect to continue to be subject to suchproceedings and other inquiries in the future, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a mannermaterially adverse to our business.We receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations, many of whichare evolving and subject to interpretation. We are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information,actions, and audits in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer protection,civil rights, content moderation, and competition, as we continue to grow and expand our operations. In addition, we are currently, and may in the future be,subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees. For example, data protection, competition, and consumer protection authorities in the European Union and otherjurisdictions have initiated actions, investigations, or administrative orders seeking to restrict the ways in which we collect and use information, or imposesanctions, and other authorities may do the same. In addition, beginning in March 2018, we became subject to FTC, state attorneys general, and other governmentinquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by adeveloper that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order toresolve the FTC inquiry, which was approved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC required us topay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiry andcertain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing. Beginning in September 2018, we also became subject to IDPC and other government inquiriesin connection with a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile informationfrom user accounts on Facebook. We also notify the IDPC, our lead European Union privacy regulator under the GDPR, of certain other personal data breachesand privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatorycompliance.In addition, we are subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition authorities in the United States, Europe,and other jurisdictions, which relate to many aspects of our business, including with respect to users and advertisers, as well as our industry. Such inquiries,investigations, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, digital advertising,and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrustinvestigation of our company. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust inquiries and investigations by the U.S.Department of Justice and state attorneys general. Beginning in December 2020, we also became subject to lawsuits by the FTC and the attorneys general from46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we violated antitrust laws,including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform, among other things. The complaints ofthe FTC and attorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief,including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. We are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our businessactivities and disclosure practices. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to allegationsand the release of internal company documents by a former employee.Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose usto unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in amanner materially adverse to our business, result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from ourbusiness, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business, and we have experienced some of37Table of Contentsthese adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.Compliance with our FTC consent order, the GDPR, the CCPA, the ePrivacy Directive, and other regulatory and legislative privacy requirements requiresignificant operational resources and modifications to our business practices, and any compliance failures may have a material adverse effect on our business,reputation, and financial results.We are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with our modified consent order with the FTC, requirementsof the GDPR, and other regulatory and legislative requirements around the world, such as the CCPA and the ePrivacy Directive. In particular, we are maintaining acomprehensive privacy program in connection with the FTC consent order that includes substantial management and board of directors oversight, stringentoperational requirements and reporting obligations, prohibitions against making misrepresentations relating to user data, a process to regularly certify ourcompliance with the privacy program to the FTC, and regular assessments of our privacy program by an independent third-party assessor, which has been and willcontinue to be challenging and costly to maintain and enhance. These compliance and oversight efforts are increasing demand on our systems and resources, andrequire significant new and ongoing investments, including investments in compliance processes, personnel, and technical infrastructure. We are reallocatingresources internally to assist with these efforts, and this has had, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our other business initiatives. In addition, theseefforts require substantial modifications to our business practices and make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming,and costly. As a result, we believe our ability to develop and launch new features, products, and services in a timely manner has been and will continue to beadversely affected. We also expect that our privacy compliance and oversight efforts will require significant time and attention from our management and board ofdirectors. The requirements of the FTC consent order and other privacy-related laws and regulations are complex and apply broadly to our business, and from timeto time we notify relevant authorities of instances where we are not in full compliance with these requirements or otherwise discover privacy issues, and we expectto continue to do so as any such issues arise in the future. In addition, regulatory and legislative privacy requirements are constantly evolving and can be subject tosignificant change and uncertain interpretation. If we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the mandates of the FTC consent order, GDPR,CCPA, ePrivacy Directive, or other regulatory or legislative requirements, or if we are found to be in violation of the consent order or other applicablerequirements, we may be subject to regulatory or governmental investigations or lawsuits, which may result in significant monetary fines, judgments, or otherpenalties, and we may also be required to make additional changes to our business practices. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, reputation, and financial results.We may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our products or as a result of claims relatedto our products, and legislation regulating content on our platform may require us to change our products or business practices and may adversely affect ourbusiness and financial results.We have faced, currently face, and will continue to face claims relating to information or content that is published or made available on our products,including our policies and enforcement actions with respect to such information or content. In particular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related todefamation, dissemination of misinformation or news hoaxes, discrimination, harassment, intellectual property rights, rights of publicity and privacy, personalinjury torts, laws regulating hate speech or other types of content, online safety, consumer protection, and breach of contract, among others. This risk is enhancedin certain jurisdictions outside the United States where our protection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear or where we may be less protected underlocal laws than we are in the United States. For example, in April 2019, the European Union passed a directive (the European Copyright Directive) expandingonline platform liability for copyright infringement and regulating certain uses of news content online, which member states are currently implementing into theirnational laws. In addition, the European Union revised the European Audiovisual Media Service Directive to apply to online video-sharing platforms, whichmember states are expected to implement by 2021. In the United States, there have been, and continue to be, various legislative and executive efforts to remove orrestrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, as well as to impose new obligations ononline platforms with respect to commerce listings, user content, counterfeit goods and copyright-infringing material, and our current protections from liability forthird-party content in the United States could decrease or change. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are foundliable, significant damages. We could also face fines, orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies, or other government-imposed remediesas a result of content hosted on our services. For example, legislation in Germany and India has resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in the impositionof fines or other penalties for failure to comply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation, and disclosure obligations. Numerous other countries inEurope, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposing potentially significant penalties,including fines,38Table of Contentsservice throttling, or advertising bans, for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes. For example, we have been subject to fines andmay in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media legislation in Russia and Turkey. Content-related legislation also has required us inthe past, and may require us in the future, to change our products or business practices, increase our costs, or otherwise impact our operations or our ability toprovide services in certain geographies. For example, the European Copyright Directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations for copyrightedcontent or to implement measures to prevent the availability of that content, which may require us to make substantial investments in compliance processes.Member states' laws implementing the European Copyright Directive may also require online platforms to pay for content. In addition, our compliance costs maysignificantly increase as a result of the Digital Services Act proposed in the European Union, which is expected to take effect in 2023, and other content-relatedlegislative developments such as online safety bills in Ireland and the United Kingdom. In the United States, changes to Section 230 of the CommunicationsDecency Act or new state or federal content-related legislation may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, oroperations, which could adversely affect user growth and engagement. Any of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and financial results.Payment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harmour business.Several of our products offer Payments functionality, including enabling our users to purchase virtual and digital goods from developers that offerapplications using our Payments infrastructure, send money to other users, and make donations to certain charitable organizations, among other activities. We aresubject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, including those governing anti-money laundering and counter-terroristfinancing, money transmission, stored value, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfer, virtual currency, consumer protection,charitable fundraising, trade sanctions, and import and export restrictions. Depending on how our Payments products evolve, we may also be subject to other lawsand regulations including those governing gambling, banking, and lending. In some jurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations isnot clear. To increase flexibility in how our use of Payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty, we have received certain payments licenses in theUnited States, the European Economic Area, and other jurisdictions, which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreignlaws in these areas. Our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still notguarantee compliance. In the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements, we may be subject to monetary fines or otherpenalties such as a cease and desist order, or we may be required to make product changes, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financialresults.In addition, we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of Payments transactions, including: increased costs and diversion of management timeand effort and other resources to deal with bad transactions or customer disputes; potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users, developers, employees,or third parties; restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact Payments; and additional disclosure and reporting requirements. We have alsolaunched certain payments functionality on WhatsApp and have announced plans to develop digital payments products and services, which may subject us to manyof the foregoing risks and additional licensing requirements.Our digital payments initiatives subject us to significant regulatory scrutiny and other risks that could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financialresults.We are pursuing digital payments initiatives, such as Novi, a digital wallet that we expect to offer as both a standalone application and subsequentlyintegrated in other Meta products. These initiatives may use blockchain-based assets, such as the USDP stablecoin issued by Paxos Trust Company, which is beingused in a Novi pilot program in the United States and Guatemala beginning in October 2021. Our future initiatives to support commerce in the metaverse also mayuse blockchain-based assets in digital payments. Use of blockchain-based assets in payments are a relatively new and unproven technology, and the laws andregulations surrounding them are uncertain and evolving. These digital payments efforts have drawn significant scrutiny from governments and regulators inmultiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue. We are participating in responses to inquiries from governments and regulators related to our digitalpayments initiatives, and adverse government or regulatory actions or negative publicity resulting from such participation may adversely affect our reputation andharm our business.As our digital payments initiatives evolve, we may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions,including those governing payments, financial services, virtual currency, anti-money39Table of Contentslaundering, counter-terrorism financing, trade sanctions, data protection, tax, consumer protection, and competition. In many jurisdictions, the application orinterpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear, particularly with respect to evolving laws and regulations that are applied to blockchain and digitalpayments. In addition, Novi has also received state money transmitter licenses in the United States, with more pending approval, and has other financial serviceslicense applications pending in certain other countries that would allow us to conduct digital wallet activities in those countries. These licenses, laws, andregulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations, may delay or impede the development of digital payments products and services we offer, increaseour operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business.In addition, market acceptance of digital payments products and services is subject to significant uncertainty. As such, there can be no assurance that digitalpayments products and services we offer will be made available in a timely manner, or at all. We do not have significant prior experience with blockchain-basedtechnology, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market such digital payments products and services. We will also incur increasedcosts in connection with these efforts, and our investments may not be successful. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financialresults.Risks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual PropertySecurity breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, or other cyber incidents couldharm our reputation and adversely affect our business.Our industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users' data or to disrupt our ability to provide service. Ourproducts and services involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of a large amount of data. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breachesand improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, including personal information, content, or payment information from users, or information frommarketers, could result in the loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, or other misuse of such data, which could harm our business and reputation and diminishour competitive position. In addition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (such as spear phishing attacks), scraping, and general hacking continue to beprevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems in the past, and will occur on our systems in the future. We also regularly encounter attempts to create falseor undesirable user accounts, purchase ads, or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming, spreading misinformation, or other objectionableends. As a result of our prominence, the size of our user base, the types and volume of personal data and content on our systems, and the evolving nature of ourproducts and services (including our efforts involving new and emerging technologies), we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches andattacks, including from nation states and highly sophisticated, state-sponsored, or otherwise well-funded actors. Our efforts to address undesirable activity on ourplatform also increase the risk of retaliatory attacks. Such breaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide, degrade the user experience,cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products, impair our internal systems, or result in financial harm to us. Our efforts to protect ourcompany data or the information we receive, and to disable undesirable activities on our platform, may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technicalmalfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance, including defects or vulnerabilities in our vendors' information technology systems orofferings; government surveillance; breaches of physical security of our facilities or technical infrastructure; or other threats that evolve. In addition, third partiesmay attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users' data. Cyber-attacks continue toevolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we have developed systems and processes that aredesigned to protect our data and user data, to prevent data loss, to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform, and to prevent or detect securitybreaches, we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security, that we will be able to react in a timely manner, or that our remediation effortswill be successful. The changes in our work environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could also impact the security of our systems, as well as ourability to protect against attacks and detect and respond to them quickly.In addition, some of our developers or other partners, such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads, may receive or store information providedby us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with our products. We provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope ofservices provided to us. However, if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of theirnetworks, our data or our users' data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed.We experience such cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time, and we incur40Table of Contentssignificant costs in protecting against or remediating such incidents. In addition, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroadrelating to cybersecurity and data protection, as well as obligations under our modified consent order with the FTC. As a result, affected users or governmentauthorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches or improper access to or disclosure ofdata, which has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modifyour business practices. Such incidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may also result in a decline in our active user base or engagement levels. Any ofthese events could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, or financial results.For example, in September 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal useraccess tokens, which were then used to access certain profile information from approximately 29 million user accounts on Facebook. The events surrounding thiscyber-attack became the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission and other government inquiries. Any such inquiries could subject us to substantial fines andcosts, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.We anticipate that our ongoing efforts related to privacy, safety, security, and content review will identify additional instances of misuse of user data or otherundesirable activity by third parties on our platform.In addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks, we are making significant investments in privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts tocombat misuse of our services and user data by third parties, including investigations and audits of platform applications, as well as other enforcement efforts. As aresult of these efforts we have discovered and announced, and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce, additional incidents of misuse of user dataor other undesirable activity by third parties. We may not discover all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data or technical limitations, includingour lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, challenges related to our personnel working remotely during the COVID-19pandemic, the allocation of resources to other projects, or other factors, and we may be notified of such incidents or activity by the independent privacy assessorrequired under our modified consent order with the FTC, the media, or other third parties. Such incidents and activities have in the past, and may in the future,include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts,election interference, improper advertising practices, activities that threaten people's safety on- or offline, or instances of spamming, scraping, data harvesting,unsecured datasets, or spreading misinformation. We may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate any such incidents.Consequences of any of the foregoing developments include negative effects on user trust and engagement, harm to our reputation and brands, changes to ourbusiness practices in a manner adverse to our business, and adverse effects on our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us toadditional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could subject us to monetary penalties and damages, divert management's time and attention, and lead toenhanced regulatory oversight.Our products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities in these systems, or failuresto address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems, could adversely affect our business.Our products and internal systems rely on software and hardware, including software and hardware developed or maintained internally and/or by thirdparties, that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store, retrieve,process, and manage immense amounts of data. The software and hardware on which we rely has contained, and will in the future contain, errors, bugs, orvulnerabilities, and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise our ability to meet our objectives. Some errors, bugs, orvulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. For example, inSeptember 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens and accesscertain profile information from user accounts on Facebook. Errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, design defects, or technical limitations within the software and hardwareon which we rely, or human error in using such systems, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including a negative experience for usersand marketers who use our products, compromised ability of our products to perform in a manner consistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, delayed productintroductions or enhancements, targeting, measurement, or billing errors, compromised ability to protect the data of our users and/or our intellectual property orother data, or reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services. For example, we make41Table of Contentscommitments to our users as to how their data will be used within and across our products, and our systems are subject to errors, bugs and technical limitations thatmay prevent us from fulfilling these commitments reliably. In addition, any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects in our systems or the software and hardware onwhich we rely, failures to properly address or mitigate the technical limitations in our systems, or associated degradations or interruptions of service or failures tofulfill our commitments to our users, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss ofmarketers, loss of revenue, regulatory inquiries, litigation, or liability for fines, damages, or other remedies, any of which could adversely affect our business andfinancial results.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adverselyaffected.We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and thirdparties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights.In the United States and internationally, we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property, and we currently hold asignificant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties. Thirdparties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future trademarkand patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate orintend to operate our business. In any or all of these cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or toenforce our rights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that others will not offer products orconcepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. In addition, we regularly contribute software source code under open source licensesand have made other technology we developed available under other open licenses, and we include open source software in our products. As a result of our opensource contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to license or disclose code and/or innovations that turn out to bematerial to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use orappropriation by third parties, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic ourproducts, services, and methods of operations. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.We are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consumingand, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.Companies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and frequently enterinto litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various "non-practicing entities" that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technologycompanies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas where we historically have not competed, which couldincrease our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and non-practicing entities.From time to time, we receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and services, or user content, infringe theirintellectual property rights. We presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasinglyhigh profile, we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow. Defending patent and other intellectual property litigation iscostly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in allcases. In addition, plaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation, including potentialpreliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations. We may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us.Similarly, if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. Theterms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, we mayhave to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party's rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and maysignificantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or42Table of Contentspractices or discontinue the practices. The development of alternative non-infringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense, couldresult in less effective technology or practices or otherwise negatively affect the user experience, or may not be feasible. We have experienced unfavorableoutcomes in such disputes and litigation in the past, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of anunfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common StockThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.The trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our Class A common stock were sold inour initial public offering in May 2012 at a price of $38.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from $17.55 to $384.33 through December 31, 2021. In addition tothe factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our Class A common stock has in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuatesignificantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results for either of our reportable segments;•the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet these projections;•actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company,or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;•additional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us, our existing stockholders, or in connection with acquisitions, or the anticipation of suchsales;•investor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, orcapital commitments;•announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base, the level of user engagement, or theeffectiveness of our ad products;•changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry, including our developers and competitors;•price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;•the inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&P 500 Index;•media coverage of our business and financial performance;•lawsuits threatened or filed against us, or developments in pending lawsuits;•adverse government actions or legislative or regulatory developments relating to advertising, competition, content, privacy, or other matters, includinginterim or final rulings by tax, judicial, or regulatory bodies;•trading activity in our share repurchase program; and•other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, and other disruptive external events, or responses to theseevents.In addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equitysecurities of many technology companies. We are currently subject to securities litigation43Table of Contentsin connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of ourterms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; and a former employee's allegations and release of internal companydocuments beginning in September 2021. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. Any securities litigation could subject usto substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.We do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansionof our business and fund our share repurchase program, and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you mayonly receive a return on your investment in our Class A common stock if the trading price of your shares increases.The dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control with ourCEO and certain other holders of our Class B common stock; this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters.Our Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Stockholders who hold shares of Class Bcommon stock, including certain of our executive officers, employees, and directors and their affiliates, together hold a substantial majority of the voting power ofour outstanding capital stock. Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stockcollectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders forapproval so long as the shares of Class B common stock represent at least 9.1% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. Thisconcentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.Transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, suchas certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect,over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example,Mr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, continue to control amajority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock.Our status as a "controlled company" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.Because we qualify as a "controlled company" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, we are not required to have a majority ofour board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. In the future we could electnot to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. Accordingly,should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded tostockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could makeour Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing thetrading price of our Class A common stock.Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a changein control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes aninterested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our current certificate of incorporation and bylawscontain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:•until the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the combined voting power of our commonstock, any transaction that would result in a change in control of our44Table of Contentscompany requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class;•we currently have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mr. Zuckerberg with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiringstockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;•when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock, certainamendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval of two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares ofClass A and Class B common stock;•when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, vacancieson our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;•when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, our boardof directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors will only be able to be removed from office forcause;•when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, ourstockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;•only our chairman, our chief executive officer, our president, or a majority of our board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting ofstockholders;•advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting ofstockholders;•our certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established, and shares of which may be issued,without stockholder approval; and•certain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware.45Table of ContentsItem 1B.Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2.PropertiesOur corporate headquarters are located in Menlo Park, California. As of December 31, 2021, we owned and leased approximately 10 million square feet ofoffice and building space for our corporate headquarters and in the surrounding areas, and approximately 69 acres of land to be developed to accommodateanticipated future growth.In addition, we have offices in more than 80 cities across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, and Latin America. We also own18 data centers globally.We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs.Item 3.Legal ProceedingsBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhereagainst us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection withour platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms andpolicies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the UnitedStates against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for thesecond quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for theNorthern District of California with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25, 2019, thedistrict court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to amend. On November 15, 2019, a second amendedcomplaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. On August 7, 2020, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the second amendedcomplaint, with leave to amend. On October 16, 2020, a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. On December 20,2021, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint, with prejudice. On January 17, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal ofthe order dismissing their case. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer,became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and otherjurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and required us to pay a penaltyof $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiry and certaingovernment inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing and could subject us to additional substantial fines and costs, require us to change our businesspractices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative actionwas filed in Delaware Chancery Court against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historicalplatform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a relatedDelaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of our current and former directors and officers in connectionwith our historical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in thestockholder derivative action. We believe the lawsuits described above are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.We also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulatorsregarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. For example, in August 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from the IDPC that preliminarilyconcluded that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses in respect of European user data does not achieve compliance with the GDPRand preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the European Union to the United States should therefore be suspended. Meta Platforms Irelandchallenged procedural aspects of this IDPC inquiry in a judicial review commenced in the Irish High Court in September 2020. On May 14, 2021, the courtrejected Meta Platforms Ireland's procedural challenges, and the inquiry subsequently recommenced. We believe a final decision in this46Table of Contentsinquiry may issue as early as the first half of 2022. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors—Our business is subject to complex and evolvingU.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use and data protection, content, competition, safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, and othermatters" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any such inquiries or investigations could subject us to substantial fines and costs, require us to change our businesspractices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.In addition, we are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competition authorities in the UnitedStates, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of socialnetworking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we wereinformed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint against us in the U.S. DistrictCourt for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the FederalTrade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions onaccess to our platform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice andstate attorneys general. On December 9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia filed a complaint against usin the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, includingby acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The complaint also alleged that we violatedSection 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The complaints of the FTC and attorneys general both sought a permanent injunction againstour company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28,2021, the court granted our motions to dismiss the complaints filed by the FTC and attorneys general, dismissing the FTC's complaint with leave to amend anddismissing the attorneys general's case without prejudice. On July 28, 2021, the attorneys general filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case. OnAugust 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, thecourt denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint. Multiple putative class actions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the UnitedStates against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and other alleged anticompetitive conduct,and seeking damages and unspecified injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users were consolidated in the U.S. DistrictCourt for the Northern District of California. On January 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions.We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. The result of such litigation, investigations or inquiries could subject us tosubstantial monetary remedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from ourbusiness, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.We are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices. For example, beginning inSeptember 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal companydocuments concerning, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as misinformation and otherundesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. Beginning on October 27, 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed in federal court in the UnitedStates against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the same matters. We believe these lawsuits arewithout merit, and we are vigorously defending them.In addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory agencies, including in particular in Brazil,Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including ourobligation to disclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and penalties against us.We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such finesand penalties.We are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary courseof business, and we may in the future be subject to additional legal proceedings and disputes.Item 4.Mine Safety DisclosuresNot applicable.47Table of ContentsPART IIItem 5.Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesMarket Information for Common StockOur Class A common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol "FB" since May 18, 2012. Prior to that time, there was nopublic market for our stock. We expect our Class A common stock to cease trading under the symbol "FB" and begin trading under the new symbol, "META," onthe Nasdaq Global Select Market in the first half of 2022.Our Class B common stock is not listed on any stock exchange nor traded on any public market.Holders of RecordAs of December 31, 2021, there were 3,258 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock, and the closing price of our Class A common stock was$336.35 per share as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Because many of our shares of Class A common stock are held by brokers and other institutionson behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders. As of December 31, 2021, there were32 stockholders of record of our Class B common stock.Dividend PolicyWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock.

In addition to our historicalconsolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual resultscould differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussedbelow and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors." For a discussion of limitations in the measurement ofcertain of our community metrics, see the section entitled "Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in theUnited States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constant currency basis and free cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Revenue on a constantcurrency basis is presented in the section entitled "—Revenue—Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue." To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, wetranslated revenue for the full year 2021 using 2020 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For a fulldescription of our free cash flow non-GAAP measure, see the section entitled "—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Free Cash Flow."These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared andpresented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non‑GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness forcomparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors shouldbe cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financialmeasures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results betweenperiods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management inoperating our business.Executive Overview of Full Year 2021 ResultsOur key community metrics and financial results for 2021 are as follows:Family of Apps metrics:•Family daily active people (DAP) was 2.82 billion on average for December 2021, an increase of 8% year-over-year.•Family monthly active people (MAP) was 3.59 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of 9% year-over-year.•Facebook daily active users (DAUs) were 1.93 billion on average for December 2021, an increase of 5% year-over-year.•Facebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 2.91 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of 4% year-over-year.•Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased by 10% year-over-year in 2021, and the average price per ad increased by 24% year-over-year in 2021.50Table of ContentsConsolidated and segment results:Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, we report our financial results based on two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL).FoA includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other services.

All of our products, including our apps, share the vision ofhelping to bring the metaverse to life.In 2021, we continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities: (i) helping marketers use our products to connect with consumers where they are and(ii) making our ads more relevant and effective. We also continued to invest based on the following company priorities: (i) continue making progress on the majorsocial issues facing the internet and our company, including privacy, safety, and security; (ii) build new experiences that meaningfully improve people's lives todayand set the stage for even bigger improvements in the future; (iii) keep building our business by supporting the millions of businesses that rely on our services togrow and create jobs; and (iv) communicate more transparently about what we're doing and the role our services play in the world.Our advertising revenue growth in the second half of 2021 was adversely affected by reduced marketer spending as a result of limitations on our adtargeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the iOS operating system. We expect that future advertising revenue growth will continue to be adverselyaffected by these and other limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobileoperating systems and browsers.Our business and results of operations have also been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the preventative measures implemented by authorities fromtime to time to help limit the spread of the illness, which have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in certain affected countriesand regions. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, we experienced significant increases in the size and engagement of our active user base across a number ofregions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. More recently, we have seen these pandemic-related trends subside, particularly in certain developed markets. Weare unable to predict the impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty and these trends may continue to be subject to volatility.The COVID-19 pandemic has also had a varied impact on the demand for and pricing of our ads from period to period. While we experienced a reduction indemand and a related decline in pricing during the onset of the pandemic, we believe the pandemic subsequently contributed to an acceleration in the growth ofonline commerce, particularly during the second half of 2020, and we experienced increasing demand for advertising as a result of this trend. More recently, webelieve this growth has moderated in many regions, which to some extent adversely affected our advertising revenue growth in the second half of 2021. We mayexperience reduced advertising demand and related declines in pricing in future periods to the extent this trend continues, which could adversely affect ouradvertising revenue growth. However, the impact of the51Table of Contentspandemic on user growth and engagement, the demand for and pricing of our advertising services, as well as on our overall results of operations, remains highlyuncertain for the foreseeable future.User growth and engagement were also impacted by a number of other factors in the second half of 2021. For example, competitive products and serviceshave reduced some users' engagement with our products and services, and in response to competitive pressures, we have introduced new features such as Reels,which is growing in usage but is not currently monetized at the same rate as our feed or Stories products. We also saw a deceleration in our community growthrates as the size of our community continued to increase. In addition, we experienced year-over-year declines in ad impressions delivered in the United States &Canada region. These trends adversely affected advertising revenue growth in the second half of 2021 and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenuegrowth in the foreseeable future. Other global and regional business and macroeconomic conditions also have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impacton our user growth and engagement and advertising revenue growth.We anticipate that additional investments in our data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities, as well as scaling our headcount tosupport our growth, including in our Reality Labs initiatives, will continue to drive expense growth in 2022. We expect 2022 capital expenditures to be in the rangeof $29-34 billion and total expenses to be in the range of $90-95 billion. In 2022, we also expect that our year-over-year total expense growth rates maysignificantly exceed our year-over-year revenue growth rates, which would adversely affect our operating margin and profitability.52Table of ContentsTrends in Our Family MetricsThe numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users on our other products unless theywould otherwise qualify as DAP or MAP, respectively, based on their other activities on our Family products.Trends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value ofour ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly activepeople (as defined below) access our Family products on mobile devices.•Daily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp(collectively, our "Family" of products) who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobilebrowser on a given day. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and thereforemust seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques,algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including bymatching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and countingsuch group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limitedsamples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP, and DAPas a percentage of MAP, as measures of engagement across our products.

While we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of ourworldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of uniquepeople using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For additional information, see the section entitled "Limitations ofKey Metrics and Other Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the second quarter of 2020, we updated our Family metrics calculations to reflect recent data from a periodicWhatsApp user survey and to incorporate certain methodology improvements, and we estimate such updates contributed an aggregate of approximately 40 million DAP to our reportedworldwide DAP in June 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, and weestimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 60 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in March 2021.Worldwide DAP increased 8% to 2.82 billion on average during December 2021 from 2.60 billion during December 2020.53Table of Contents•Monthly Active People (MAP).

We define ARPP as our total revenue during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAP at thebeginning and end of the quarter.

Users in India, Bangladesh, andVietnam represented the top three sources of growth in DAUs during December 2021, relative to the same period in 2020.•Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through our websiteor a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUsare a measure of the size of our global active user community on Facebook.  As of December 31, 2021, we had 2.91 billion MAUs, an increase of 4% from December 31, 2020. Users in India, Vietnam, and Bangladesh representedthe top three sources of growth in 2021, relative to the same period in 2020.57Table of ContentsTrends in Our Monetization by Facebook User GeographyWe calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods arepurchased, or consumer hardware products are shipped. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by the averageof the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs used in thiscalculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above. While the share of revenue from users who are not alsoFacebook or Messenger MAUs has grown over time, we estimate that revenue from users who are Facebook or Messenger MAUs represents the substantialmajority of our total revenue. See "Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP)" above for our estimates of trends in our monetization of our Family products. Thegeography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates. Ourrevenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobileadvertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2021 in the United States & Canada region was more than 12 times higher than in the Asia-Pacific region.ARPU:$8.52 $6.95 $7.05 $7.89 $10.14 $9.27 $10.12 $10.00 $11.57  ARPU:$41.41 $34.18 $36.49 $39.63 $53.56 $48.03 $53.01 $52.34 $60.57 ARPU:$13.21$10.64$11.03$12.41$16.87$15.49$17.23$16.50 $19.68  ARPU:$3.57$3.06$2.99$3.67$4.05$3.94$4.16$4.30$4.89ARPU:$2.48$1.99$1.78$2.22$2.77$2.64$3.05$3.14$3.43Note: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA Other revenue, which consists of net fees we receive fromdevelopers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from various other sources.58Table of ContentsOur revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in Note 2 — Revenue in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II,Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplemental Data" where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the addresses of our customers.Our annual worldwide ARPU in 2021, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPU during such period, was $40.96, an increase of 28% from 2020. For2021, ARPU increased by 40% in Rest of World, 35% in Europe, 31% in the United States & Canada, and 26% in Asia‑Pacific, as compared with 2020. Inaddition, user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia‑Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the futurewill be primarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative toARPU in any geographic region, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region.59Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us tomake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis,we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under thecircumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgmentnecessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on ourconsolidated financial statements is material. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with gross vs. net in revenue recognition, valuation ofequity investments, income taxes, loss contingencies, and valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment, andtheir associated estimated useful lives, when applicable, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these tobe our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 — Summary of SignificantAccounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" ofthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.Gross vs. Net in Revenue RecognitionFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third parties, there is significant judgment in evaluating whether we are the principal, and reportrevenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or servicesbefore they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion inestablishing price. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact our revenue and cost of revenue recognizedon the consolidated statements of income.Valuation of Equity InvestmentsFor our equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative, determining whether an equity securityissued by the same issuer is similar to the equity security we hold may require judgment in (a) assessment of differences in rights and obligations associated withthe instruments such as voting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion features, and (b) adjustments to the observable price for differences suchas, but not limited to, rights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or most advantageous markets. In addition, the identification of observabletransactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our investee companies, which may occur in a period subsequent to when thetransactions take place. Therefore, our fair value adjustment for these observable transactions may occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction actuallyoccurred. For equity investments, we perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. Thequalitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance;regulatory, economic or technological environment; operational and financing cash flows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. Whenindicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value of our equity investments using the market approach and/or the income approach and recognizeimpairment loss in the consolidated statements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. Estimating fair value requires judgment and useof estimates such as discount rates, forecast cash flows, holding period, and market data of comparable companies, among others.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision forincome taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examinationby the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have beendeveloped based upon analyses of appropriate60Table of Contentsarms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research and development tax credits are based on an assessment ofwhether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we haveadequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matterswill not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstanceschange, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amountsrecorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on ourfinancial condition and operating results.Loss ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business.Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with variouslegal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Therequirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and anyfailure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, weevaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amountcan be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, wedisclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters andrelated reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of ourdefenses and the impact of negotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment isrequired to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted andunasserted matters. Certain factors, in particular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on updatedinformation available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be the result of new laws and preliminary interpretationsregarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it difficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted against us.In addition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, are subject to review byother regulatory bodies before decisions are finalized, which can lead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, wereasonably expect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be revised in future quarters.The ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable or if and when the reasonablypossible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess ofmanagement's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomesprobable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. See Note 11 — Commitments and Contingencies and Note 14 — Income Taxes of theaccompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and Part I, Item 3, "LegalProceedings" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.Valuation of Long-lived Assets including Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Property and Equipment and Estimated Useful LivesWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on theirestimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill toreporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions,especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated replacement costs andfuture expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, acquired patents, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, anddiscount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based61Table of Contentsupon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortizedover the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceedone year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon theconclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than notreduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We have two reporting units subject to goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31, 2021, noimpairment of goodwill has been identified.Long-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events orcircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cashflows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amountsto the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount ofproperty and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any materialimpairment charges during the years presented.The useful lives of our long-lived assets including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are determined by management when thoseassets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. The current estimate of useful lives represents our best estimatebased on current facts and circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as changes to our businessoperations, changes in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, theremaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life.In connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, we extended the estimated average useful lives of ourserver and network assets category. The effect of the 2021 change was a reduction in depreciation expense of $620 million and an increase in net income of$516 million, or $0.18 per diluted share. The impact from the changes in our estimates was calculated based on the asset bases existing as of the effective dates ofthe changes and applying the revised useful lives prospectively. See Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes toconsolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additionalinformation regarding changes in the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment.62Table of ContentsComponents of Results of OperationsRevenueFamily of Apps (FoA)Advertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook,Instagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships withadvertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users.We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considereddelivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketercontracted for. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products.We calculate price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketerregardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on anet basis.Other revenue. Other revenue consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from various other sources.Reality Labs (RL)RL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, Facebook Portal, and wearables, and related software andcontent.Cost of Revenue and Operating ExpensesCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expensesrelated to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well aspayroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenuealso includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processing customertransactions; RL cost of products sold; and content costs.Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses which include share-basedcompensation, facilities-related costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for developing new products as well as improvingexisting products, and professional services.Marketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of marketing and promotional expenses and payroll and related expenses whichinclude share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions. Ourmarketing and sales expenses also include professional services such as content reviewers to support our community and product operations.General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of legal-related costs, which include accruals for estimated fines,settlements, or other losses in connection with legal and related matters, as well as other legal fees; payroll and related expenses which include share-basedcompensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrativeemployees; other taxes, such as digital services taxes, other tax levies, and gross receipts taxes; and professional services.63Table of ContentsResults of OperationsIn this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.

The increase was mostly driven by an increase in advertising revenue.AdvertisingAdvertising revenue in 2021 increased $30.76 billion, or 37%, compared to 2020 as a result of increases in both the average price per ad and the number ofads delivered. In 2021, the average price per ad increased by 24%, as compared with a decrease of approximately 10% in 2020. The increase in average price perad in 2021 was mainly caused by a recovery from declines in advertising demand in the first two quarters of 2020, due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.Additionally, overall advertising demand increased, as compared to 2020, across our ad products and in all regions in part due to the continued growth of onlinecommerce. In 2021, the number of ads delivered increased by 10%, as compared with an approximate 34% increase in 2020. The increase in the ads delivered in2021 was driven by increases in users and the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products. We anticipate that future advertising revenue growthwill be driven by a combination of price and the number of ads delivered.(1)65Table of ContentsReality LabsRL revenue increased $1.14 billion, or 100%, from 2020 to 2021, and $638 million, or 127%, from 2019 to 2020. The increases in both periods were mostlydriven by increases in the volume of our consumer hardware products sold.Revenue Seasonality and Customer ConcentrationRevenue is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. We believe that this seasonality in bothadvertising revenue and RL consumer hardware sales affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the third andfourth quarters and a decline between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our total revenue increased 16%, 31%, and 19% between the third andfourth quarters of 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, while total revenue for the first quarters of 2021, 2020, and 2019 declined 7%, 16%, and 11% compared tothe fourth quarters of 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We note the decline in total revenue in the first quarter of 2020 was exacerbated by the non-seasonalimpact of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.Foreign Exchange Impact on RevenueThe general weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 had a favorableimpact on revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2021 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies otherthan the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $116.29 billion and $113.31 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, totalrevenue and advertising revenue would have been $1.64 billion and $1.62 billion lower than actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the fullyear 2021. Using the same constant rates, full year 2021 total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $30.32 billion and $29.15 billion, respectively,higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2020.Cost of revenueYear Ended December 31,2021202020192021 vs 2020 %Change2020 vs 2019 %Change(dollars in millions)Cost of revenue$22,649 $16,692 $12,770 36 %31%Percentage of revenue19%19%18%Cost of revenue in 2021 increased $5.96 billion, or 36%, compared to 2020. The majority of the increase was due to an increase in Reality Labs cost ofproducts sold and an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, partially offset by a decrease in the depreciationgrowth rate mostly due to increases in the useful lives of servers and network assets. To a lesser extent, costs associated with partner arrangements, includingtraffic acquisition and payment processing costs, also increased.See Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this AnnualReport on Form 10-K for additional information regarding changes in the estimated useful lives of our servers and network assets.In 2022, we anticipate that cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support usergrowth and engagement and the delivery of new products and services, and, to a lesser extent, due to higher content costs.66Table of ContentsResearch and developmentYear Ended December 31,2021202020192021 vs 2020 %Change2020 vs 2019 %Change(dollars in millions)Research and development$24,655 $18,447 $13,600 34 %36 %Percentage of revenue21%21%19% Research and development expenses in 2021 increased $6.21 billion, or 34%, compared to 2020.

As a result, we recorded a total of $1.07 billion income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020.Effective Tax Rate Items. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the following items and income before provision forincome taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income, tax effects from share-based compensation, tax effects of integrating intellectual propertyfrom acquisitions, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the effects of changes in tax law.The accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-basedcompensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return, which depend upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock priceremains constant to the January 28, 2022 price, and absent U.S. tax legislation changes and other one-time events, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year2022 to be similar to the effective tax rate for the full year 2021. This includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research anddevelopment expenses starting in 2022, as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The mandatory capitalization requirement increases our cash taxliabilities but also decreases our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the mandatory capitalization requirement isdeferred, our effective tax rate in 2022 could be a few percentage points higher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities could be several billiondollars lower.Integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing ourprovision for income taxes. Consequently, our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition andintegration. The magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relativecontribution to income in subsequent periods.See Note 14 — Income Taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding income tax contingencies.69Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. Cash and cash equivalentsand marketable securities consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, investments in U.S. government securities, U.S.government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $48.0 billion as ofDecember 31, 2021, a decrease of $13.96 billion from December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily due to $44.54 billion for repurchases of our Class Acommon stock, $19.24 billion for capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, and $5.51 billion of taxes paid related to net sharesettlement of employee restricted stock units (RSU) awards, offset by $57.68 billion of cash generated from operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.Cash paid for income taxes was $8.52 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, our federal net operating loss carryforwardwas $10.61 billion and our federal tax credit carryforward was $527 million. We anticipate the utilization of a significant portion of these net operating losses andcredits within the next two years.Our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have anexpiration date. In 2021, we repurchased and subsequently retired 136 million shares of our Class A common stock for $44.81 billion. As of December 31, 2021,$38.79 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases.As of December 31, 2021, $10.61 billion of the $48.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries.The Tax Act imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminated U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions. As a result,earnings in foreign jurisdictions are available for distribution to the U.S. without incremental U.S. taxes.We currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our sharerepurchase program for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.The following table presents our cash flows (in millions):Year Ended December 31,202120202019Net cash provided by operating activities$57,683 $38,747 $36,314 Net cash used in investing activities$(7,570)$(30,059)$(19,864)Net cash used in financing activities$(50,728)$(10,292)$(7,299)Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities during 2021 mostly consisted of $39.37 billion net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including $9.16 billionof share-based compensation expense and $7.97 billion of depreciation and amortization. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2021 comparedto 2020 was primarily due to higher net income as adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expense and deferred income taxes,partially offset by changes in working capital.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities during 2021 primarily consisted of $18.57 billion of purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest in datacenters, servers, office facilities, and network infrastructure offset by $12.18 billion of net sales and maturities of marketable securities. The decrease in cash usedin investing activities during 2021 compared to 2020 was mostly due to decreases in net purchases of marketable securities and equity investments, partially offsetby an increase in purchases of property and equipment.We anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $29 billion to $34 billion in 2022.70Table of ContentsCash Used in Financing ActivitiesCash used in financing activities during 2021 mostly consisted of $44.54 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock and $5.51 billion of taxespaid related to net share settlement of RSUs. The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2021 compared to 2020 was mostly due to the increase inrepurchases of our Class A common stock.Free Cash FlowIn addition to other financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we monitor free cash flow (FCF) as a non-GAAP measure to manage ourbusiness, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance, and allocate resources. We define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by netpurchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases.We believe that FCF is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and provides useful information regarding howcash provided by operating activities compares to the property and equipment investments required to maintain and grow our business.We have chosen our definition for FCF because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors betterunderstand underlying trends in our business. We use FCF in discussions with our senior management and board of directors.FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such asnet cash provided by operating activities. FCF is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses. Some of the limitations ofFCF are:•FCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments; and•other companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.Management compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the FCF measure through disclosure of such limitations, presentation of ourfinancial statements in accordance with GAAP, and reconciliation of FCF to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operatingactivities, as presented below.The following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities (in millions):Year Ended December 31,202120202019Net cash provided by operating activities$57,683 $38,747 $36,314 Less: Purchases of property and equipment(18,567)(15,115)(15,102)Less: Principal payments on finance leases(677)(604)(552)Free cash flow$38,439 $23,028 $20,660 Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2021, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on ourfinancial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.71Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsOur principal commitments consist mostly of obligations under operating leases and other contractual commitments. Our operating lease obligations mostlyinclude among others, certain of our offices, data centers, colocations and land. Our other contractual commitments are primarily related to our investments inservers, network infrastructure and Reality Labs. The following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of December 31,2021 (in millions):Payment Due by Period Total20222023-20242025-2026ThereafterOperating lease obligations, including imputed interest$25,410 $1,559 $3,966 $3,837 $16,048 Finance lease obligations, including imputed interest2,303 678 603 322 700 Transition tax payable1,537 — 848 689 — Other contractual commitments23,080 14,502 5,426 609 2,543 Total contractual obligations$52,330 $16,739 $10,843 $5,457 $19,291 _________________________(1)Includes variable lease payments that were fixed subsequent to lease commencement or modification.Additionally, as part of the normal course of business, we may also enter into multi-year agreements to purchase renewable energy that do not specify afixed or minimum volume commitment or to purchase certain server components that do not specify a fixed or minimum price commitment. These agreements aregenerally entered into in order to secure either volume or price. Using projected market prices or expected volume consumption, the total estimated spend isapproximately $8.06 billion. The ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on prevailing market prices or actual volume purchased.Our other liabilities also include $4.40 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2021. Due to uncertainties in the timing of thecompletion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing ofpayments in individual years beyond 12 months. As a result, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table.ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We record a liability when we believe that it isboth probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we mayincur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to theextent material. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable andsubject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it couldhave a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.See Note 11 — Commitments and Contingencies and Note 14 — Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II,Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and Part I, Item 3, "Legal Proceedings" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional informationregarding contingencies.Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsFor further information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanyingnotes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.(1)(1)72Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity investment risk.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro.Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, have in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our revenueand other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars.We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing monetaryasset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we havenot entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. It isdifficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations. Foreign currency losses of $140 million, $129 million, and $105 millionwere recognized in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, as interest and other income, net in our consolidated statements of income.Interest Rate SensitivityOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.Our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. governmentsecurities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation ofcapital and supporting our liquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketablesecurities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $714 million and$794 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Any realized gains orlosses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.Equity Investment RiskOur equity investments are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our holdings. Wecontinually evaluate our equity investments in privately-held companies.Our equity investments are investments in equity securities of privately-held companies without readily determinable fair values. We elected to account formost of our equity investments using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observabletransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. We perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there aretriggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook;industry and sector performance; economic or technological environment; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. Valuations of our equityinvestments are complex due to the lack of readily available market data and observable transactions. Volatility in the global economic climate and financialmarkets, including recent and ongoing effects related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which requires significant judgments, could result in a materialimpairment charge on our equity investments. Equity investments accounted for under the equity method were immaterial as of December 31, 2021 andDecember 31, 2020. Our total equity investments had a carrying value of $6.78 billion and $6.23 billion as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020,respectively.For additional information about our equity investments, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 5 — Equity Investments, andNote 6 — Fair Value Measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and SupplementaryData" and Part II, Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies andEstimates" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.73Table of ContentsItem 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary DataMETA PLATFORMS, INC.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the relatedconsolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021,and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in allmaterial respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the threeyears in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internalcontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee ofSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 2, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statementsbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordancewith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures toassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Suchprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating theaccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believethat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required tobe communicated to the Audit & Risk Oversight Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on theconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the criticalaudit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.75Table of ContentsLoss ContingenciesDescription of the MatterAs described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is party to various legal proceedings, claims, andregulatory or government inquiries and investigations. The Company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable andthe amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that it will incur a loss insome of these cases, actions or inquiries described above. When applicable, the Company discloses an estimate of the amount ofloss or range of possible loss that may be incurred. However, for certain other matters, the Company discloses that the amount ofsuch losses or a range of possible losses cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.Auditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these loss contingencies was especially challenging due to thesignificant judgment required to evaluate management's assessments of the likelihood of a loss, and their estimate of the potentialamount or range of such losses.How We Addressed the Matterin Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the identification andevaluation of these matters, including controls relating to the Company's assessment of the likelihood that a loss will be realizedand their ability to reasonably estimate the potential range of possible losses.To test the Company's assessment of the probability of incurrence of a loss, whether the loss was reasonably estimable, and theconclusion and disclosure regarding any range of possible losses, including when the Company believes it cannot be reasonablyestimated at this time, we read the minutes or a summary of the meetings of the committees of the board of directors, read theproceedings, claims, and regulatory, or government inquiries and investigations, or summaries as we deemed appropriate,requested and received internal and external legal counsel confirmation letters, met with internal and external legal counsel todiscuss the nature of the various matters, and obtained representations from management. We also evaluated the appropriatenessof the related disclosures included in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.76Table of ContentsUncertain Tax PositionsDescription of the MatterAs discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has received certain notices from the InternalRevenue Service (IRS) related to transfer pricing agreements with the Company's foreign subsidiaries for certain periodsexamined. The IRS has stated that it will also apply its position to tax years subsequent to those examined. If the IRS prevails inits position, it could result in an additional federal tax liability, plus interest and any penalties asserted. The Company usesjudgment to (1) determine whether a tax position's technical merits are more-likely-than-not to be sustained and (2) measure theamount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition.Auditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these uncertain tax positions was especially challenging due to thesignificant judgment required to assess management's evaluation of technical merits and the measurement of the tax positionbased on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.How We Addressed the Matterin Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company'sprocess to assess the technical merits of tax positions related to these transfer pricing agreements and to measure the benefit ofthose tax positions.As part of our audit procedures over the Company's accounting for these positions, we involved our tax professionals to assistwith our assessment of the technical merits of the Company's tax positions. This included assessing the Company'scorrespondence with the relevant tax authorities, evaluating income tax opinions or other third-party advice obtained by theCompany, and requesting and receiving confirmation letters from third-party advisors. We also used our knowledge of, andexperience with, the application of international and local income tax laws by the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate theCompany's accounting for those tax positions. We analyzed the Company's assumptions and data used to determine the amountof the federal tax liability recognized and tested the mathematical accuracy of the underlying data and calculations. We alsoevaluated the appropriateness of the related disclosures included in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in relation tothese matters./s/ Ernst & Young LLPWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2007.Redwood City, CaliforniaFebruary 2, 202277Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Meta Platforms, Inc.Opinion on Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited Meta Platforms, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control –Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion,Meta Platforms, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on theCOSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balancesheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cashflows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated February 2, 2022 expressed an unqualifiedopinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internalcontrol over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to expressan opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and arerequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of theSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assuranceabout whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluatingthe design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in thecircumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financialreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLPRedwood City, CaliforniaFebruary 2, 202278Table of ContentsMETA PLATFORMS, INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(In millions, except for

INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNote 1.Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesOrganization and Description of BusinessWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004. In October 2021, we changed our corporate name from Facebook, Inc. to Meta Platforms, Inc. Our missionis to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. All of our products, including our apps, share the vision of helping to bring themetaverse to life.We report our financial results based on two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). The segment information aligns with howthe chief operating decision maker (CODM), who is our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), reviews and manages the business. We generate substantially all of ourrevenue from advertising.Basis of PresentationWe prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The consolidated financialstatements include the accounts of Meta Platforms, Inc., its subsidiaries where we have controlling financial interests, and any variable interest entities for whichwe are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.Use of EstimatesPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts inthe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets andliabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on various other assumptions thatwe believe are reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not limited to, those relatedto revenue recognition, valuation of equity investments, income taxes, loss contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill, intangible assets, andproperty and equipment, and their associated estimated useful lives, credit losses of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, credit losses of accounts receivable,fair value of financial instruments, and leases. These estimates are based on management's knowledge about current events and expectations about actions we mayundertake in the future. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.In connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, we extended the estimated average useful lives of selectedcohorts of servers and network assets from three years to four years in prior years as well as in 2021 as a result of longer refresh cycles in our data centers. Prioryear changes individually or in aggregate did not have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements. The effect of the 2021 changes was a reduction indepreciation expense of $620 million and an increase in net income of $516 million, or $0.18 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2021. The impactfrom the changes in our estimates was calculated based on the asset bases existing as of the effective dates of the changes and applying the revised estimated usefullives prospectively.Revenue RecognitionRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expectto be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.We determine revenue recognition by applying the following steps:•identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;•identification of the performance obligations in the contract;•determination of the transaction price;•allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and•recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.85Table of ContentsRevenue excludes sales and usage‑based taxes where it has been determined that we are acting as a pass‑through agent.AdvertisingAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications.Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered orthe number of actions, such as clicks, taken by our users.We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considereddelivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketercontracted for. In general, we report advertising revenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Ourcontrol is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. For revenue generated from arrangementsthat involve third-party publishers, we evaluate whether we are the principal or the agent, and for those advertising revenue arrangements where we are the agent,we recognize revenue on a net basis.We may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and certain customers may receive cash-based incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate theseamounts and reduce revenue based on the amounts expected to be provided to customers. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates ofvariable consideration.Reality Labs RevenueRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, Facebook Portal, and wearables, and related software andcontent. Revenue is recognized at the time control of the products is transferred to customers, which is generally at the time of delivery, in an amount that reflectsthe consideration RL expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products.Other RevenueOther revenue consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from various other sources.Deferred Revenue and DepositsDeferred revenue and deposits mostly consists of billings and payments we receive from marketers in advance of revenue recognition, revenue not yetrecognized for unspecified software upgrades and updates for various RL products. Deposits relate to unused balances held on behalf of our users who primarilyuse these balances to make purchases in games on our platform. Once the unused balance is utilized by a user, the majority of this amount would then be payable tothe developer and the balance would be recognized as revenue. The increase in the deferred revenue and deposits balance for the year ended December 31, 2021was driven by cash payments from customers in advance of satisfying our performance obligations in RL sales and advertising revenue, offset by revenuerecognized that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period.Our payment terms vary by the products or services offered. The term between billings and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products orservices and customer types, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.Practical Expedients and ExemptionsWe expense sales commissions when incurred if the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within marketing and sales on ourconsolidated statements of income.86Table of ContentsWe do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contractsfor which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.Cost of RevenueOur cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to theoperation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payroll andrelated expenses which include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includescosts associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processing customer transactions; RL cost ofproducts sold; and content costs.Content CostsOur content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to increase engagement on the platform. Forlicensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted and available for viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. Video content costs thatmeet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.For licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. Expensed content costs are included in cost of revenue on theconsolidated statements of income.Software Development CostsSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed or sold to external users,are expensed before the software or technology reach technological feasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.Software development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and applications used to deliver our services.These software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will becompleted and the software will be used to perform the function intended.Development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.Share-based CompensationShare-based compensation expense consists of the company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to employees are measured based on thegrant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four years. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized based on thestraight-line basis over the requisite service period. We account for forfeitures as they occur.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision forincome taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.We record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Underthis method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reportingand tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that areexpected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred incometax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment.87Table of ContentsWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider allavailable evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income andongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examinationby the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have beendeveloped based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits arebased on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although webelieve that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final taxoutcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance whenfacts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters isdifferent from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could havea material impact on our financial condition and operating results.Advertising ExpenseAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on the consolidated statements of income. We incurredadvertising expenses of $2.99 billion, $2.26 billion, and $1.57 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.Cash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted CashCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks and highly liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase.We hold investments in marketable securities, consisting of U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporatedebt securities. We classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale (AFS) investments in our current assets because they represent investments of cashavailable for current operations. Our AFS investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, included in accumulatedother comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. AFS debt securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed todetermine what amount of that difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities are recognized as a chargein interest and other income, net on our consolidated statements of income, and any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included in accumulated othercomprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. The amounts of credit losses recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were not material.There was no impairment charge for any unrealized losses in 2019. We determine realized gains or losses on sale of marketable securities on a specificidentification method and include such gains or losses in interest and other income, net on the consolidated statements of income.We also maintain a multi-currency notional cash pool for our participating entities with a third-party bank provider. Actual cash balances are not physicallyconverted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. We classify the overdraft balances within accrued expenses and other current liabilities onthe consolidated balance sheets.We classify certain restricted cash balances within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets based uponthe term of the remaining restrictions.Equity InvestmentsOur equity investments are investments in equity securities of privately-held companies without readily determinable fair values. We elected to account formost of our equity investments using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value from observabletransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer as of the respective transaction dates. The change in carrying value, if any, is recognized ininterest and other income, net on our consolidated statements of income. We periodically review our equity investments for impairment. If88Table of Contentsindicators exist and the estimated fair value of an investment is below the carrying amount, we will write down the investment to fair value.In addition, we also held equity investments accounted for under the equity method which were immaterial as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.Fair Value MeasurementsWe apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value inthe financial statements on a recurring basis. We define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in anorderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which arerequired to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurementsor assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk.Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorizationwithin the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:Level 1- Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2- Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets orliabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets orliabilities.Level 3- Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing theasset or liability.Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because their fair value is derived fromquoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs.Our equity investments accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. When indicators of impairmentexist or observable price changes of qualified transactions occur, the respective equity investment would be classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchybecause the valuation methods include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility,rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.Accounts Receivable and AllowancesAccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts. We make estimatesof expected credit and collectibility trends for the allowance for credit losses and allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of various factors,including historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of our customers, current economic conditions, reasonable andsupportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. Expected credit losses are recorded asgeneral and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the allowances for accounts receivable wereimmaterial.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment, which includes amounts recorded under finance leases, which are amortized, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter.89Table of ContentsThe estimated useful lives of property and equipment and amortization periods of finance lease right-of-use assets are described below:Property and Equipment Useful Life/ Amortization periodServers and network assetsFour yearsBuildings25 to 30 yearsEquipment and otherOne to 25 yearsFinance lease right-of-use assetsThree to 20 yearsLeasehold improvementsLesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term We evaluate at least annually the recoverability of property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that thecarrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment assets is not recoverable, andthe asset's fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. We have not recorded any material impairment charges during the yearspresented.The useful lives of our property and equipment are determined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for theremaining estimated useful lives. Our current estimate of useful lives represents the best estimate of the useful lives based on current facts and circumstances, butmay differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as changes to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, andtechnological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted forprospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life. See section "Use of Estimates" above for additional information regardingchanges in the estimated useful lives of our servers and network assets.Servers and network assets include property and equipment mostly in our data centers, which is used to support production traffic. Land and assets heldwithin construction in progress are not depreciated. Construction in progress is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have notyet been placed in service for their intended use.The cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciationare removed from their respective accounts, and any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in income from operations.Lease ObligationsWe have operating leases comprised of certain offices, data centers, land, colocations, network infrastructure, and other equipment. We also have financeleases for certain network infrastructure. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Most of our leases contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components include fixed payments for maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-lease componentsand account for them as a single lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent rent escalations, common area maintenance,insurance, real estate taxes, or other costs. Such variable lease costs are expensed as incurred on the consolidated statements of income. For certain colocation andequipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities.For leases with a lease term greater than 12 months, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at thecommencement date based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease payments and includes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time ofcommencement.Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. When determining theprobability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based, asset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors.90Table of ContentsAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement datein determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit ratingwould be in a similar economic environment.Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on ourconsolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on ourconsolidated balance sheets.Operating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorterof the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms.Loss ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business.Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with variouslegal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Therequirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and anyfailure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, weevaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amountcan be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, wedisclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters andrelated reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of ourdefenses and the impact of negotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment isrequired to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted andunasserted matters. Certain factors, in particular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on updatedinformation available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be the result of new laws and preliminary interpretationsregarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it difficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted against us.In addition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, are subject to review byother regulatory bodies before decisions can be finalized, which can lead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result of these and other factors,we reasonably expect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be revised in future quarters.Business CombinationsWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on theirestimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill toreporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects theamortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, includinggoodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assetsacquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments arerecorded to earnings. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from business combinations and are expensed as incurred.Goodwill and Intangibles AssetsWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from business combinations. We evaluate our reporting units annually, as well aswhen changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill istested for impairment at the reporting unit level91Table of Contentsannually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Wehave two reporting units subject to goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31, 2021, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.We evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amountof such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation of these intangible assets are performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largelyindependent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the futureundiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of finite-livedintangible assets is not recoverable, and the assets fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. We have not recorded anymaterial impairment charges during the years presented.Our finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are notamortized. If an indefinite-lived intangible asset is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life, the asset will be tested for impairment and accounted for asa finite-lived intangible asset prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of finite-livedintangible assets. If we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance is amortized over the revised estimated usefullife.Foreign CurrencyGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S.dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Translation gains and losses arerecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2021, we had a cumulative translationloss, net of tax of $677 million and as of December 31, 2020, we had a cumulative translation gain, net of tax of $439 million.Foreign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary involved arerecorded within interest and other income, net on our consolidated statements of income. Net losses resulting from foreign currency transactions were$140 million, $129 million, and $105 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.Credit Risk and ConcentrationOur financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketablesecurities, and accounts receivable. The majority of cash equivalents consists of money market funds, that primarily invest in U.S. government and agencysecurities. Marketable securities consist of investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debtsecurities. Our investment portfolio in corporate debt securities is highly liquid and diversified among individual issuers. The amount of credit losses recorded forthe year ended December 31, 2021 was not material.Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different industries and countries. We generated41%, 42%, and 43% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, from marketers and developers based in the UnitedStates, with the majority of revenue outside of the United States coming from customers located in western Europe, China, Canada, Australia, Brazil, and Thailand.We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. We maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses, andbad debt expense on these losses was not material during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019. In the event that accounts receivable collection cyclesdeteriorate, our operating results and financial position could be adversely affected.No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.92Table of ContentsRecently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsOn January 1, 2021, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-01, Investments—Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments—EquityMethod and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) (ASU 2020-01), which clarifies the interaction of the accounting for equitysecurities under Topic 321, the accounting for equity method investments in Topic 323, and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options inTopic 815. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.On October 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (ASU 2020-06), whichsimplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models available for convertible debt instruments. This guidance alsoeliminates the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments and requires the use of the if-converted method. The newstandard was effective for us beginning January 1, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on ourconsolidated financial statements.On October 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU No. 2021-05, Leases (Topic 842): Lessors – Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments (ASU 2016-02),which requires a lessor to classify a lease with variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate as an operating lease if specified criteria are met. Thenew standard was effective for us beginning January 1, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact onour consolidated financial statements.Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities fromContracts with Customers (ASU 2021-08), which clarifies that an acquirer of a business should recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in abusiness combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Thisguidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2023 on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of thenew guidance on our consolidated financial statements.In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosure by Business Entities about Government Assistance(ASU 2021-10), which improves the transparency of government assistance received by most business entities by requiring the disclosure of: (1) the types ofgovernment assistance received; (2) the accounting for such assistance; and (3) the effect of the assistance on a business entity's financial statements. This guidancewill be effective for us in the year ended December 31, 2022, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on ourconsolidated financial statements.Note 2.RevenueRevenue disaggregated by revenue source and by segment consists of the following (in millions). For comparative purposes, amounts in prior periods havebeen recast:Year Ended December 31, 202120202019Advertising$114,934 $84,169 $69,655 Other revenue721 657 541 Family of Apps$115,655 $84,826 $70,196 Reality Labs2,274 1,139 501 Total revenue$117,929 $85,965 $70,697 93Table of ContentsRevenue disaggregated by geography, based on the addresses of our customers, consists of the following (in millions): Year Ended December 31,  202120202019United States and Canada$51,541 $38,433 $32,206 Europe29,057 20,349 16,826 Asia-Pacific26,739 19,848 15,406 Rest of World10,592 7,335 6,259 Total revenue$117,929 $85,965 $70,697 _________________________(1)United States revenue was $48.38 billion, $36.25 billion, and $30.23 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.(2)Europe includes Russia and Turkey, and Rest of World includes Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East.Our total deferred revenue was $596 million and $371 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we expect$517 million of our deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year.Note 3.Earnings per ShareWe compute earnings per share (EPS) of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method. As the liquidation and dividend rights for bothClass A and Class B common stock are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis to the weighted-average number of commonshares outstanding for the period. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B commonstock outstanding.For the calculation of diluted EPS, net income for basic EPS is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including awards under our equity compensationplans.In addition, the computation of the diluted EPS of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of our Class B common stock to Class A common stock,while the diluted EPS of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares to Class A common stock. Diluted EPS is computed by dividingthe resulting net income by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding.RSUs with anti-dilutive effect were excluded from the EPS calculation and they were not material for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.Basic and diluted EPS are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights.(1)(2)(2)94Table of ContentsThe numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for our common stock are calculated as follows (in millions, except per shareamounts): Year Ended December 31, 202120202019 Class AClass BClass AClass BClass AClassB Basic EPS:      Numerator      Net income$33,328 $6,042 $24,607 $4,539 $15,569 $2,916 Denominator      Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share2,383 432 2,407 444 2,404 450 Basic EPS$13.99 $13.99 $10.22 $10.22 $6.48 $6.48 Diluted EPS:    Numerator      Net income$33,328 $6,042 $24,607 $4,539 $15,569 $2,916 Reallocation of net income as a result of conversion of Class B to Class Acommon stock6,042 — 4,539 — 2,916 — Reallocation of net income to Class B common stock— (93)— (58)— (18)Net income for diluted EPS$39,370 $5,949 $29,146 $4,481 $18,485 $2,898 Denominator      Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share2,383 432 2,407 444 2,404 450 Conversion of Class B to Class A common stock432 — 444 — 450 — Weighted-average effect of dilutive RSUs44 — 37 — 22 1 Shares used in computation of diluted earnings per share2,859 432 2,888 444 2,876 451 Diluted EPS$13.77 $13.77 $10.09 $10.09 $6.43 $6.43 95Table of ContentsNote 4.Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesThe following table sets forth the cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities (in millions):December 31,20212020Cash and cash equivalents:Cash$7,308 $6,488 Money market funds8,850 9,755 U.S. government securities25 1,016 U.S. government agency securities108 — Certificates of deposit and time deposits250 305 Corporate debt securities60 12 Total cash and cash equivalents16,601 17,576 Marketable securities:U.S. government securities10,901 20,921 U.S. government agency securities5,927 11,698 Corporate debt securities14,569 11,759 Total marketable securities31,397 44,378 Total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities$47,998 $61,954 The gross unrealized gains on our marketable securities were not material and $641 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Commitments and ContingenciesGuaranteeIn 2018, we established a multi-currency notional cash pool for certain of our entities with a third-party bank provider. Actual cash balances are notphysically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. As part of the notional cash pool agreement, the bank extends overdraft credit toour participating entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of each day is at least zero. In theunlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool, any overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Meta Platforms, Inc.Other Contractual CommitmentsWe have $23.08 billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2021, which are primarily related to our investments in servers,network infrastructure, and Reality Labs. These commitments are primarily due within five years.(1)101Table of ContentsLegal and Related MattersBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhereagainst us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection withour platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms andpolicies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the UnitedStates against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for thesecond quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for theNorthern District of California with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25, 2019, thedistrict court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to amend. On November 15, 2019, a second amendedcomplaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. On August 7, 2020, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the second amendedcomplaint, with leave to amend. On October 16, 2020, a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. On December 20,2021, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint, with prejudice. On January 17, 2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal ofthe order dismissing their case. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer,became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and otherjurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, oursettlement with the FTC required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion which was paid in April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified consent order. The stateattorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing. On July 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative action was filed inDelaware Chancery Court against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform anduser data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a related DelawareChancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with ourhistorical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholderderivative action. We believe the lawsuits described above are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.We also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulatorsregarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. The GDPR is still a relatively new law and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject toreview by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of suchinvestigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject tosignificant uncertainty. Although we are vigorously defending our regulatory compliance, we have accrued significant amounts for loss contingencies related tothese inquiries and investigations in Europe, and we believe there is a reasonable possibility that additional accruals for losses related to these matters could bematerial in the aggregate.We are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices. For example, beginning inSeptember 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal companydocuments concerning, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as misinformation and otherundesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. Beginning on October 27, 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed in federal court in the UnitedStates against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the same matters. We believe these lawsuits arewithout merit, and we are vigorously defending them.In addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory agencies, including in particular in Brazil,Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including ourobligation to disclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and penalties against us.We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such finesand penalties.102Table of ContentsWith respect to the cases, actions, and inquiries described above, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when webelieve a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some ofthese matters. With respect to the matters described above that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible loss, such losses or range ofpossible losses either cannot be estimated or are not individually material, but we believe there is a reasonable possibility that they may be material in theaggregate.We are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary courseof business. For example, we are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competition authorities in theUnited States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of socialnetworking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we wereinformed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint against us in the U.S. DistrictCourt for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the FederalTrade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions onaccess to our platform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice andstate attorneys general. On December 9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia filed a complaint against usin the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, includingby acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The complaint also alleged that we violatedSection 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The complaints of the FTC and attorneys general both sought a permanent injunction againstour company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28,2021, the court granted our motions to dismiss the complaints filed by the FTC and attorneys general, dismissing the FTC's complaint with leave to amend anddismissing the attorneys general's case without prejudice. On July 28, 2021, the attorneys general filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case. OnAugust 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, thecourt denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint. Multiple putative class actions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the UnitedStates against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and other alleged anticompetitive conduct,and seeking damages and unspecified injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users were consolidated in the U.S. DistrictCourt for the Northern District of California. On January 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions.We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world. The requirements for complying with theseobligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligationscould eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these other legal proceedings, claims, regulatory, tax, or government inquiries andinvestigations, and other matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a lossis probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these othermatters. We believe that the amount of losses or any estimable range of possible losses with respect to these other matters will not, either individually or in theaggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.The ultimate outcome of the legal and related matters described in this section, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, orprobable, or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved againstus for amounts in excess of management's estimates of loss, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in whichany such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.For information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 14 — Income Taxes.103Table of ContentsIndemnificationsIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certainmatters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual propertyinfringement or other claims made by third parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of theclaim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain employees, and our certificate of incorporation andbylaws contain similar indemnification obligations.It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnificationclaims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had amaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, as of December 31, 2021, there was not a reasonable possibility we had incurred amaterial loss with respect to indemnification of such parties. We have not recorded any liability for costs related to indemnification through December 31, 2021.Note 12. Stockholders' EquityCommon StockOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2021, we are authorizedto issue 5,000 million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141 million shares of Class B common stock, each with a par value of $0.000006 per share. Holdersof our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as and if, declared by our board of directors, subject to the rights of theholders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. As of December 31, 2021, we have not declared any dividends. The holder of eachshare of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote, while the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes. Shares of our Class Bcommon stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stockupon transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are referred to as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unlessotherwise noted.As of December 31, 2021, there were 2,328 million shares of Class A common stock and 413 million shares of Class B common stock issued andoutstanding.Share Repurchase ProgramOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have anexpiration date. As of December 31, 2020, $8.60 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases under this program. In January 2021 and October 2021,additional $25.0 billion and $50.0 billion of repurchases were authorized under this program, respectively. In 2021, we repurchased and subsequently retired136 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $44.81 billion. As of December 31, 2021, $38.79 billion remained available andauthorized for repurchases.The timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business andmarket conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be repurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions,including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.Share-based Compensation PlansSince 2020, we have maintained one active share-based employee compensation plan, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, which was amended in each of June2016, February 2018 (Amended 2012 Plan). Our Amended 2012 Plan provides for the issuance of incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted stockawards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance shares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors, and consultants. Shares that are withheld inconnection with the net settlement of RSUs or forfeited under our stock plan are added to the reserves of the Amended 2012 Plan.104Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2021, there were 116 million shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under our Amended 2012 Plan. Pursuantto the automatic increase provision under our Amended 2012 Plan, the number of shares reserved for issuance increases automatically on January 1 of each of thecalendar years during the term of the Amended 2012 Plan, which will continue through April 2026 , by a number of shares of Class A common stock equal to thelesser of (i) 2.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock as of the immediately preceding December 31st or (ii) a number of sharesdetermined by our board of directors. Pursuant to this automatic increase provision, our board of directors approved an increase of 20 million shares of Class Acommon stock reserved for issuance effective January 1, 2022.The following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2021:Number of SharesWeighted-AverageGrant Date Fair ValuePer Share(in thousands)Unvested at December 31, 202096,733 $181.88 Granted59,127 $305.40 Vested(44,574)$198.95 Forfeited(12,438)$211.58 Unvested at December 31, 202198,848 $244.32 The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $188.73 and $173.66, respectively. Thefair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $14.42 billion, $9.38 billion, and$6.01 billion, respectively.

We have federal tax credit carryforwards of $527 million, which will begin to expire in 2029, if not utilized, and statetax credit carryforwards of $3.18 billion, most of which do not expire.Utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitationsprovided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such annual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax creditcarryforwards before their utilization. The events that may cause ownership changes include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock ownership change of greaterthan 50% over a three‑year period.The following table reflects changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions): Year Ended December 31,  202120202019Gross unrecognized tax benefits ‑ beginning of period$8,692 $7,863 $4,678 Increases related to prior year tax positions328 356 2,309 Decreases related to prior year tax positions(86)(253)(525)Increases related to current year tax positions963 1,045 1,402 Decreases related to settlements of prior year tax positions(90)(319)(1)Gross unrecognized tax benefits ‑ end of period$9,807 $8,692 $7,863 These unrecognized tax benefits were primarily accrued for the uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includelicensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions, as well as for107Table of Contentsthe uncertainties with our research tax credits. During all years presented, we recognized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within theprovision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of income. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were$960 million and $774 million, respectively.If the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits of $9.81 billion as of December 31, 2021 were realized in a future period, this would result in a tax benefitof $5.70 billion within our provision of income taxes at such time.We are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject topotential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2014 through 2019 tax yearsand by the Irish tax authorities for our 2016 through 2018 tax years. Our 2020 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination by the IRS. Our 2019 andsubsequent tax years remain open to examination in Ireland.In July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction withthe examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequentto 2010 and has done so in years covered by the second Notice described below. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the TaxCourt challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS's amendment to answer was filed stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higherthan the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first session of the trial was completed in March 2020 and a second session commenced in October 2021. Based onthe information provided, we believe that, if the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregateamount of up to approximately $9.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted.In March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The IRS applied itsposition from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certaintax credits that we claimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up toapproximately $680 million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with thepositions of the IRS in the second Notice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.We have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740), that is lower thanthe potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in the two Notices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails inits positions related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax that weowe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As of December 31, 2021, we have not resolvedthese matters and proceedings continue in the Tax Court.We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax itemsthat may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonablypossible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining that are subjectto examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If the taxing authorities prevailin the assessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results ofoperations, and cash flows.Note 15. Segment and Geographical InformationBeginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, we report our financial results based on two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL).FoA includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other services. RL includes augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware, software,and content. As of December 31, 2021, our operating segments are the same as our reportable segments.The CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about the operatingsegment's revenue and income (loss) from operations. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset or liability information.108Table of ContentsRevenue and costs and expenses are generally directly attributed to our segments. These costs and expenses include certain product development relatedoperating expenses, costs associated with the partnership arrangements, consumer hardware product costs, content costs, and legal-related costs. Indirect costs areallocated to segments based on a reasonable allocation methodology, when such costs are significant to the performance measures of the operating segments.Indirect cost of revenue is allocated to our segments based on usage, such as costs related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure. Indirectoperating expenses, such as facilities, information technology, certain shared research and development activities, recruiting, and physical security expenses, aremostly allocated based on headcount.The following table sets forth our segment information of revenue and income (loss) from operations (in millions).

Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31, 2021,our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we arerequired to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified inthe rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, includingour CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under theExchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in InternalControl—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the assessment,management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021 to provide reasonable assurance regarding thereliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our independent registered public accounting firm,Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Reporton Form 10-K.Changes in Internal ControlThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of theExchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2021 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial ReportingIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controlsand procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, thedesign of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and thatmanagement is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.Item 9B.Other InformationNone.Item 9C.
