Our ads enable marketers to reach people based on a varietyof factors including age, gender, location, interests, and behaviors. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook, Instagram,Messenger, and third-party applications and websites.CompetitionOur business is characterized by innovation, rapid change, and disruptive technologies. We compete with companies providing connection andcommunication products and services to users online, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools andsystems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to,companies that facilitate the ability of users to share, communicate, and discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing orprospective audiences, including, for example, Google, Apple, YouTube, Tencent, Snap, Twitter, ByteDance, Microsoft, and Amazon. We compete to attract,engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retaindevelopers to build compelling mobile and web applications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumerhardware and virtual reality products and services. As we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce newproducts and services, we may become subject to additional competition.7Table of ContentsTechnologyOur product development philosophy is centered on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are social by design, which means thatour products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the core of the product experience. As our user base grows, as engagement with productslike video and VR increases, and as we deepen our investment in new technologies like artificial intelligence, our computing needs continue to expand. We makesignificant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones, as well as for our marketers and developers. Weare also investing in protecting the security, privacy, and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen our systems againstabuse.Sales and OperationsThe majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We also have a global sales force that isfocused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to them throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-making toreal-time optimizations to post-campaign analytics. We work directly with these advertisers, as well as through advertising agencies and resellers. We operate inmore than 80 cities around the globe, the majority of which have a sales presence. We also invest in and rely on self-service tools to provide direct customersupport to our users and partners.MarketingHistorically, our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with them, supported by internal efforts tostimulate awareness and interest. In addition, we have invested and will continue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help buildcommunity around the world.Intellectual PropertyTo establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, including know-how, licenseagreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and othercontractual rights. In addition, to further protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from third parties. Wedo not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the duration ofour patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products.Government RegulationWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, many of which are stillevolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations involve matters including privacy,data use, data protection and personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, dataretention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, artificial intelligence, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protectionof minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, anti-corruptionand political law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regardingprivacy and protection of people's data. Foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations orbe more restrictive than those in the United States.These U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities,are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are oftenuncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country andinconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our usersor obtain consent to various practices, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products, could adversely affect our financial results. In theUnited States, there have been, and continue to be, various efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230of the Communications Decency Act, and any such changes may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations,which could adversely affect our business and financial results.8Table of ContentsWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receivecertain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products andservices. If we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among ourproducts and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which couldadversely affect our financial results. For example, the Privacy Shield, a transfer framework we relied upon for data transferred from the European Union to theUnited States, was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Facebook relies totransfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. In August 2020, we received apreliminary draft decision from the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) that preliminarily concluded that Facebook Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect ofEuropean user data does not achieve compliance with the GDPR and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the European Union to the UnitedStates should therefore be suspended. Facebook Ireland challenged procedural aspects of this IDPC inquiry in a judicial review commenced in the Irish High Courtin September 2020. While we also rely upon alternative legal bases for data transfers, if a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we areunable to continue to rely on SCCs or validly rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from Europe to the United States, we may be unable to operatematerial portions of our business in Europe as a result of the CJEU's invalidation of the Privacy Shield and any final decision of IDPC, which would materially andadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR) took effect in May 2018 and applies to all of our products and services used by people in Europe. The GDPR includes operational requirements forcompanies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are different from those previously in place in the European Union, andincludes significant penalties for non-compliance. The Brazilian General Data Protection Law recently took effect and imposes data privacy-related requirementssimilar to GDPR on products and services offered to users in Brazil. The California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect in January 2020, also establishescertain transparency rules and creates new data privacy rights for users. In addition, effective December 2020, the European Union's ePrivacy Directive includesadditional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or businesspractices as a result of these developments may adversely affect our advertising business. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the EuropeanUnion, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting ourbusiness, such as liability for copyright infringement. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protectionrequirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.We are, and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits by governmentauthorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumerprotection, and competition, as we continue to grow and expand our operations. We are also currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders orconsent decrees, including the modified consent order we entered into with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which took effect in April 2020 and, amongother matters, requires us to implement a comprehensive expansion of our privacy program. Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by,government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (includingsubstantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, result in negative publicityand reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies thatadversely affect our business.For additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Human CapitalAt Facebook, we design products to bring the world closer together, one connection at a time. As a company, we believe that people are at the heart of everyconnection we build. We are proud of our unique company culture where ideas, innovation, and impact win, and we work hard to build strong teams acrossengineering, product design, marketing, and other areas to further our mission.9Table of ContentsWe had a global workforce of 58,604 employees as of December 31, 2020, which represents a 30% year-over-year increase in employee headcount. Weexpect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future, particularly as we continue to focus on recruiting employees in technical functions. In addition, weplan to continue to hire a number of employees and contractors to continue to bolster various privacy, safety, security, and content review initiatives as well asother functions to support our expected growth.Our headquarters are located in Menlo Park, California and we have offices in more than 80 cities around the globe. The vast majority of our personnel arecurrently working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in the long term, we expect some personnel to transition to working remotely on a regularbasis.Diversity and InclusionDiversity and inclusion are core to our work at Facebook. We seek to build a diverse and inclusive workplace where we can leverage our collectivecognitive diversity to build the best products and make the best decisions for the global community we serve. While we have made progress, we still have morework to do.We publish our global gender diversity and U.S. ethnic diversity workforce data annually. In 2020, we announced that as of June 30, 2020, our globalemployee base was comprised of 37% females and 63% males, and our U.S. employee base was comprised of the following ethnicities: 44.4% Asian, 41% White,6.3% Hispanic, 4% two or more ethnicities, 3.9% Black, and 0.4% additional groups (including American Indian or Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian or OtherPacific Islander). We also announced our goals to have 50% of our workforce made up of underrepresented populations by 2024, and to increase the representationof people of color in leadership positions in the United States, including Black leadership, by 30% from 2020 to 2025. We will also continue our ongoing efforts toincrease the representation of women in leadership.We work to support our goals of diversifying our workforce through recruiting, retention, people development, and inclusion. We employ our DiverseSlate Approach in our global recruitment efforts, which ensures that teams and hiring managers have the opportunity to consider qualified people fromunderrepresented groups for open roles. We have seen steady increases in hiring rates of people from underrepresented groups since we started testing thisapproach in 2015. We also continue to provide diversity and inclusion training for our recruiting team and develop inclusive internship programs. FacebookUniversity, our training program for college freshmen and sophomores with an interest in Computer Science, also utilizes a proactive and inclusive approach topromote participation by people from underrepresented groups. To help build community among our people and support their professional development, we investin our internal Facebook Resource Groups and our annual Community events such as Women's Community Summit, Black Community Summit, Latin CommunitySummit, and Pride Community Summit. We also offer Managing Unconscious Bias, Managing Inclusion, and Be the Ally trainings to promote an inclusiveworkplace by helping people understand the issues that affect underrepresented communities and how to reduce the effects of bias in the workplace.Compensation and BenefitsWe offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people, and we help care for our people so they can focus on our mission. Our employees'total compensation package includes market-competitive salary, bonuses or sales commissions, and equity. We generally offer full-time employees equity at thetime of hire and through annual equity grants because we want them to be owners of the company and committed to our long-term success. We have conducted payequity analyses for many years, and continue to be committed to pay equity. In 2020, we announced that our analyses indicate that we continue to have pay equityacross gender globally and race in the United States for people in similar jobs, accounting for factors such as location, role, and level.Through Life@ Facebook, our holistic approach to benefits, we provide our employees and their loved ones resources to help them thrive. We offer a widerange of benefits across areas such as health, family, finance, community, and time away, including healthcare and wellness benefits, adoption and surrogacyassistance, family care resources, a 401(k) plan, access to tax and legal services, Facebook Resource Groups to build community at Facebook, family leave, andpaid time off.10Table of ContentsCorporate InformationWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004.

These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to, risksrelated to:Risks Related to Our Product Offerings•our ability to add and retain users and maintain levels of user engagement with our products;•the loss of, or reduction in spending by, our marketers;•reduced availability of data signals used by our ad targeting and measurement tools;•ineffective operation with mobile operating systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners;•failure of our new products, or changes to our existing products, to attract or retain users or generate revenue;Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results•the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on our advertising business;•our ability to compete effectively;•unfavorable media coverage and other risks affecting our ability to maintain and enhance our brands;•volatile or slower user and revenue growth rates in the future;•acquisitions and our ability to successfully integrate our acquisitions;•our ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure, and risks associated with disruptions in our service;•operating our business in multiple countries around the world;•litigation, including class action lawsuits;Risks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement•government restrictions on access to Facebook or our other products, or other actions that impair our ability to sell advertising, in their countries;•complex and evolving U.S. and foreign privacy, data use and data protection, content, competition, consumer protection, and other laws and regulations;12Table of Contents•the impact of government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, including litigation and investigations by privacy and competitionauthorities;•our ability to comply with regulatory and legislative privacy requirements, including our consent order with the Federal Trade Commission;Risks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property•the occurrence of security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, and other cyber incidents or undesirable activity on ourplatform;•our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights; andRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock•limitations on the ability of holders of our Class A Common Stock to influence corporate matters due to the dual class structure of our common stock andthe control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock by our founder, Chairman, and CEO.Risks Related to Our Product OfferingsIf we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products, our revenue, financial results, andbusiness may be significantly harmed.The size of our user base and our users' level of engagement are critical to our success. Our financial performance has been and will continue to besignificantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and engaging active users of our products, particularly for Facebook and Instagram. We anticipate thatour active user growth rate will generally decline over time as the size of our active user base increases, and we expect that the size of our active user base willfluctuate or decline in one or more markets from time to time, particularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates. For example, beginning inthe first quarter of 2020, we experienced significant increases in the size and engagement of our active user base across a number of regions as a result of theCOVID-19 pandemic. More recently, we have seen user growth and engagement returning to pre-pandemic trends, and in each of the third and fourth quarters of2020, we experienced slight declines on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the number of daily active users on Facebook in the United States & Canada region. We areunable to predict the impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty, and we expect these trends to continue to be subject to volatility.If people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase thefrequency and duration of their engagement. A number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user basesor levels of engagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base orengagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user engagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as we introduce new anddifferent products and services. Any number of factors can negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement, including if:•users increasingly engage with other competitive products or services;•we fail to introduce new features, products, or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products or services, or make changes toexisting products and services, that are not favorably received;•users feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the frequency, prominence, format, size, and qualityof ads that we display;•users have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of actions by us or third parties that werely on to distribute our products and deliver our services;•user behavior on any of our products changes, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared on our products and services;13Table of Contents•we are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a variety of mobile operating systems andnetworks, and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;•there are decreases in user sentiment due to questions about the quality or usefulness of our products or our user data practices, concerns about thenature of content made available on our products, or concerns related to privacy, safety, security, well-being, or other factors;•we are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is appropriate, interesting, useful, and relevant tothem;•we are unable to obtain or attract engaging third-party content;•we are unable to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook and ourother products;•users adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services, or may not be featured or otherwiseavailable;•there are changes mandated by legislation, government and regulatory authorities, or litigation that adversely affect our products or users;•we are unable to operate material portions of our business in Europe, or are otherwise limited in such operations, as a result of European regulators,courts, or legislative bodies determining that our reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer userdata from the European Union to the United States is invalid;•there is decreased engagement with our products, or failure to accept our terms of service, as part of privacy-focused changes that we haveimplemented or may implement in the future, whether voluntarily, in connection with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EuropeanUnion's ePrivacy Directive, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), or other laws, regulations, or regulatory actions, or otherwise;•technical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience, such assecurity breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or similar content;•we adopt terms, policies, or procedures related to areas such as sharing, content, user data, or advertising, or take actions to enforce our policies, thatare perceived negatively by our users or the general public, including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent OversightBoard regarding content on our platform;•we elect to focus our product decisions on longer-term initiatives that do not prioritize near-term user growth and engagement;•we make changes in how we promote different products and services across our family of products;•initiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement are unsuccessful or discontinued, whether as a result of actions by us, third parties, orotherwise;•third-party initiatives that may enable greater use of our products, including low-cost or discounted data plans, are discontinued;•there is decreased engagement with our products as a result of taxes imposed on the use of social media or other mobile applications in certaincountries, internet shutdowns, or other actions by governments that affect the accessibility of our products in their countries;•we fail to provide adequate customer service to users, marketers, developers, or other partners;14Table of Contents•we, developers whose products are integrated with our products, or other partners and companies in our industry are the subject of adverse mediareports or other negative publicity, including as a result of our or their user data practices; or•our current or future products, such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable developers to build, grow, andmonetize mobile and web applications, reduce user activity on our products by making it easier for our users to interact and share on third-partymobile and web applications.From time to time, certain of these factors have negatively affected user retention, growth, and engagement to varying degrees. If we are unable to maintainor increase our user base and user engagement, particularly for our significant revenue-generating products like Facebook and Instagram, our revenue and financialresults may be adversely affected. Any significant decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products less attractive to users, marketers,and developers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our revenue, business, financial condition, and results of operations. If our active usergrowth rate continues to slow, we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order todrive revenue growth.We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The loss of marketers, or reduction in spending by marketers, could seriously harm ourbusiness.Substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on Facebook and Instagram. As is common in the industry, ourmarketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budgetwith us. Marketers will not continue to do business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not deliver ads in an effectivemanner, or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives. We have implemented,and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extentadversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. If we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment, thepricing of our ads may not increase, or may decline, in which case our revenue and financial results may be harmed.Our advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:•decreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products;•our inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products;•product changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or relative prominence of ads displayedon our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our products;•our inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both;•our inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users;•changes to third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising, including changes by mobileoperating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;•adverse government actions or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments relating to advertising, including developments that may impactour ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising;•user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize, including as a result of increasedusage of the Stories format or our messaging products;•reductions of advertising by marketers due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that protect the security and integrity of ourplatform;15Table of Contents•the availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of ourads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;•loss of advertising market share to our competitors, including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if competitors offer lower priced, moreintegrated, or otherwise more effective products;•limitations on our ability to operate material portions of our business in Europe as a result of European regulators, courts, or legislative bodiesdetermining that our reliance on SCCs or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States is invalid;•changes in our marketing and sales or other operations that we are required to or elect to make as a result of risks related to complying with foreignlaws or regulatory requirements or other government actions;•decisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of adverse media reports or other negative publicity involving us, our user data practices,our advertising metrics or tools, content on our products, our efforts to implement or enforce policies relating to content on our products (including asa result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board), developers with mobile and web applications that are integratedwith our products, or other companies in our industry;•reductions of advertising by marketers due to objectionable content made available on our products by third parties, questions about our user datapractices, concerns about brand safety or potential legal liability, or uncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance obligations (for example, anumber of marketers announced that they paused advertising with us in July 2020 due to concerns about content on our products);•the effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users opt out of the use of data for ads, including as a result of product changes and controlsthat we have implemented or may implement in the future in connection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, California Consumer Privacy Act(CCPA), other laws, regulations, or regulatory actions, or otherwise, that impact our ability to use data for advertising purposes;•the degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they engage with our ads;•changes in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced;•the success of technologies designed to block the display of ads or ad measurement tools;•changes in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base; and•the impact of macroeconomic conditions, whether in the advertising industry in general, or among specific types of marketers or within particulargeographies.From time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees. The occurrence of any of these or otherfactors in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our ads, which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads, or cause marketers to stop advertisingwith us altogether, either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results. For example, macroeconomic conditions have affected, and may inthe future affect, marketers' ability or willingness to spend with us, as we have seen with the regional and worldwide economic disruption related to the COVID-19pandemic and associated declines in advertising activity on our products. The effects of the pandemic previously resulted in reduced demand for our ads, a relateddecline in pricing of our ads, and additional demands on our technical infrastructure as a result of increased usage of our services, and any similar occurrences inthe future may impair our ability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users and adversely affect our revenue and financial results.16Table of ContentsOur advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we donot control, and changes to the regulatory environment, third-party mobile operating systems and browsers, and our own products have impacted, and weexpect will continue to impact, the availability of such signals, which will adversely affect our advertising revenue.We rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users. Ouradvertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate these signals, and any changes in our ability to use such signals willadversely affect our business. For example, legislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, and CCPA, have impacted, and weexpect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In particular, we have seen an increasing number of users opt out of certain typesof ad targeting in Europe following adoption of the GDPR, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in Californiafollowing adoption of the CCPA. Regulatory guidance or decisions or new legislation may require us to make additional changes to our products in the future thatfurther reduce our ability to use these signals. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced productchanges as well as future plans to limit the ability of application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in June2020, Apple announced that it plans to make certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with the release of its iOS 14 operating system thatwill reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which we expect will in turn reduce the budgets marketers are willing tocommit to us and other advertising platforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give users the ability tolimit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services, including our Off-Facebook Activity tool and our worldwideoffering of certain product changes we implemented in connection with the GDPR. These developments have limited our ability to target and measure theeffectiveness of ads on our platform, and negatively impacted our advertising revenue, and if we are unable to mitigate these developments as they take furthereffect in the future, our targeting and measurement capabilities will be materially and adversely affected, which would in turn significantly impact our futureadvertising revenue growth.Our user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies,products, and standards that we do not control.The substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue tofeature Facebook or our other products, or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products. We are dependent on theinteroperability of Facebook and our other products with popular mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control,such as the Android and iOS operating systems and mobile browsers. Any changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or changes in our relationships withmobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or mobile carriers, or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our products'functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products, give preferential treatment to competitive products, limit our ability to deliver,target, or measure the effectiveness of ads, or charge fees related to the distribution of our products or our delivery of ads could adversely affect the usage ofFacebook or our other products and monetization on mobile devices. For example, Apple previously released an update to its Safari browser that limits the use ofthird-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to our users and impacts monetization, and more recently announced changes toiOS 14 that will limit our ability to target and measure ads effectively. We expect that any similar changes to its, Google's, or other browser or mobile platformswill further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads and impact monetization. Additionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile products,it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies, products, systems, networks, and standards that we do not control, and that we havegood relationships with handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, and browser developers. We may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships withkey participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. Inthe event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use Facebook or our other products on their mobile devices, or if our users choose not to access or useFacebook or our other products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to Facebook or our other products, our user growth and userengagement could be harmed. From time to time, we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based onwhat we believe to be in our long-term best interests. Such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operatingsystems, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, browser developers, other business partners, or advertisers, and there is no assurance that these actions will resultin the anticipated long-term benefits. In the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate, ouruser growth, engagement, and monetization could be adversely affected17Table of Contentsand our business could be harmed. We have in the past experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, andstandards that we do not control, and any such occurrences in the future may negatively impact our user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices,which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.Our new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits.Our ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existingproducts and to create successful new products, both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties. We may introduce significant changesto our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development oroperating experience. For example, we do not have significant experience with consumer hardware products or virtual or augmented reality technology, which mayadversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and technologies. We continue to incur substantial costs, and we may not besuccessful in generating profits, in connection with these efforts. In addition, the introduction of new products, or changes to existing products, may result in newor enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, or other complications that could adversely affect our business and financial results. We have alsoinvested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in growing our WhatsApp and Messenger products to support increasing usage of such products.We have historically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion, and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits frommessaging over the long term. In addition, we are moving forward with plans to implement end-to-end encryption across our messaging services, as well asfacilitate cross-app communication between these platforms, which plans have drawn governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions. If our new orenhanced products fail to engage users, marketers, or developers, or if our business plans are unsuccessful, we may fail to attract or retain users or to generatesufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business may be adversely affected.We make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.We frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent withour mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, we have implemented,and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extentadversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, our Off-Facebook Activity tool enables users to place limits on ourstorage and use of information about their interactions with advertisers' apps and websites, which reduces our ability to deliver the most relevant and effective adsto our users. Similarly, from time to time we update our News Feed ranking algorithm to optimize the user experience, and these changes have had, and may in thefuture have, the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with Facebook, which could adversely affect our financial results. From timeto time, we may also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads in order to improve ad quality and overall user experience. In addition, we havemade, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, anddevelopers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on Facebook or our other products. We also may introduce new features or other changes toexisting products, or introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means ofmonetization. For example, we previously introduced the Stories format, which we do not currently monetize at the same rate as News Feed. In addition, as wefocus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time these efforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagementwith one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly. These decisionsmay adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to expand our base of users, marketers, and developers may be impaired, and our businessand financial results may be harmed.We believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands iscritical to expanding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands willdepend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully. We may introducenew18Table of Contentsproducts or terms of service or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developers or advertisersmay affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party mobile and web applications integrated with our products or interacting withparties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding userprivacy, data use, encryption, content, advertising, competition, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connection with elections or the COVID‑19pandemic, which has in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our reputation and brands. For example, in March 2018, we announceddevelopments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies. We also may fail torespond expeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of objectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers or developers, or tootherwise address user concerns, which has occurred in the past and which could erode confidence in our brands. Our brands may also be negatively affected bythe actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users, by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of ourproducts or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading (or intended to manipulate opinions), by perceived or actual efforts bygovernments to obtain access to user information for security-related purposes or to censor certain content on our platform, by the use of our products or servicesfor illicit or objectionable ends, including, for example, any such actions around the pandemic or elections in the United States and around the world, by decisionsor recommendations regarding content on our platform from the independent Oversight Board, or by our decisions to remove content or suspend participation onour platform by persons who violate our community standards or terms of service. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will require us to make substantialinvestments and these investments may not be successful. Certain of our past actions, such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concernsaround our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and other content, have eroded confidence in our brands, and if we fail to successfullypromote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and financial results may be adversely affected.We may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook andour other products.We have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build, grow, and monetize mobile and web applications that integrate withFacebook and our other products. Such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building, growing, or monetizing mobile and/or webapplications that create and maintain user engagement. Additionally, developers may choose to build on other platforms, including mobile platforms controlled bythird parties, rather than building products that integrate with Facebook and our other products. We are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectivesof our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience, and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retainsuch developers. For example, from time to time, we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on Facebook andour other products with the objective of enhancing the user experience, and such actions have reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and ourmonetization opportunities from, mobile and web applications integrated with our products. In addition, as part of our efforts related to privacy, safety, andsecurity, we conduct investigations and audits of platform applications from time to time, and we also have announced several product changes that restrictdeveloper access to certain user data. In some instances, these actions, as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers, have adverselyaffected, or will adversely affect, our relationships with developers. If we are not successful in our efforts to maintain or grow the number of developers thatchoose to build products that integrate with Facebook and our other products or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with suchdevelopers, our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected.Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial ResultsThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may in the future have, a significant adverse impact on our advertising revenue and also exposes our business to otherrisks.The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures to contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus, suchas travel bans and restrictions, limitations on business activity, quarantines, and shelter-in-place orders. These measures have caused, and are continuing to cause,business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas, both regionally and worldwide, which have significantly impacted our business and results of operations. Forexample, in the second quarter of 2020, our advertising revenue grew 10% year-over-year, which was the slowest growth rate for any fiscal quarter since our initialpublic offering. While our advertising revenue growth rate improved in subsequent19Table of Contentsquarters, there can be no assurance that it will not decrease again as a result of the effects of the pandemic. In addition, we believe that the pandemic hascontributed to an acceleration in the shift of commerce from offline to online, as well as increasing consumer demand for purchasing products as opposed toservices, which in turn have increased demand for our advertising services; however, it is possible that this increased demand may not continue in future periodsand may even recede as the effects of the pandemic subside, which could adversely affect our advertising revenue growth. The demand for and pricing of ouradvertising services may be materially and adversely impacted by the pandemic for the foreseeable future, and we are unable to predict the duration or degree ofsuch impact with any certainty. In addition to the impact on our advertising business, the pandemic exposes our business, operations, and workforce to a variety ofother risks, including:•volatility in the size of our user base and user engagement, particularly for our messaging products, whether as a result of shelter-in-place measuresor other factors;•decreased user engagement as a result of users' inability to purchase data packs or devices to access our products and services;•interruptions in the accessibility or performance of our products and services due to capacity constraints from increased usage, or product changes weimplement to maintain accessibility of our services, such as reducing the quality of video to reduce bandwidth usage;•delays in product development or releases, or reductions in manufacturing production and sales of consumer hardware, as a result of inventoryshortages, supply chain or labor shortages, or diversion of our efforts and resources to projects related to COVID-19;•increased misuse of our products and services or user data by third parties, including improper advertising practices or other activity inconsistent withour terms, contracts, or policies, misinformation or other illicit or objectionable material on our platforms, election interference, or other undesirableactivity; •adverse impacts to our efforts to combat misuse of our products and services and user data as a result of limitations on our safety, security, andcontent review efforts while our workforce is working remotely, such as the necessity to rely more heavily on artificial intelligence to perform tasksthat our workforce is unable to perform; •our inability to recognize revenue, collect payment, or generate future revenue from marketers, including from those that have been or may be forcedto close their businesses or are otherwise impacted by the economic downturn;•increased expenses resulting from our initiatives or donations related to the pandemic;•significant volatility and disruption of global financial markets, which could cause fluctuations in currency exchange rates or negatively impact ourability to access capital in the future;•negative impact on our workforce productivity, product development, and research and development due to difficulties resulting from our personnelworking remotely; •illnesses to key employees, or a significant portion of our workforce, which may result in inefficiencies, delays, and disruptions in our business; and•increased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates used in our financial statements.Any of these developments may adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory actions against us. The persistence ofCOVID-19, and the preventative measures implemented to help limit the spread of the illness, have impacted, and will continue to impact, our ability to operateour business and may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.We compete with companies providing connection and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies that sell advertising tobusinesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for managing20Table of Contentsand optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, companies that facilitate theability of users to share, communicate, and discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences, including,for example, Google, Apple, YouTube, Tencent, Snap, Twitter, ByteDance, Microsoft, and Amazon. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use ourproducts, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compellingmobile and web applications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual realityproducts and services. As we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, wemay become subject to additional competition.Some of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources or stronger competitive positions in certain product segments, geographic regions,or user demographics than we do. For example, some of our competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political, legal, and regulatoryregimes that enable them to compete more effectively than us. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emergingtechnologies and changes in market conditions. We believe that some users, particularly younger users, are aware of and actively engaging with other products andservices similar to, or as a substitute for, our products and services, and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement with our productsand services in favor of these other products and services. In the event that users increasingly engage with other products and services, we may experience adecline in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly, in which case our business would likely be harmed.Our competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching andsuccessful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Some competitors may gain a competitiveadvantage against us in areas where we operate, including: by making acquisitions; by limiting our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads; byimposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads; by making access to our products more difficult or impossible; by making it more difficult tocommunicate with our users; or by integrating competing platforms, applications, or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems,search engines, browsers, or e-commerce platforms. For example, each of Apple and Google have integrated competitive products with iOS and Android,respectively. In addition, Apple has announced changes to iOS 14 that will limit our ability, and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry, to target andmeasure ads effectively. As a result, our competitors may, and in some cases will, acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at the expenseof our own efforts, which would negatively affect our business and financial results. In addition, from time to time, we may take actions in response to competitivethreats, but we cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results.We believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:•the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our competitors' products;•the size and composition of our user base;•the engagement of users with our products and competing products;•our ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services;•the timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors' products;•our safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their data;•our ability to distribute our products to new and existing users;•our ability to monetize our products;21Table of Contents•the frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;•customer service and support efforts;•marketing and selling efforts, including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide marketers with a compelling return on theirinvestments;•our ability to establish and maintain developers' interest in building mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook and our other products;•our ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with Facebook and our other products;•changes mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us;•acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors;•our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers, designers, and product managers;•our ability to cost-effectively manage and grow our operations; and•our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors.If we are not able to compete effectively, our user base and level of user engagement may decrease, we may become less attractive to developers andmarketers, and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.Unfavorable media coverage negatively affects our business from time to time.We receive a high degree of media coverage around the world. Unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our privacy practices, terms of service,advertising policies, product changes, product quality, litigation or regulatory activity, government surveillance, the actions of our advertisers, the actions of ourdevelopers whose products are integrated with our products, the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends, the substance or enforcement of ourcommunity standards, the actions of our users, the quality and integrity of content shared on our platform, or the actions of other companies that provide similarservices to ours, has in the past, and could in the future, adversely affect our reputation. For example, we have been the subject of significant media coverageinvolving concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and other content, and we continue to receive negative publicity related tothese topics. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be, subject to negative publicity in connection with our handling of misinformation and other illicit orobjectionable use of our products or services, including in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and elections in the United States and around the world. Anysuch negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and loyalty of our user base and marketer demand for advertising on our products,which could result in decreased revenue and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we have experienced such adverse effects to varying degreesfrom time to time.Our financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.Our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future. Additionally, we have a limited operating history with the currentscale of our business, which makes it difficult to forecast our future results. As a result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators offuture performance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets. Our financialresults in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, including:•our ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement;22Table of Contents•our ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period;•our ability to recognize revenue or collect payments from marketers in a particular period, including as a result of the effects of the COVID-19pandemic;•fluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality, such as historically strong spending in the fourth quarter of each year, episodic regionalor global events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors;•the frequency, prominence, size, format, and quality of ads shown to users;•the success of technologies designed to block the display of ads;•changes to third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising, including changes by mobileoperating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;•the pricing of our ads and other products;•the diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on Facebook and Instagram;•our ability to generate revenue from Payments, or the sale of our consumer hardware products or other products we may introduce in the future;•changes to existing products or services or the development and introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors;•user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize;•increases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we will incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive, includingcosts related to our data centers and technical infrastructure;•costs related to our privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts, including as a result of implementing changes to our practices, whethervoluntarily, in connection with laws, regulations, regulatory actions, or decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board, orotherwise;•costs and expenses related to the development and delivery of our consumer hardware products;•our ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins;•costs related to acquisitions, including costs associated with amortization and additional investments to develop the acquired technologies;•charges associated with impairment of any assets on our balance sheet;•our ability to obtain equipment, components, and labor for our data centers and other technical infrastructure in a timely and cost-effective manner;•system failures or outages or government blocking, which could prevent us from serving ads for any period of time;•breaches of security or privacy, and the costs associated with any such breaches and remediation;•changes in the manner in which we distribute our products or inaccessibility of our products due to third-party actions;•fees paid to third parties for content or the distribution of our products;23Table of Contents•refunds or other concessions provided to advertisers;•share-based compensation expense, including acquisition-related expense;•adverse litigation judgments, settlements, or other litigation-related costs;•changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, including with respect to privacy and data protection, or actions by governments or regulators,including fines, orders, or consent decrees;•the overall tax rate for our business, which is affected by the mix of income we earn in the U.S. and in jurisdictions with different tax rates, the effectsof share-based compensation, the effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, the effects of changes in our business or structure, andthe effects of discrete items such as legal and tax settlements and tax elections;•the impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws, which are recorded in the period such laws are enacted orinterpretations are issued, and may significantly affect the effective tax rate of that period;•tax obligations that may arise from resolutions of tax examinations, including the examination we are currently under by the Internal Revenue Service(IRS), that materially differ from the amounts we have anticipated;•fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies;•trading activity in our share repurchase program;•fluctuations in the market values of our investments in marketable securities, in the valuation of our equity investments, and in interest rates;•changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and•changes in regional or global business or macroeconomic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may impact the otherfactors described above.We expect our rates of growth to be volatile in the near term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and to decline over time in the future.We expect our user and revenue growth rates to be volatile in the near term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, although we are unable to predict theduration or degree of such volatility with any certainty. In the long term, we expect that our user growth rate will generally decline over time as the size of ouractive user base increases, and the size of our active user base may fluctuate or decline in one or more markets, particularly as we achieve greater marketpenetration. We also expect our revenue growth rate will continue to decline over time as our revenue increases to higher levels. As our growth rates experiencevolatility or decline, investors' perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline.Our costs are continuing to grow, and some of our investments, particularly our investments in virtual and augmented reality, have the effect of reducing ouroperating margin and profitability. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.Operating our business is costly, and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base, as users increase the amountand types of content they consume and the data they share with us, for example with respect to video, as we develop and implement new products, as we marketnew and existing products and promote our brands, as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure, as we continue to invest in new and unproventechnologies, and as we continue to hire additional employees and contractors to support our expanding operations, including our efforts to focus on privacy,safety, security, and content review. In addition, from time to time we are subject to settlements, judgments,24Table of Contentsfines, or other monetary penalties in connection with legal and regulatory developments that may be material to our business. We are also continuing to increaseour investments in new platforms and technologies. Some of these investments, particularly our significant investments in virtual and augmented reality, havegenerated only limited revenue and reduced our operating margin and profitability, and we expect the adverse financial impact of such investments to continue forthe foreseeable future. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.We plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions, which could harm our financial condition or results of operations and mayadversely affect the price of our common stock.As part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies,products, or technologies, and from time to time may enter into other strategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures. We may not be able to findsuitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions on favorable terms, if at all, including as a result ofregulatory challenges. In some cases, the costs of such acquisitions or other strategic transactions may be substantial, and there is no assurance that we will receivea favorable return on investment for our acquisitions or other strategic transactions.We may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions or other strategic transactions, which has occurred in the past and couldadversely affect our liquidity. The incurrence of indebtedness would also result in increased fixed obligations and increased interest expense, and could alsoinclude covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and weregularly grant RSUs to retain the employees of acquired companies, which could increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial results, and result indilution to our stockholders. In addition, any acquisitions or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by users, marketers, developers,or investors, which may adversely affect our business or the price of our Class A common stock.We may also discover liabilities, deficiencies, or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance, whichmay result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence aredependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives, as wellas the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or otherstrategic transaction, including tax and accounting charges. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may also result in our recording of significant additionalexpenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing. Any of these factors mayadversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.We may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire.The integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, and we may not manage these processes successfully. Our ability to successfullyintegrate complex acquisitions is unproven, particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not haveprior experience. We continue to make substantial investments of resources to support our acquisitions, which will result in significant ongoing operating expensesand may divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We cannot assure you that these investments will be successful. If we fail tosuccessfully integrate the companies we acquire, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.Our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption in our service, including as a resultof the COVID-19 pandemic, could damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of users and engagement, and adversely affect our financial results.Our reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technicalinfrastructure. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, interruptions in the availability or performance of our products from time totime. Our systems may not be adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delays or outages thatcould be harmful to our business. If our products are unavailable when users attempt to access them, or if they do not load as quickly as expected, users may notuse our products as often in the future, or at all, and our ability to serve ads may be25Table of Contentsdisrupted, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. As the amount and types of information shared on Facebook and our otherproducts continue to grow and evolve, as the usage patterns of our global community continue to evolve, and as our internal operational demands continue to grow,we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to satisfy our needs. It is possible thatwe may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands, which may adversely affect our userengagement and advertising revenue growth. In addition, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures resulting from earthquakes, adverseweather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism, geopolitical conflict, other physical security threats, cyber-attacks, or other catastrophic events. Ifsuch an event were to occur, users may be subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in atimely manner to restart or provide our services, which may adversely affect our financial results.For example, the increase in the use of our products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic increased demands on our technical infrastructure. Additionalproduct development efforts during this time have put additional pressure on our technical infrastructure. We may not be able to accommodate these demands,including as a result of our reduced data center operations and personnel working remotely during the pandemic.A substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties. Any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providerscould harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face mayadversely affect our business, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. Theeffects of the COVID-19 pandemic have increased the risk of supply or labor shortages or other disruptions in logistics or the supply chain for our technicalinfrastructure. As a result, we may not be able to procure sufficient equipment or services from third parties to satisfy our needs, or we may be required to procuresuch services or equipment on unfavorable terms.Any of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products, require unfavorable changes to existing products,delay the introduction of future products, or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.We could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure.We have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products, and we plan tocontinue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers, subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems, and other projects.The infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations around the world, including in emerging markets thatexpose us to increased risks relating to anti-corruption compliance and political challenges, among others. We have in the past suspended, and may in the futuresuspend, certain of these projects as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional unanticipated delays or disruptions in the completion of these projects,including due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portions of such projects, or availability of components, challenges in obtaining required governmentor regulatory approvals, or other geopolitical challenges or actions by governments, whether as a result of the pandemic, trade disputes, or otherwise, may lead toincreased project costs, operational inefficiencies, interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality or reliability of our products, or impairment of assetson our balance sheet. In addition, there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation,which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment, that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs.Further, much of our technical infrastructure is located outside the United States, and it is possible that action by a foreign government, or our response to suchgovernment action, could result in the impairment of a portion of our technical infrastructure, which may interrupt the delivery or degrade the quality or reliabilityof our products and lead to a negative user experience or increase our costs. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.Real or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.The numbers for our key metrics, which include our Facebook metrics (DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU)) and Family metrics (DAP,MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP)), are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts. While these numbers are basedon what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of ourproducts across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these metrics require26Table of Contentssignificant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our userbase, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, andfrom time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics.Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for suchadjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error marginsdisclosed below.In addition, our Facebook metrics and Family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology.We regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics to estimate the number of "duplicate" and "false" accounts among our MAUs. A duplicate account is one that auser maintains in addition to his or her principal account. We divide "false" accounts into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where users have createdpersonal profiles for a business, organization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on Facebook using a Page rather than a personal profileunder our terms of service); and (2) violating accounts, which represent user profiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms ofservice, such as bots and spam. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts, and we applysignificant judgment in making this determination. For example, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical IP addresses and similar usernames, and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers. Any loss of access todata signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislativerequirements, limitations while our personnel work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of ourestimates of duplicate and false accounts. Our estimates also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals ortechnologies or product changes that may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broaderpopulation of our users. Duplicate and false accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and falseaccounts may vary significantly from our estimates.In the fourth quarter of 2020, we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11% of our worldwide MAUs. We believe thepercentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as the Philippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets. Inthe fourth quarter of 2020, we estimated that false accounts may have represented approximately 5% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of false accounts canvary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries such as Indonesia andVietnam. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accountsamong our users, which may also reduce our DAU and MAU estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the number of duplicate andfalse accounts among our MAUs on an annual basis.Many people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individualproduct. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would notreflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook,Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, andtherefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complextechniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user accountswithin an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of accounts as oneperson. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject to statisticalvariances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data, which itself is subject to error as well. Whilewe expect the error margin for our Family metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 4% of ourworldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that theactual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it isalso possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.27Table of ContentsTo calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews oflimited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates.For example, to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses,and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which are inherentlysubject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in our reported Familymetrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for ourFamily metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limited data signals for someproducts compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user accounts andprimarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts on our other products. Similarly, although MessengerKids users are included in our Family metrics, we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of calculating DAP andMAP. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, limitations while our personnel work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, or otherfactors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported Family metrics. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve,including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or machine learningthat may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In addition, such evolutionmay allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).We regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of "violating" accounts. We define "violating" accountsas accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of 2020, weestimated that approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sampleof accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look for account information and behaviors associated withFacebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to encryption. Inaddition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as webelieve they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take otheractions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP and MAP estimates in a particular period. We intend todisclose our estimates of the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure atour scale, and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.Other data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while user-provided data indicates a decline inusage among younger users, this age data is unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age. Accordingly, ourunderstanding of usage by age group may not be complete.In addition, our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user's IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing Facebook from thelocation of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptibleto algorithm or other technical errors, and our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors.In addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics and estimates, including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads.Many of our metrics involve the use of estimations and judgments, and our metrics and estimates are subject to software bugs, inconsistencies in our systems, andhuman error. Where marketers, developers, or investors do not perceive our metrics or estimates to be accurate, or where we discover material inaccuracies in ourmetrics or estimates, we may be subject to liability, our reputation may be harmed, and marketers and developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets orresources to Facebook or our other products, which could negatively affect our business and financial results.28Table of ContentsWe cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth.Our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly, with the number of employees increasing to 58,604 asof December 31, 2020 from 44,942 as of December 31, 2019, and we expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future. In addition, we plan tocontinue to hire a number of employees and contractors to continue to bolster various privacy, safety, security, and content review initiatives as well as otherfunctions to support our expected growth. The growth and expansion of our business and products create significant challenges for our management, operational,and financial resources, including managing multiple relationships with users, marketers, developers, and other third parties. As our operations and the number ofour third-party relationships continue to grow, our information technology systems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support suchgrowth. In addition, some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation, so our management maynot be able to manage such growth effectively. Additionally, the vast majority of our personnel are currently working remotely as a result of the COVID-19pandemic, which limits their ability to perform certain job functions and may negatively impact productivity. In the long term, we may experience such challengesto productivity and collaboration as some personnel transition to working remotely on a regular basis, and we may experience difficulties integrating recently hiredpersonnel when our offices re-open. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to adapt to a remote work environment; improve our operational,financial, and management processes and systems; and effectively expand, train, and manage our personnel. As our organization continues to grow, and we arerequired to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture,including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. This could negatively affect our business performance.We have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have more limited operating experience, andthis may subject us to increased business, economic, and legal risks that could affect our financial results.We have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business operations and the translation of our products.We currently make Facebook available in more than 100 different languages, and we have offices or data centers in more than 30 different countries. We may enternew international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our products. Our products are generally available globally,but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain markets due to legal and regulatory complexities. For example, Facebook andcertain of our other products are not generally available in China. We also outsource certain operational functions to third-party vendors globally. If we fail todeploy, manage, or oversee our international operations successfully, our business may suffer. In addition, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doingbusiness internationally, including:•political, social, or economic instability;•risks related to legal, regulatory, and other government scrutiny applicable to U.S. companies with sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions,including with respect to privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, trade compliance, competition, consumer protection, intellectual property, andinfrastructure matters;•potential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or requirements to provide userinformation to local authorities;•enhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards across different languages and countries;•fluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls;•foreign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the UnitedStates or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely, and impede our ability to invest such cash efficiently;•higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;29Table of Contents•enhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;•burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including laws related to taxation, content removal, data localization, payments, and regulatoryoversight;•reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;•difficulties in staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associatedwith multiple international locations, including difficulties arising from personnel working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic;•compliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences; and•geopolitical events affecting us, our marketers or our industry, including trade disputes and pandemics.In addition, we must manage the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices in any given jurisdiction and our obligations to comply withlaws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws or regulations applicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010.We also must manage our obligations to comply with laws and regulations related to export controls, sanctions, and embargoes, including regulations establishedby the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Government agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to imposeagainst companies for violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations, export controls, and other laws, rules, sanctions, embargoes, and regulations.If we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our financial results could be adverselyaffected.We face design, manufacturing, and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could adversely impact our financial results.We face a number of risks related to design, manufacturing, and supply chain management with respect to our consumer hardware products. For example,the consumer hardware products we sell from time to time have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of theproducts, or from the software used in the products. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers.Our brand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues, other failures to meet our customers' expectations, or findings of ourconsumer hardware products to be defective.We rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer hardware products, which subjects us to anumber of risks that have been exacerbated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We may experience supply or labor shortages or other disruptions in logisticsor the supply chain that could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations, product development, and sales. We could be negatively affected ifwe are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations(whether due to financial difficulties, manufacturing constraints, or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of sucharrangements with them. The manufacturing, distribution, and sale of our consumer hardware products also may be negatively impacted by macroeconomicconditions, geopolitical challenges, trade disputes, or other actions by governments that subject us to supply shortages, increased costs, or supply chain disruptions.We also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and certain company policies regardingsourcing practices and standards on labor, health and safety, the environment, and business ethics, but we do not control them or their practices and standards. Ifany of them violates laws, fails to implement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws, or implements practices or standards regarded as unethical, corrupt,or non-compliant, we could experience supply chain disruptions, government action or fines, canceled orders, or damage to our reputation.We face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products.We are exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in30Table of Contentsproduct cycles and pricing, unsafe or defective merchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes withrespect to our consumer hardware products, and other factors. The demand for our products can also change significantly between the time inventory orcomponents are ordered and the date of sale. While we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking consumer hardwareproducts we may sell, from time to time we have experienced difficulties in accurately predicting and meeting the consumer demand for our products. In addition,when we begin selling or manufacturing a new consumer hardware product or enter new international markets, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships,determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may requiresignificant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. Any one of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our operating results.We are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming, and, if resolved adversely, could harmour business, financial condition, or results of operations.We are involved in numerous lawsuits, including stockholder derivative lawsuits and putative class action lawsuits, many of which claim statutorydamages and/or seek significant changes to our business operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future.Because of the scale of our user, advertiser, and developer base, the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damageseven if the alleged per-user or entity harm is small or non-existent. In addition, we have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to additional class actionlawsuits based on claims related to advertising, antitrust, privacy, content, employment, or product performance or other claims related to the use of consumerhardware and software, as well as virtual reality technology and products, which are new and unproven. For example, we are currently the subject of multipleputative class action suits in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with thirdparties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; and our acquisitions of Instagram andWhatsApp, as well as other alleged anticompetitive conduct. We also agreed to settle certain lawsuits in connection with the "tag suggestions" facial recognitionfeature on Facebook and a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens and access certain profileinformation from user accounts on Facebook. The results of any such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and any negative outcome from anysuch lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or undesirable changes to our products or business practices, and accordingly ourbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.There can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a significantburden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed uponappeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which has occurred in the pastand which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations.We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.Our tax obligations, including income and non-income taxes, are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements,including the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage, protect, and use our intellectual property, and the valuations of our intercompanytransactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation and certainjurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as Facebook. We are subject toregular review and audit by U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, including ourmethodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwideeffective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Forexample, in 2016 and 2018, the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the2010 through 2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS's position and are litigating this issue, the ultimate resolution is uncertain and, if resolved in amanner unfavorable to us, may adversely affect our financial results.The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are manytransactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business, andany changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes andestimates of31Table of Contentsour non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affectour financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.Our future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit split, changes in the amount and recognition ofdeferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles.Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be subject to significant change.Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cashflows. For example, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate forthe fourth quarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the Tax Act, or other executive or Congressional actions in theUnited States, could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued or such actions take effect. In addition, manycountries in Europe, as well as a number of other countries and organizations, have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or haveenacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which weoperate our business.The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, and issued a report in 2015,an interim report in 2018, and blueprints in 2020 that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations aredetermined in many of the countries in which we do business. Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals that would apply tovarious aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as wellas proposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, several countries have proposedor enacted taxes applicable to digital services, which includes business activities on social media platforms and online marketplaces, and which apply to ourbusiness.The European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation providespreferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and concluded that certain countries, including Ireland, have provided illegal state aid incertain cases. These investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations.Due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities described abovecould increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results ofoperations, and cash flows. Such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts estimated andrecorded in our financial statements.Given our levels of share-based compensation, our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price.The tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from period to period. In periods in which ourstock price is higher than the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, we will recognize excess tax benefits that will decrease oureffective tax rate. For example, in 2020, excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $656 millionand our effective tax rate by two percentage points as compared to the tax rate without such benefits. In future periods in which our stock price is lower than thegrant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, our effective tax rate may increase. The amount and value of share-based compensation issuedrelative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share-based compensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effectsare dependent on our stock price, which we do not control, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affectour financial results.32Table of ContentsIf our goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.We review our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable,such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. If such goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets aredeemed to be impaired, an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized. We may berequired to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets isdetermined, which would negatively affect our results of operations.The loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business.We currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl K. Sandberg. Although wehave entered into employment agreements with Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg, the agreements have no specific duration and constitute at-will employment. Inaddition, many of our key technologies and systems are custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including members ofmanagement as well as key engineering, product development, marketing, and sales personnel, could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on ourbusiness.As we continue to grow, we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position. Inparticular, we intend to continue to hire a significant number of technical personnel in the foreseeable future, and we expect to continue to face significantchallenges in hiring such personnel, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters are located, whether as a result of competition with othercompanies, challenges due to the high cost of living, facilities and infrastructure constraints, or other factors. As we continue to mature, the incentives to attract,retain, and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past, and if we issue significant equity toattract additional employees or to retain our existing employees, we would incur substantial additional share-based compensation expense and the ownership of ourexisting stockholders would be further diluted. Our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility. As aresult of these factors, it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate our employees. If we do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integratingexcellent personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be unable to grow effectively.Our CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock.Mark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstandingcapital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and anymerger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger,consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in theconsummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiringour Class A common stock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common stock, and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock.In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our CEO andhis ability to control the election or, in some cases, the replacement of our directors. In the event of his death, the shares of our capital stock that Mr. Zuckerbergowns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated. As a board member and officer, Mr. Zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholdersand must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder,Mr. Zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control as governed by a voting agreement, in his own interests, which may notalways be in the interests of our stockholders generally.We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. Share repurchasescould also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves.33Table of ContentsAlthough our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date, the program does not obligate us torepurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of our Class A common stock. We cannot guarantee that the program will befully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. The program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and anyannouncement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this program will diminish our cash reserves.Risks Related to Government Regulation and EnforcementActions by governments that restrict access to Facebook or our other products in their countries, or that otherwise impair our ability to sell advertising in theircountries, could substantially harm our business and financial results.Governments from time to time seek to censor content available on Facebook or our other products in their country, restrict access to our products from theircountry entirely, or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely. Forexample, user access to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in China, Iran, and North Korea. Inaddition, government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws or a threat topublic safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries from time to time. For example, in June 2020,Hong Kong adopted a National Security Law that provides authorities with the ability to obtain information, remove and block access to content, and suspend userservices, and if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted. In addition, if we are required to or elect to make changesto our marketing and sales or other operations in Hong Kong as a result of the National Security Law, our revenue and business in the region will be adverselyaffected. It is also possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising, including in countries where access to ourconsumer-facing products may be blocked or restricted. For example, we generate meaningful revenue from a limited number of resellers representing advertisersbased in China, and it is possible that the Chinese government could take action that reduces or eliminates our China-based advertising revenue, whether as a resultof the trade dispute with the United States, in response to content issues or information requests in Hong Kong or elsewhere, or for other reasons, or take otheraction against us, such as imposing taxes or other penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results. Similarly, if we are found to be out of compliancewith certain legal requirements for social media companies in Turkey, the Turkish government could take action to reduce or eliminate our Turkey-basedadvertising revenue or otherwise adversely impact access to our products. In the event that content shown on Facebook or our other products is subject tocensorship, access to our products is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, we are required to or elect to make changes to our operations, or otherrestrictions are imposed on our products, or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existinggeographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our ability to retain or increase our user base, user engagement, or the level ofadvertising by marketers may be adversely affected, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated, and our financial results could beadversely affected.Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use and data protection, content, competition,consumer protection, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in claims,changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines in user growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including privacy, data use,data protection and personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention anddeletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, artificial intelligence, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors,consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, anti-corruption and politicallaw compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, orother actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, foreign data protection, privacy, content,competition, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States.These U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, areconstantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are oftenuncertain, particularly in the new and34Table of Contentsrapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our currentpolicies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users or obtain consent to variouspractices could adversely affect user growth and engagement. Such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect ourfinancial results.We are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receive certaindata that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services. Forexample, in 2016, the European Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the United States, calledthe Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases uponwhich Facebook relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example,the CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States following a challenge brought by the IrishData Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, our continued reliance on SCCs is contingent on SCCs beingheld to satisfy certain new conditions that are yet to be clearly defined and will be the subject of future regulatory guidance (and the European Commission hasrecently proposed new SCCs, which are currently subject to consultation). In addition, in August 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from the IDPC thatpreliminarily concluded that Facebook Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of European user data does not achieve compliance with the GDPR and preliminarilyproposed that such transfers of user data from the European Union to the United States should therefore be suspended. Facebook Ireland challenged proceduralaspects of this IDPC inquiry in a judicial review commenced in the Irish High Court in September 2020, and the court ordered the IDPC not to take further steps inrespect of the inquiry until the judicial review proceedings conclude (subject to the IDPC's right to apply to vary or lift this order), which we expect to occur in thecoming months. While we also rely upon alternative legal bases for data transfers, if a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unableto continue to rely on SCCs or validly rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from Europe to the United States, we may be unable to operate materialportions of our business in Europe as a result of the CJEU's invalidation of the Privacy Shield and any final decision of IDPC, which would materially andadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We have also been managing investigations and lawsuits in Europe, India, and otherjurisdictions regarding the August 2016 update to WhatsApp's terms of service and privacy policy and its sharing of certain data with other Facebook products andservices, including a lawsuit currently pending before the Supreme Court of India. If we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions inwhich we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in whichwe provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results.Proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR) took effect in May 2018 and applies to all of our products and services used by people in Europe. The GDPR includes operational requirements forcompanies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are different from those previously in place in the European Union. As aresult, we implemented measures to change our service for minors under the age of 16 for certain countries in Europe that maintain the minimum age of 16 underthe GDPR. We also obtain consent and/or offer new controls to existing and new users in Europe before processing data for certain aspects of our service. Inaddition, the GDPR requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our designated European privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significantpenalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. Similarly, the Brazilian General Data Protection Lawrecently took effect and imposes data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in Brazil. The California Consumer Privacy Act(CCPA), which took effect in January 2020, also establishes certain transparency rules and creates new data privacy rights for users, including more ability tocontrol how their data is shared with third parties. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertisingservices, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. Forexample, regulators have recently issued new guidance concerning the ePrivacy Directive's requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies. Inaddition, effective December 2020, the ePrivacy Directive includes additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and includes significantpenalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of these developments may adversely affect our advertising business.Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions thatcould impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementingdata protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering ourservices.35Table of ContentsThese laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any other government actions, have in the past led to, and may inthe future lead to, unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs, delays or impediments in the development of new products, negative publicity andreputational harm, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm our business, including fines or demands ororders that we modify or cease existing business practices.We have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and we expect to continue to be subject to suchproceedings and other inquiries in the future, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a mannermaterially adverse to our business.From time to time, we receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws andregulations, many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation. We are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests,requests for information, actions, and audits in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, lawenforcement, consumer protection, and competition, as we continue to grow and expand our operations. In addition, we are currently, and may in the future be,subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees. For example, data protection, competition, and consumer protection authorities in the European Union and otherjurisdictions have initiated actions, investigations, or administrative orders seeking to restrict the ways in which we collect and use information, or imposesanctions, and other authorities may do the same. In addition, beginning in March 2018, we became subject to FTC, state attorneys general, and other governmentinquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by adeveloper that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order toresolve the FTC inquiry, which was approved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC required us topay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. Beginning in September 2018, we alsobecame subject to IDPC and other government inquiries in connection with a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal useraccess tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook. From time to time we also notify the IDPC, our designated European privacyregulator under the GDPR, of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations regarding various aspects ofour regulatory compliance.In addition, from time to time, we are subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition authorities in theUnited States, Europe, and other jurisdictions, which relate to many aspects of our business, including with respect to users and advertisers, as well as our industry.Such inquiries, investigations, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, digitaladvertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as past acquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened anantitrust investigation of our company. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust inquiries and investigations by theU.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. House of Representatives, and state attorneys general. In December 2020, the FTC and the attorneys general from 46 states,the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia filed complaints against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we violatedantitrust laws by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform, among other things. The lawsuits ofthe FTC and attorneys general both seek a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, includingdivestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp.Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose usto unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in amanner materially adverse to our business, result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from ourbusiness, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business, and we have experienced some of these adverse effects tovarying degrees from time to time.36Table of ContentsCompliance with our FTC consent order, the GDPR, the CCPA, the ePrivacy Directive, and other regulatory and legislative privacy requirements requiresignificant operational resources and modifications to our business practices, and any compliance failures may have a material adverse effect on our business,reputation, and financial results.We are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with our modified consent order with the FTC, requirementsof the GDPR, and other regulatory and legislative requirements around the world, such as the CCPA and the ePrivacy Directive. In particular, we are implementinga comprehensive expansion of our privacy program in connection with the FTC consent order, including substantial management and board of directors oversight,stringent operational requirements and reporting obligations, prohibitions against making misrepresentations relating to user data, a process to regularly certify ourcompliance with the privacy program to the FTC, and regular assessments of our privacy program by an independent third-party assessor, which has been and willcontinue to be challenging and costly to implement. These compliance and oversight efforts are increasing demand on our systems and resources, and requiresignificant new and ongoing investments, including investments in compliance processes, personnel, and technical infrastructure. We are reallocating resourcesinternally to assist with these efforts, and this has had, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our other business initiatives. In addition, these effortsrequire substantial modifications to our business practices and make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming, andcostly. As a result, we believe our ability to develop and launch new features, products, and services in a timely manner has been and will continue to be adverselyaffected. We also expect that our privacy compliance and oversight efforts will require significant time and attention from our management and board of directors.The requirements of the FTC consent order and other privacy-related laws and regulations are complex and apply broadly to our business, and from time to timewe notify relevant authorities of instances where we are not in full compliance with these requirements or otherwise discover privacy issues, and we expect tocontinue to do so as any such issues arise in the future. In addition, regulatory and legislative privacy requirements are constantly evolving and can be subject tosignificant change and uncertain interpretation. If we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the mandates of the FTC consent order, GDPR,CCPA, ePrivacy Directive, or other regulatory or legislative requirements, or if we are found to be in violation of the consent order or other applicablerequirements, we may be subject to regulatory or governmental investigations or lawsuits, which may result in significant monetary fines, judgments, or otherpenalties, and we may also be required to make additional changes to our business practices. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, reputation, and financial results.We may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet or published using our products or as a result of claims relatedto our products, and legislation regulating content on our platform may require us to change our products or business practices and may adversely affect ourbusiness and financial results.We have faced, currently face, and will continue to face claims relating to information or content that is published or made available on our products,including our policies and enforcement actions with respect to such information or content. In particular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related todefamation, dissemination of misinformation or news hoaxes, discrimination, harassment, intellectual property rights, rights of publicity and privacy, personalinjury torts, laws regulating hate speech or other types of content, and breach of contract, among others. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside theUnited States where our protection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear or where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in theUnited States. For example, in April 2019, the European Union passed a directive expanding online platform liability for copyright infringement and regulatingcertain uses of news content online, which member states are required to implement by June 2021. In addition, the European Union revised the EuropeanAudiovisual Media Service Directive to apply to online video-sharing platforms, which member states are expected to implement by 2021. In the United States,there have been, and continue to be, various Congressional and executive efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available to online platformsunder Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, as well as to impose new obligations on online platforms with respect to commerce listings, counterfeitgoods and copyright-infringing material, and our current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change. We couldincur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages. We could also face fines, orders restricting orblocking our services in particular geographies, or other government-imposed remedies as a result of content hosted on our services. For example, legislation inGermany has in the past, and may in the future, result in the imposition of fines for failure to comply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation,and disclosure obligations. Numerous other countries in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposingpenalties, including fines, service throttling, or advertising bans, for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes. For example, we havebeen subject to fines and may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media legislation in Turkey. In addition, Australia recentlyannounced proposed legislation that would, among other matters, require us to pay publishers for certain37Table of Contentsnews content that is shared on Facebook and Instagram. Content-related legislation also has required us in the past, and may require us in the future, to change ourproducts or business practices, increase our compliance costs, or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain geographies. Forexample, the European Copyright Directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations for copyrighted content or to implement measures to preventthe availability of that content, which may require us to make substantial investments in compliance processes. In addition, changes to Section 230 of theCommunications Decency Act may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affectuser growth and engagement. Any of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and financial results.Payment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harmour business.Our users can purchase virtual and digital goods from developers that offer applications using our Payments infrastructure on the Facebook website. Inaddition, certain of our users can use our Payments infrastructure, including on Messenger and WhatsApp, for other activities, such as sending money to otherusers and making donations to certain charitable organizations. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere,including those governing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, money transmission, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronicfunds transfer, charitable fundraising, and import and export restrictions. Depending on how our Payments product evolves, we may also be subject to other lawsand regulations including those governing gambling, banking, and lending. In some jurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations isnot clear. To increase flexibility in how our use of Payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty, we have received certain money transmitterlicenses in the United States and an Electronic Money (E-money) license that allows us to conduct certain regulated payment activities in the participating membercountries of the European Economic Area, which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas. Ourefforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance. Inthe event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements, we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a ceaseand desist order, or we may be required to make product changes, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.In addition, we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of Payments transactions, including: increased costs and diversion of management timeand effort and other resources to deal with bad transactions or customer disputes; potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users, developers, employees,or third parties; restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact Payments; and additional disclosure and reporting requirements. We have alsolaunched certain payments functionality on WhatsApp and have announced plans to develop digital payments products and services, which may subject us to manyof the foregoing risks and additional licensing requirements.Our participation in the Diem Association subjects us to significant regulatory scrutiny and other risks that could adversely affect our business, reputation, orfinancial results.In June 2019, we announced our participation in the Diem Association, which will oversee a proposed digital payments system powered by blockchaintechnology, and our plans for Novi, a digital wallet for Diem which we expect to launch as a standalone application and subsequently in Messenger and WhatsApp.Diem is based on relatively new and unproven technology, and the laws and regulations surrounding blockchain-based payments are uncertain and evolving.Diem has drawn significant scrutiny from governments and regulators in multiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue. As a sponsor of theinitiative and a proposed digital wallet service provider, we are participating in responses to inquiries from governments and regulators, and adverse government orregulatory actions or negative publicity resulting from such participation may adversely affect our reputation and harm our business.As this initiative evolves, both Diem and Novi may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions,including those governing payments, financial services, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorism financing, economic sanctions, data protection, tax, andcompetition. In many jurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear, particularly with respect to evolving laws andregulations that are applied to blockchain and digital payments. To mitigate regulatory uncertainty, Diem has applied for a payment system operator license withthe Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), and Novi has applied for money38Table of Contentstransmitter licenses in the United States and certain other countries, and other financial services licenses in certain other countries, that would allow us to conductdigital wallet activities in these countries using the Diem network. These licenses, laws, and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations, maydelay or impede the launch of the Diem digital payments system as well as the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs, requiresignificant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business.In addition, market acceptance of such a digital payments system is subject to significant uncertainty. As such, there can be no assurance that Diem or ourassociated products and services will be made available in a timely manner, or at all. We do not have significant prior experience with blockchain-based paymentstechnology, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and services. We will also incur increased costs inconnection with our participation in the Diem Association and the development and marketing of associated products and services, and our investments may not besuccessful. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.Risks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual PropertySecurity breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, or other cyber incidents couldharm our reputation and adversely affect our business.Our industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users' data or to disrupt our ability to provide service. Ourproducts and services involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of a large amount of data. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breachesand improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, including personal information, content, or payment information from users, or information frommarketers, could result in the loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, or other misuse of such data, which could harm our business and reputation and diminishour competitive position. In addition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (predominantly spear phishing attacks), scraping, and general hacking havebecome more prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems in the past, and will occur on our systems in the future. We also regularly encounter attemptsto create false or undesirable user accounts, purchase ads, or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming, spreading misinformation, or otherobjectionable ends. As a result of our prominence, the size of our user base, the types and volume of personal data and content on our systems, and the evolvingnature of our products and services (including our efforts involving new and emerging technologies), we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for suchbreaches and attacks, including from nation states and highly sophisticated, state-sponsored, or otherwise well-funded actors. Our efforts to address undesirableactivity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attacks. Such breaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide, degrade the userexperience, cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products, impair our internal systems, or result in financial harm to us. Our efforts toprotect our company data or the information we receive, and to disable undesirable activities on our platform, may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs orother technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance, including defects or vulnerabilities in our vendors' information technologysystems or offerings; government surveillance; breaches of physical security of our facilities or technical infrastructure; or other threats that evolve. In addition,third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users' data. Cyber-attackscontinue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we have developed systems andprocesses that are designed to protect our data and user data, to prevent data loss, to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform, and to prevent ordetect security breaches, we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security, that we will be able to react in a timely manner, or that ourremediation efforts will be successful.In addition, some of our developers or other partners, such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads, may receive or store information providedby us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with Facebook. We provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope ofservices provided to us. However, if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of theirnetworks, our data or our users' data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed.We experience such cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time, and we incur significant costs in protecting against orremediating such incidents. In addition, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and dataprotection, as well as obligations under our modified consent order with the FTC. As a result, affected users or government authorities could initiate legal orregulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches or improper access to or disclosure of data,39Table of Contentswhich has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify ourbusiness practices. Such incidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may also result in a decline in our active user base or engagement levels. Any of theseevents could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation, or financial results.For example, in September 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal useraccess tokens, which were then used to access certain profile information from approximately 29 million user accounts on Facebook. The events surrounding thiscyber-attack became the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission and other government inquiries. Any such inquiries could subject us to substantial fines andcosts, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.In addition, the changes in our work environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the security of our systems, as well as our ability toprotect against attacks and detect and respond to them quickly. The rapid adoption of some third-party services designed to enable the transition to a remoteworkforce also may introduce security risk that is not fully mitigated prior to the use of these services. We may also be subject to increased cyber-attacks, such asphishing attacks by threat actors using the attention placed on the pandemic as a method for targeting our personnel.We anticipate that our ongoing efforts related to privacy, safety, security, and content review will identify additional instances of misuse of user data or otherundesirable activity by third parties on our platform.In addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks, we are making significant investments in privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts tocombat misuse of our services and user data by third parties, including investigations and audits of platform applications. As a result of these efforts we havediscovered and announced, and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce, additional incidents of misuse of user data or other undesirable activityby third parties. We may not discover all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data or technical limitations, including our lack of visibility over ourencrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, challenges related to our personnel working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, the allocation ofresources to other projects, or other factors, and we may be notified of such incidents or activity by the independent privacy assessor required under our modifiedconsent order with the FTC, the media, or other third parties. Such incidents and activities have in the past, and may in the future, include the use of user data orour systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improperadvertising practices, activities that threaten people's safety on- or offline, or instances of spamming, scraping, data harvesting, unsecured datasets, or spreadingmisinformation. We may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate any such incidents. Any of the foregoing developmentsmay negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation and brands, require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business,and adversely affect our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which couldsubject us to monetary penalties and damages, divert management's time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.Our products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities in these systems, or failuresto address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems, could adversely affect our business.Our products and internal systems rely on software and hardware, including software and hardware developed or maintained internally and/or by thirdparties, that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store, retrieve,process, and manage immense amounts of data. The software and hardware on which we rely has contained, and will in the future contain, errors, bugs, orvulnerabilities, and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise our ability to meet our objectives. Some errors, bugs, orvulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. For example, inSeptember 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens and accesscertain profile information from user accounts on Facebook. Errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, design defects, or technical limitations within the software and hardwareon which we rely have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including a negative experience for users and marketers who use our products,compromised ability of our products to perform in a manner consistent with our terms, contracts, or policies, delayed product introductions or enhancements,targeting, measurement, or billing errors, compromised ability to protect the data of our users and/or our intellectual property or other data, or reductions in ourability to provide some or all of our services. For example, we make commitments to our users as to how their data will40Table of Contentsbe used within and across our products, and our systems are subject to errors, bugs and technical limitations that may prevent us from fulfilling these commitmentsreliably. In addition, any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we rely, failures to properly address ormitigate the technical limitations in our systems, or associated degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our commitments to our users, have inthe past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of marketers, loss of revenue, regulatory inquiries,litigation, or liability for fines, damages, or other remedies, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adverselyaffected.We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and thirdparties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights.In the United States and internationally, we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property, and we currently hold asignificant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties. Thirdparties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future trademarkand patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate orintend to operate our business. In any or all of these cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or toenforce our rights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that others will not offer products orconcepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. In addition, we regularly contribute software source code under open source licensesand have made other technology we developed available under other open licenses, and we include open source software in our products. As a result of our opensource contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to license or disclose code and/or innovations that turn out to bematerial to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use orappropriation by third parties, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic ourproducts, services, and methods of operations. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.We are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consumingand, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.Companies in the Internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and frequently enterinto litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various "non-practicing entities" that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technologycompanies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas where we historically have not competed, which couldincrease our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and non-practicing entities.From time to time, we receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and services, or user content, infringe theirintellectual property rights. We presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasinglyhigh profile, we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow. Defending patent and other intellectual property litigation iscostly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in allcases. In addition, plaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation, including potentialpreliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations. We may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us.Similarly, if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. Theterms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, we mayhave to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party's rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and maysignificantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or41Table of Contentspractices or discontinue the practices. The development of alternative non-infringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense, couldresult in less effective technology or practices or otherwise negatively affect the user experience, or may not be feasible. We have experienced unfavorableoutcomes in such disputes and litigation in the past, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of anunfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common StockThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.The trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our Class A common stock were sold inour initial public offering in May 2012 at a price of $38.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from $17.55 to $304.67 through December 31, 2020. In addition tothe factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerousfactors, many of which are beyond our control, including:•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results;•the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet these projections;•actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow ourcompany, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;•additional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us, our existing stockholders, or in connection with acquisitions, or the anticipation ofsuch sales;•investor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures,or capital commitments;•announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base, the level of user engagement, or theeffectiveness of our ad products;•changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry, including our developers and competitors;•price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;•the inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&P 500 Index;•media coverage of our business and financial performance;•lawsuits threatened or filed against us, or developments in pending lawsuits;•adverse government actions or legislative or regulatory developments relating to advertising, competition, content, privacy, or other matters,including interim or final rulings by tax, judicial, or regulatory bodies;•trading activity in our share repurchase program; and•other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, and other disruptive external events, or responses tothese events.42Table of ContentsIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equitysecurities of many technology companies. We are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse ofcertain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, as well as the disclosure of our earnings results for thesecond quarter of 2018. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. Any securities litigation could subject us to substantialcosts, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.We do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansionof our business and fund our share repurchase program, and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, you mayonly receive a return on your investment in our Class A common stock if the trading price of your shares increases.The dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control with ourCEO and certain other holders of our Class B common stock; this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters.Our Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Stockholders who hold shares of Class Bcommon stock, including certain of our executive officers, employees, and directors and their affiliates, together hold a substantial majority of the voting power ofour outstanding capital stock. Because of the ten-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stockcollectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders forapproval so long as the shares of Class B common stock represent at least 9.1% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. Thisconcentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.Transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, suchas certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the effect,over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example,Mr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, continue to control amajority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock.Our status as a "controlled company" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.Because we qualify as a "controlled company" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, we are not required to have a majority ofour board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. In the future we could electnot to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. Accordingly,should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded tostockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could makeour Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.Delaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, therebydepressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a changein control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes aninterested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our current restated certificate of incorporation andbylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:•until the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the43Table of Contentscombined voting power of our common stock, any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of amajority of our outstanding Class B common stock voting as a separate class;•we currently have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mr. Zuckerberg with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiringstockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;•when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock, certainamendments to our restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval of two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock;•when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock,vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;•when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, ourboard of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors will only be able to be removed fromoffice for cause;•when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, ourstockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;•only our chairman, our chief executive officer, our president, or a majority of our board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting ofstockholders;•advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting ofstockholders;•our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established, and shares of which may beissued, without stockholder approval; and•certain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware.44Table of ContentsItem 1B.Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2.Properties Our corporate headquarters are located in Menlo Park, California. As of December 31, 2020, we owned and leased approximately 10 million square feet ofoffice and building space for our corporate headquarters and in the surrounding areas, and approximately 90 acres of land to be developed to accommodateanticipated future growth.In addition, we have offices in more than 80 cities across North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific. We also own 17data centers globally.We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs.Item 3.Legal ProceedingsBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhereagainst us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection withour platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms andpolicies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the UnitedStates against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for thesecond quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for theNorthern District of California with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25, 2019, thedistrict court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to amend. On November 15, 2019, a second amendedcomplaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. On August 7, 2020, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the second amendedcomplaint, with leave to amend. On October 16, 2020, a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. We believe theselawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse ofcertain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the UnitedStates, Europe, and other jurisdictions. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which was approved bythe federal court and took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantlyenhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. Any other government inquiries regarding these matters could subject us to additionalsubstantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect ourbusiness.On April 1, 2015, a putative class action was filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California by Facebook users allegingthat the "tag suggestions" facial recognition feature violates the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, and seeking statutory damages and injunctive relief. OnApril 16, 2018, the district court certified a class of Illinois residents, and on May 14, 2018, the district court denied both parties' motions for summary judgment.On May 29, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted our petition for review of the class certification order and stayed the proceeding. OnAugust 8, 2019, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the class certification order. On December 2, 2019, we filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review ofthe decision of the Ninth Circuit, which was denied. On January 15, 2020, the parties agreed to a settlement in principle to resolve the lawsuit, which provided for apayment of $550 million by us and was subject to court approval. On or about May 8, 2020, the parties executed a formal settlement agreement, and plaintiffs fileda motion for preliminary approval of the settlement by the district court. On June 4, 2020, the district court denied the plaintiffs' motion without prejudice. On July22, 2020, the parties executed an amended settlement agreement, which, among other terms, provides for a payment of $650 million by us. On August 19, 2020,the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. The settlement is subject to final court approval.45Table of ContentsBeginning on September 28, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against usalleging violations of consumer protection laws and other causes of action in connection with a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook'scode to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Theactions filed in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On November 26, 2019, the district courtcertified a class for injunctive relief purposes, but denied certification of a class for purposes of pursuing damages. On January 16, 2020, the parties agreed to asettlement in principle to resolve the lawsuit. On November 15, 2020, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. The settlement is subject to finalcourt approval. We believe the remaining lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. In addition, the events surrounding this cyber-attackbecame the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) and other government inquiries. Any such inquiries could subject us to substantial fines and costs,require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.From time to time we also notify the IDPC, our designated European privacy regulator under the General Data Protection Regulation, of certain otherpersonal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. For example, inAugust 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from the IDPC that preliminarily concluded that Facebook Ireland's reliance on Standard ContractualClauses in respect of European user data does not achieve compliance with the GDPR and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from theEuropean Union to the United States should therefore be suspended. Facebook Ireland challenged procedural aspects of this IDPC inquiry in a judicial reviewcommenced in the Irish High Court in September 2020, and the court ordered the IDPC not to take further steps in respect of the inquiry until the judicial reviewproceedings conclude (subject to the IDPC's right to apply to vary or lift this order), which we expect to occur in early 2021. For additional information, see Part I,Item 1A, "Risk Factors—Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, content,competition, consumer protection, and other matters" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any such inquiries or investigations could subject us to substantialfines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.In addition, from time to time we are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competitionauthorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices inthe areas of social networking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as past acquisitions. For example, in June2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint against us in theU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 ofthe Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions onaccess to our platform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice andstate attorneys general. On December 9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia filed a complaint against usin the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act byacquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The complaint also alleges that we violated Section 7of the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The lawsuits of the FTC and attorneys general both seek a permanent injunction against our company'salleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. Multiple putative classactions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the United States against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connectionwith these acquisitions and other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. We believe these lawsuits are withoutmerit, and we are vigorously defending them. The result of such litigation, investigations or inquiries could subject us to substantial monetary remedies and costs,interrupt or require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural orbehavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.In addition, from time to time, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory agencies, including inparticular in Brazil and Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including ourobligation to disclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and penalties against us.We believe we46Table of Contentshave multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties.We are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary courseof business, and we may in the future be subject to additional legal proceedings and disputes.Item 4.Mine Safety DisclosuresNot applicable.47Table of ContentsPART IIItem 5.Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesMarket Information for Common StockOur Class A common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol "FB" since May 18, 2012.

We define FCF as net cashprovided by operating activities reduced by net purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases.We believe that FCF is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and provides useful information regarding howcash provided by operating activities compares to the property and equipment investments required to maintain and grow our business.We have chosen our definition for FCF because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors betterunderstand underlying trends in our business. We use FCF in discussions with our senior management and board of directors.FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such asnet cash provided by operating activities. FCF is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses. Some of the limitations ofFCF are:•FCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments; and•other companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.Management compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the FCF measure through disclosure of such limitations, presentation of ourfinancial statements in accordance with GAAP, and reconciliation of FCF to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operatingactivities, as presented below.The following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities:Year Ended December 31,20202019201820172016(in millions)Net cash provided by operating activities$38,747 $36,314 $29,274 $24,216 $16,108 Less: Purchases of property and equipment(15,115)(15,102)(13,915)(6,733)(4,491)Less: Principal payments on finance leases(604)(552)— — — Free cash flow$23,028 $20,660 $15,359 $17,483 $11,617 51Table of ContentsItem 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and therelated notes included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our historicalconsolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual resultscould differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussedbelow and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors." For a discussion of limitations in the measurement ofcertain of our community metrics, see the section entitled "Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Certain revenue information in the section entitled "—Revenue—Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue" is presented on a constant currency basis. Thisinformation is a non-GAAP financial measure. To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we translated revenue for the full year 2020 using 2019 monthlyexchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. This non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolationor as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. This measure may be different from non‑GAAPfinancial measures used by other companies, limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis isprovided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actualeffect on our operating results. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financialperformance of our business, enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, andallows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.Executive Overview of Full Year 2020 ResultsOur key community metrics and financial results for 2020 are as follows:Community growth:•Facebook daily active users (DAUs) were 1.84 billion on average for December 2020, an increase of 11% year-over-year.•Facebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 2.80 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 12% year-over-year.•Family daily active people (DAP) was 2.60 billion on average for December 2020, an increase of 15% year-over-year.•Family monthly active people (MAP) was 3.30 billion as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 14% year-over-year.Financial results:•Revenue was $85.97 billion, up 22% year-over-year, and advertising revenue was $84.17 billion, up 21% year-over-year.•Total costs and expenses were $53.29 billion.•Income from operations was $32.67 billion and operating margin was 38%.•Net income was $29.15 billion with diluted earnings per share of $10.09.•Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $15.72 billion.•Effective tax rate was 12.2%.•Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $61.95 billion as of December 31, 2020.•Headcount was 58,604 as of December 31, 2020, an increase of 30% year-over-year.Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have focused on helping people stay connected, assisting the public health response, and working on theeconomic recovery. We have also continued to invest based on the following company priorities: (i) continue making progress on the major social issues facing theinternet and our company, including privacy, safety, and security; (ii) build new experiences that meaningfully improve people's lives today and set the stage foreven bigger improvements in the future; (iii) keep building our business by supporting the millions of businesses that rely on our52Table of Contentsservices to grow and create jobs; and (iv) communicate more transparently about what we're doing and the role our services play in the world.In 2020, we also continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities: (i) helping marketers use our products to connect with consumers where they areand (ii) making our ads more relevant and effective.Our business has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures to contain ormitigate the outbreak of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on business activity, quarantines, and shelter-in-place orders. These measureshave caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas, both regionally and worldwide, which have significantly impactedour business and results of operations. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, we experienced significant increases in the size and engagement of our active userbase across a number of regions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. More recently, we have seen user growth and engagement returning to pre-pandemictrends, particularly in the United States & Canada region. We are unable to predict the impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty,and we expect these trends to continue to be subject to volatility.The COVID-19 pandemic has also previously caused a reduction in the demand for advertising, as well as a related decline in the pricing of our ads,particularly in the second quarter of 2020. More recently, we believe the pandemic has contributed to an acceleration in the shift of commerce from offline toonline, as well as increasing consumer demand for purchasing products as opposed to services, and we experienced increasing demand for advertising as a result ofthese trends. However, it is possible that this increased demand may not continue in future periods and may even recede as the effects of the pandemic subside,which could adversely affect our advertising revenue growth. The impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement, the demand for and pricing of ouradvertising services, as well as on our overall results of operations, remains highly uncertain for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect that futureadvertising revenue growth will continue to be adversely affected by limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatoryenvironment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers.We intend to continue to invest in our business based on our company priorities, and we anticipate that additional investments in our data center capacity,servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities, as well as scaling our headcount to support our growth, will continue to drive expense growth in 2021. Weexpect 2021 capital expenditures to be in the range of $21-23 billion and total expenses to be in the range of $68-73 billion.53Table of ContentsTrends in Our Facebook User MetricsThe numbers for our key Facebook metrics, our DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), do not include users on Instagram, WhatsApp, or ourother products, unless they would otherwise qualify as DAUs or MAUs, respectively, based on their other activities on Facebook.Trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value of our ads tomarketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active users (asdefined below) access Facebook on mobile devices.•Daily Active Users (DAUs). We define a daily active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through our website or amobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentage ofMAUs, as measures of user engagement on Facebook.DAU/MAU:66%66%66%66%66%66%66%66%66%67%66%66%66% DAU/MAU:77%77%77%76%77%77%77%77%77%77%77%77%76%DAU/MAU:75%75%74%74%74%74%74%74%75%75%74%74%74% DAU/MAU:60%61%61%61%61%61%61%62%62%62%61%62%62%DAU/MAU:64%64%64%64%64%64%64%65%65%65%65%65%65%Note: For purposes of reporting DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU by geographic region, Europe includes all users in Russia and Turkey and Rest of World includes all users in Africa, LatinAmerica, and the Middle East.54Table of ContentsWorldwide DAUs increased 11% to 1.84 billion on average during December 2020 from 1.66 billion during December 2019. Users in India, the Philippines,and Indonesia represented key sources of growth in DAUs during December 2020, relative to the same period in 2019.•Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through our websiteor a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. MAUsare a measure of the size of our global active user community on Facebook.  As of December 31, 2020, we had 2.80 billion MAUs, an increase of 12% from December 31, 2019. Users in India, Indonesia, and the Philippinesrepresented key sources of growth in 2020, relative to the same period in 2019.55Table of ContentsTrends in Our Monetization by Facebook User GeographyWe calculate our revenue by Facebook user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digitalgoods are purchased, or consumer hardware devices are shipped. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by theaverage of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUs usedin this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above. The share of revenue from users who are not alsoFacebook or Messenger MAUs was not material. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users indifferent geographies at different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily dueto the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2020 in the United States & Canada region was more than 11 timeshigher than in the Asia-Pacific region.ARPU:$7.37$6.42$7.05$7.26$8.52$6.95$7.05$7.89$10.14 ARPU:$34.86$30.12$33.27$34.55$41.41$34.18$36.49$39.63$53.56ARPU:$10.98$9.55$10.70$10.68$13.21$10.64$11.03$12.41$16.87 ARPU:$2.96$2.78$3.04$3.24$3.57$3.06$2.99$3.67$4.05ARPU:$2.11$1.89$2.13$2.24$2.48$1.99$1.78$2.22$2.77Note: Our revenue by Facebook user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our Facebook users whenthey perform a revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue isgeographically apportioned based on the billing address of the customer.56Table of ContentsOur annual worldwide ARPU in 2020, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPU during such period, was $32.03, an increase of 10% from 2019. Overthis period, ARPU increased by 18% in the United States & Canada, 15% in Europe, and 9% in Asia‑Pacific, and ARPU was flat in Rest of World. In addition,user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia‑Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will beprimarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to ARPU inany geographic region, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region.57Table of ContentsTrends in Our Family MetricsThe numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users on our other products unless theywould otherwise qualify as MAP or DAP, respectively, based on their other activities on our Family products.Trends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, the value ofour ads to marketers, the volume of Payments transactions, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly activepeople (as defined below) access our Family products on mobile devices.•Daily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp(collectively, our "Family" of products) who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobilebrowser on a given day. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and thereforemust seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of DAP rely upon complex techniques,algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, including bymatching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and countingsuch group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviews of limitedsamples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We view DAP, and DAPas a percentage of MAP, as measures of engagement across our products. For additional information, see the section entitled "Limitations of Key Metricsand Other Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.DAP/MAP:77%78%78%78%78%79%79%79%79%Note: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statisticalvariances and errors. While we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 4% of ourworldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers ofunique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For additional information, see the section entitled"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the second quarter of 2020, we updated our Family metrics calculations to reflect recent datafrom a periodic WhatsApp user survey and to incorporate certain methodology improvements, and we estimate such updates contributed an aggregate of approximately 40 millionDAP to our reported worldwide DAP in June 2020.Worldwide DAP increased 15% to 2.60 billion on average during December 2020 from 2.26 billion during December 2019.58Table of Contents•Monthly Active People (MAP).

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us tomake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis,we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under thecircumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgmentnecessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on ourconsolidated financial statements is material. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with gross vs. net in revenue recognition, valuation ofequity investments, income taxes, loss contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets and their associated estimated usefullives have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates.For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes toconsolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In response to the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with collectibilityassessment of revenue and credit losses of accounts receivable could have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements in future periods, dependingon the duration or degree of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy. Collectibility Assessment of RevenueUnder Topic 606, we recognize revenue using a five-step model. In step one, for a revenue contract to exist, it must be probable that substantially all of theconsideration to which we are entitled to will be collected. In performing such collectibility assessment, we consider various facts and circumstances includingfuture expectations about our customer's ability and intention to pay. Collectibility assessment uses a probable threshold which requires estimation based on severalobjective and subjective factors, such as probability of default, customer’s intention to pay, payment history, financial strength, geography, and industry sub-vertical risks. The collectibility assessment has become uncertain during the current economic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and our actualexperience in the future may differ from our past experiences or current assessment.Credit Losses of Accounts ReceivableOn January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of CreditLosses on Financial Instruments, which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost that an entitydoes not expect to collect over the asset's contractual life, considering past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economicconditions.For accounts receivable measured at amortized cost, we use aging analysis, probability of default methods and incorporate macroeconomic variables that aremost relevant to evaluating and estimating the expected credit losses. These macroeconomic variables may vary by geography, customer-type, or industry sub-vertical. The contractual life of our trade accounts receivable is generally short-term; however, we may experience increasing credit loss risks from accountsreceivable in future periods depending on the duration or degree of economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and our actual experience in thefuture may differ from our past experiences or current assessment.Gross vs. Net in Revenue RecognitionFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third-party publishers, there is significant judgment in evaluating whether we are the principal, andreport revenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods orservices before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretionin61Table of Contentsestablishing price. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact our revenue and cost of revenue recognizedon the consolidated statements of income.Valuation of Equity InvestmentsFor our equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative, determining whether an equity securityissued by the same issuer is similar to the equity security we hold may require judgment in (a) assessment of differences in rights and obligations associated withthe instruments such as voting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion features, and (b) adjustments to the observable price for differences suchas, but not limited to, rights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or most advantageous markets. In addition, the identification of observabletransactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our investee companies, which may occur in a period subsequent to when thetransactions take place. Therefore, our fair value adjustment for these observable transactions may occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction actuallyoccurred. For equity investments, we perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. Thequalitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance;regulatory, economic or technological environment; operational and financing cash flows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. Whenindicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value of our equity investments using the market approach and/or the income approach and recognizeimpairment loss in the consolidated statements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. Estimating fair value requires judgment and useof estimates such as discount rates, forecast cash flows, holding period, and market data of comparable companies, among others.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision forincome taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examinationby the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have beendeveloped based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits arebased on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although webelieve that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final taxoutcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance whenfacts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters isdifferent from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could havea material impact on our financial condition and operating results.Loss ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business.Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with variouslegal and regulatory obligations around the world. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation andenforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. Withrespect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is bothprobable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss andthe loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters andrelated reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact ofnegotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel,62Table of Contentsand updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including when and if theprobability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters.The ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable or if and when the reasonablypossible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess ofmanagement's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomesprobable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. See Note 12—Commitments and Contingencies and Note 15—Income Taxes of the accompanyingnotes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and Part I, Item 3, "Legal Proceedings"of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.Valuation of Long-lived Assets including Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Estimated Useful LivesWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on theirestimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuingcertain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated replacement costs and future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology,acquired patents, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based uponassumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation ofpurchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the usefullife, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from theacquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of themeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fairvalue of our single reporting unit below its carrying value. As of December 31, 2020, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.Long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicatethat the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largelyindependent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the futureundiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property andequipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any significant impairmentcharges during the years presented.The useful lives of our long-lived assets including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are determined by management when thoseassets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. The current estimate of useful lives represents our best estimatebased on current facts and circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as changes to our businessoperations, changes in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, theremaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life. Historically changes inuseful lives have not resulted in material changes to our depreciation and amortization expense.63Table of ContentsComponents of Results of OperationsRevenueAdvertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook,Instagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships withadvertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users.We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considereddelivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketercontracted for. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products.We calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardlessof their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis.Other revenue. Other revenue consists of revenue from the delivery of consumer hardware devices, net fees we receive from developers using ourPayments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.Cost of Revenue and Operating ExpensesCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expensesrelated to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-basedcompensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements,including traffic acquisition and content costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, and cost of consumer hardwaredevices sold.Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits, share-based compensation, and facilities-related costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products.Marketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries and benefits, and share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales,sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions.

Revenue in 2020 increased $15.27 billion, or 22%, compared to 2019. The increase was mostly due to an increase in advertisingrevenue as a result of an increase in the number of ads delivered, partially offset by a decrease in the average price per ad.In 2020, the number of ads delivered increased by 34%, as compared with approximately 33% in 2019. The increase in the ads delivered was driven by anincrease in the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products, and an increase in users. In 2020, the average price per ad decreased by 10%, ascompared with a decrease of approximately 5% in 2019. The decrease in average price per ad during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by adecrease in advertising demand globally during the first two quarters of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and, to a lesser extent, by an increasing proportion ofthe number of ads delivered as Stories ads and in geographies that monetize at lower rates.In the near-term, we anticipate that future advertising revenue growth will be determined primarily by several factors: the extent to which we continue to seeincreasing advertising demand in connection with the shift of commerce from offline to online, as well as increased consumer demand for purchasing products asopposed to services, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; the status of the economic recovery from the slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and themagnitude of fiscal stimulus; and the extent to which changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers result inlimitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools.Advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year. We believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects ourquarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spendingbetween the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our advertising revenue increased 28%, 19%, and 23% between the third and fourth quarters of2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, while advertising revenue for both the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 declined 16% and 10% compared to the fourth quartersof 2019 and 2018, respectively.No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.Foreign Exchange Impact on RevenueThe general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, had anunfavorable impact on revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2020 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billingcurrencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and(1)66Table of Contentsadvertising revenue would have been $86.08 billion and $84.30 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, total revenue and advertising revenue would havebeen $120 million and $129 million, respectively, higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2020. Using the same constant rates,full year 2020 total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $15.39 billion and $14.64 billion, respectively, higher than actual total revenue andadvertising revenue for the full year 2019.Cost of revenueYear Ended December 31,2020201920182020 vs 2019 %Change2019 vs 2018 %Change(dollars in millions)Cost of revenue$16,692 $12,770 $9,355 31 %37%Percentage of revenue19%18%17%2020 Compared to 2019. Cost of revenue in 2020 increased $3.92 billion, or 31%, compared to 2019. The increase was mostly due to an increase inoperational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure, higher cost associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition andcontent costs and, to a lesser extent, an increase in cost of consumer hardware devices sold.In 2021, we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support usergrowth, increased user engagement, and the delivery of new products and services and, to a lesser extent, due to higher costs associated with partner arrangementsand consumer hardware devices.Research and developmentYear Ended December 31,2020201920182020 vs 2019 %Change2019 vs 2018 %Change(dollars in millions)Research and development$18,447 $13,600 $10,273 36 %32 %Percentage of revenue21%19%18% 2020 Compared to 2019. Research and development expenses in 2020 increased $4.85 billion, or 36%, compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due toincreases in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 40% growth in employee headcount from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 in engineering andother technical functions supporting our continued investment in our Family of products and consumer hardware products.In 2021, we plan to continue to hire software engineers and other technical employees, and to increase our investment to support our research anddevelopment initiatives.Marketing and salesYear Ended December 31,2020201920182020 vs 2019 %Change2019 vs 2018 %Change(dollars in millions)Marketing and sales$11,591 $9,876 $7,846 17 %26%Percentage of revenue13%14%14%2020 Compared to 2019. Marketing and sales expenses in 2020 increased $1.72 billion, or 17%, compared to 2019. The increase was primarily driven byincreases in marketing expenses and payroll and benefits expenses, which were partially offset by a decrease in travel-related expenses due to the COVID-19pandemic. Our payroll and benefits expenses increased as a result of a 16% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 in ourmarketing and sales functions.67Table of ContentsIn 2021, we plan to continue the hiring of marketing and sales employees to support our marketing, sales, and partnership efforts, and we anticipatemarketing expenses will increase.General and administrativeYear Ended December 31,2020201920182020 vs 2019 %Change2019 vs 2018 %Change(dollars in millions)Legal accrual related to FTC settlement$— $5,000 $— NMNMOther general and administrative6,564 5,465 3,451 20 %58 %General and administrative$6,564 $10,465 $3,451 (37)%203 %Percentage of revenue8%15%6% 2020 Compared to 2019. Excluding the $5.0 billion FTC settlement accrual recorded in 2019, general and administrative expenses in 2020 increased$1.10 billion, or 20%, compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to higher professional services costs and an increase in payroll and benefits expenses as aresult of a 23% increase in employee headcount from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 in our general and administrative functions.In 2021, we plan to continue to increase general and administrative expenses to support overall company growth.Interest and other income, netYear Ended December 31,2020201920182020 vs 2019 %Change2019 vs 2018 %Change(in millions)Interest income, net$672 $904 $652 (26)%39 %Foreign currency exchange losses, net(129)(105)(213)(23)%51 %Other income (expense), net(34)27 9 NMNMInterest and other income, net$509 $826 $448 (38)%84 % 2020 Compared to 2019. Interest and other income, net in 2020 decreased $317 million compared to 2019. The majority of the decrease was due to adecrease in interest income related to lower interest rates compared to 2019.Provision for income taxesYear Ended December 31,2020201920182020 vs 2019 %Change2019 vs 2018 % Change(dollars in millions)Provision for income taxes$4,034 $6,327 $3,249 (36)%95 %Effective tax rate12.2%25.5%12.8%2020 Compared to 2019. Our provision for income taxes in 2020 decreased $2.29 billion, or 36%, compared to 2019, mostly due to the additional taxexpense incurred in 2019 from the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion and the effects of a tax election to capitalize and amortize certain research and developmentexpenses for U.S. income tax purposes, both discussed below.Our effective tax rate in 2020 decreased compared to 2019, primarily due to the 2019 legal accrual related to the FTC settlement that was not tax-deductible,the additional tax expense incurred in 2019 from the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion, and the effects of a tax election to capitalize and amortize certain research anddevelopment expenses for U.S. income tax purposes.In the third quarter of 2020, as part of finalizing our U.S. income tax return, we elected to capitalize and amortize certain research and developmentexpenses for U.S. income tax purposes. As a result, we recorded a total of $1.07 billion68Table of Contentsincome tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020. The income tax benefit resulted from recording a deferred income tax asset that was greater than thecurrent income tax liability due to different tax rates applicable for the periods in which capitalized expenses will be amortized versus the period in which theincreased current tax liability was accrued. We do not believe this election will materially affect our effective tax rate trend in the future.On July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court issued a decision (Tax Court Decision) in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, which concluded that related partiesin a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share expenses related to share-based compensation. The Tax Court Decision was appealed by the Commissionerto the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit). On June 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion (Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion) that reversed the TaxCourt Decision. Based on the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion, we recorded a cumulative income tax expense of $1.11 billion in the second quarter of 2019. On July22, 2019, the taxpayer requested a rehearing before the full Ninth Circuit and the request was denied on November 12, 2019. The taxpayer requested a hearingbefore the Supreme Court of the United States and the request was denied on June 22, 2020. Since we started to accrue income tax for share-based compensationcost-sharing expense in the second quarter of 2019, the denial of the request by the Supreme Court did not have a material impact to our financial results in 2020.Effective Tax Rate Items. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the following items and income before provision forincome taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign derived intangible income, tax effects from share-based compensation, tax effects of integrating intellectual propertyfrom acquisitions, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the effects of changes in tax law.The accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-basedcompensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock priceremains constant to the January 22, 2021 price, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year of 2021 will be in the high-teens.Integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing ourprovision for income taxes. Consequently, our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition andintegration. The magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relativecontribution to income in subsequent periods.Unrecognized Tax Benefits. As of December 31, 2020, we had net unrecognized tax benefits of $3.48 billion which were accrued as other liabilities. Theseunrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing ofintellectual property, providing services and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties with our research tax credits. The ultimate settlement of the liabilitieswill depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. Based upon the status of litigationdescribed below and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a material change to such amounts within the next 12 months.In July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction withthe examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequentto 2010. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS filed itsPretrial Memorandum in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first sessions ofthe trial began in February 2020, and additional sessions are expected to continue in 2021. The IRS did not provide any information about how it intends to applythe revised adjustment to future years. Based on the information provided, we believe that, if the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in anadditional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $9.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return,plus interest and any penalties asserted.In March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The IRS applied itsposition from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certaintax credits that we claimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up toapproximately $680 million69Table of Contentsin excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the positions of the IRS in the secondNotice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.We have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes, that is lower than the potentialadditional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in the two Notices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positionsrelated to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax that we owe underthe mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). As of December 31, 2020, we have not resolvedthese matters and proceedings continue in the Tax Court.We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes orother tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it isreasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining thatare subject to examination in various jurisdictions, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized taxbenefits. If the taxing authorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse effecton our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.70Table of ContentsQuarterly Results of Operations DataThe following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of income data in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for each of theeight quarters in the period ended December 31, 2020.

Cash and cash equivalentsand marketable securities consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, and investments in U.S. government securities, U.S.government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $61.95 billion as of December 31, 2020, anincrease of $7.10 billion from December 31, 2019. The increase was mostly due to $38.75 billion of cash generated from operations, offset by $15.72 billion forcapital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, $6.36 billion for purchases of equity investments, $6.27 billion for repurchases of our Class Acommon stock, and $3.56 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee restricted stock units (RSU) awards.Cash paid for income taxes was $4.23 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our federal net operating loss carryforwardwas $10.62 billion and our federal tax credit carryforward was $424 million. We anticipate the utilization of a significant portion of these net operating losses andcredits within the next three years.Our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have anexpiration date. As of December 31, 2019, $4.90 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases under this program. In 2020, we repurchased andsubsequently retired 27 million shares of our Class A common stock for $6.30 billion. As of December 31, 2020, $8.60 billion remained available and authorizedfor repurchases. In January 2021, an additional $25 billion of repurchases was authorized under this program.As of December 31, 2020, $7.18 billion of the $61.95 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries.The Tax Act imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminated U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions. As a result,earnings in foreign jurisdictions are available for distribution to the U.S. without incremental U.S. taxes.In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the inquiry of the FTC into our platform and user data practices, which wasapproved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020. We paid the penalty of $5.0 billion in April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified consent order.On April 21, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to invest in Jio Platforms Limited, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited. The transaction closed onJuly 7, 2020, and we paid approximately $5.8 billion at the then-current exchange rate.We currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our sharerepurchase program for the foreseeable future.Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash flow from operating activities during 2020 mostly consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including $6.86 billion of depreciationand amortization and $6.54 billion of share-based compensation expense, and offset by a cash payment of $5.0 billion for the FTC legal settlement. The increase incash flow from operating activities during 2020 compared to 2019 was mostly due to higher net income as adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as depreciationand73Table of Contentsamortization, share-based compensation expense and deferred income tax, partially offset by the payment of $5.0 billion for the FTC legal settlement.Cash flow from operating activities during 2019 primarily consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, including $5.74 billion ofdepreciation and amortization and $4.84 billion of share-based compensation expense. The increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2019 comparedto 2018 was primarily due to higher net income prior to the effect of the $5.0 billion FTC legal settlement accrual, an increase in taxes payable as well as increasesin the non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization, and share-based compensation expense.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities during 2020 mostly resulted from $15.11 billion of purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest in datacenters, servers, office facilities, and network infrastructure, $8.16 billion of net purchases of marketable securities, and $6.36 billion of purchases of equityinvestments. The increase in cash used in investing activities during 2020 compared to 2019 was due to increases in purchases of equity investments and in netpurchases of marketable securities.Cash used in investing activities during 2019 mostly resulted from $15.10 billion of net purchase of property and equipment as we continued to invest indata centers, servers, network infrastructure, and $4.19 billion of net purchases of marketable securities. The increase in cash used in investing activities during2019 compared to 2018 was mostly due to increases in the net purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment.We anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $21 billion to $23 billion in 2021.Cash Used in Financing ActivitiesCash used in financing activities during 2020 mostly consisted of $6.27 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock and $3.56 billion of taxes paidrelated to net share settlement of RSUs. The increase in cash used in financing activities during 2020 compared to 2019 was due to increases in repurchases of ourClass A common stock and in taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs.Cash used in financing activities during 2019 mostly consisted of $4.20 billion used to settle repurchases of our Class A common stock, and $2.34 billion oftaxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $552 million of principal payments on finance leases. The decrease in cash used in financingactivities during 2019 compared to 2018 was mostly due to a decrease in repurchases of our Class A common stock.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on ourfinancial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.74Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsOur principal commitments consist mostly of obligations under operating leases and other contractual commitments. Our obligations under operating leasesinclude among others, certain of our offices, data centers, land, colocations, and equipment. Our other contractual commitments are mostly related to ourinvestments in network infrastructure, consumer hardware, content costs, and data center operations. The following table summarizes our commitments to settlecontractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2020:Payment Due by Period Total20212022-20232024-2025Thereafter(in millions)Operating lease obligations, including imputed interest$20,751 $1,316 $3,017 $3,065 $13,353 Finance lease obligations, including imputed interest1,088 249 214 100 525 Transition tax payable1,543 — 300 1,243 — Other contractual commitments7,504 4,213 1,071 244 1,976 Total contractual obligations$30,886 $5,778 $4,602 $4,652 $15,854 _________________________(1)Includes variable lease payments that were fixed subsequent to lease commencement or modification.Additionally, as part of the normal course of the business, we may also enter into multi-year agreements to purchase renewable energy that do not specify afixed or minimum volume commitment. These agreements are generally entered into in order to secure either volume or price. Using projected market prices orexpected volume consumption, the total estimated spend is approximately $4.94 billion. The ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based onprevailing market prices or actual volume purchased.Our other liabilities also include $3.48 billion related to net uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020. Due to uncertainties in the timing of thecompletion of tax audits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing ofpayments in individual years beyond 12 months. As a result, this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table.ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We record a liability when we believe that it isboth probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we mayincur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to theextent material. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherently unpredictable andsubject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it couldhave a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.See Note 12—Commitments and Contingencies and Note 15—Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II,Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and Part I, Item 3, "Legal Proceedings" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional informationregarding contingencies.Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsFor further information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanyingnotes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.(1)(1)75Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity investment risk, and inflation.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro.Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, have in the past, and may in the future, negatively affect our revenueand other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars.We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing monetaryasset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we havenot entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk. It isdifficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations. Foreign currency losses of $129 million, $105 million, and $213 millionwere recognized in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, as interest and other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income.Interest Rate SensitivityOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities.Our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. governmentsecurities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation ofcapital and supporting our liquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketablesecurities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $794 million and$525 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Any realized gains orlosses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity.Equity Investment RiskOur equity investments are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our holdings. Wecontinually evaluate our equity investments in privately-held companies.Our equity investments are investments in equity securities of privately-held companies without readily determinable market values. We elected to accountfor most of our equity investments using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting fromobservable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. We perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whetherthere are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial condition and businessoutlook; industry and sector performance; economic or technological environment; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. Valuations of ourequity investments are complex due to the lack of readily available market data and observable transactions. Volatility in the global economic climate and financialmarkets, including recent and ongoing effects related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which requires significant judgments, could result in a materialimpairment charge on our equity investments. Equity investments accounted for under the equity method were immaterial as of December 31, 2020 andDecember 31, 2019. Our equity investments had a carrying value of $6.23 billion as of December 31, 2020.For additional information about our equity investments, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 5 — Equity Investments, andNote 6 — Fair Value Measurements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, and "Financial Statements and SupplementaryData" and Part II, Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies andEstimates" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.76Table of ContentsItem 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary DataFACEBOOK, INC.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidatedstatements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and therelated notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all materialrespects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in theperiod ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internalcontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee ofSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated January 27, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Adoption of ASU No. 2016-02As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases in 2019 due to the adoption ofAccounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and the related amendments.Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statementsbased on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordancewith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures toassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Suchprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating theaccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believethat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required tobe communicated to the Audit & Risk Oversight Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on theconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the criticalaudit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.78Table of ContentsLoss ContingenciesDescription of the MatterAs described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is party to various legal proceedings, claims, andregulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. The Company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probableand the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that it will incur a lossin some of these cases, actions or inquiries described above. For certain of these matters, the Company discloses an estimate ofthe amount of loss or range of possible loss that may be incurred. However, for certain other matters, the Company discloses thatthe amount of such losses or a range of possible losses cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.Auditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, loss contingencies related to the various legal proceedings wasespecially challenging due to the significant judgment required to evaluate management's assessments of the likelihood of a loss,and their estimate of the potential amount or range of such losses.How We Addressed the Matterin Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the identification andevaluation of these matters, including controls relating to the Company's assessment of the likelihood that a loss will be realizedand their ability to reasonably estimate the potential range of possible losses.To test the Company's assessment of the probability of incurrence of a loss, whether the loss was reasonably estimable, and theconclusion and disclosure regarding any range of possible losses, including when the Company believes it cannot be reasonablyestimated at this time, we read the minutes or a summary of the meetings of the committees of the board of directors, read theproceedings, claims, and regulatory, or government inquiries and investigations, or summaries as we deemed appropriate,requested and received internal and external legal counsel confirmation letters, met with internal and external legal counsel todiscuss the nature of the various matters, and obtained representations from management. We also evaluated the appropriatenessof the related disclosures included in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.79Table of ContentsUncertain Tax PositionsDescription of the MatterAs discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has received certain notices from the InternalRevenue Service (IRS) related to transfer pricing agreements with the Company's foreign subsidiaries for certain periodsexamined. The IRS has stated that it will also apply its position to tax years subsequent to those examined. If the IRS prevails inits position, it could result in an additional federal tax liability, plus interest and any penalties asserted. The Company usesjudgment to (1) determine whether a tax position's technical merits are more-likely-than-not to be sustained and (2) measure theamount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition.Auditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these uncertain tax positions was especially challenging due to thesignificant judgment required to assess management's evaluation of technical merits and the measurement of the tax positionbased on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.How We Addressed the Matterin Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company'sprocess to assess the technical merits of tax positions related to these transfer pricing agreements and to measure the benefit ofthose tax positions.As part of our audit procedures over the Company's accounting for these positions, we involved our tax professionals to assistwith our assessment of the technical merits of the Company's tax positions. This included assessing the Company'scorrespondence with the relevant tax authorities, evaluating income tax opinions or other third-party advice obtained by theCompany, and requesting and receiving confirmation letters from third-party advisors. We also used our knowledge of, andexperience with, the application of international and local income tax laws by the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate theCompany's accounting for those tax positions. We analyzed the Company's assumptions and data used to determine the amountof the federal tax liability recognized and tested the mathematical accuracy of the underlying data and calculations. We alsoevaluated the appropriateness of the related disclosures included in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in relation tothese matters./s/ Ernst & Young LLPWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2007.Redwood City, CaliforniaJanuary 27, 202180Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Facebook, Inc.Opinion on Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited Facebook, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – IntegratedFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Facebook,Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balancesheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cashflows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and our report dated January 27, 2021 expressed an unqualifiedopinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internalcontrol over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to expressan opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and arerequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of theSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assuranceabout whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluatingthe design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in thecircumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financialreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLPRedwood City, CaliforniaJanuary 27, 202181Table of ContentsFACEBOOK, INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(In millions, except for number

Accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.87Table of ContentsFACEBOOK, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNote 1.Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesOrganization and Description of BusinessFacebook was incorporated in Delaware in July 2004. Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. Wegenerate substantially all of our revenue from advertising.Basis of PresentationWe prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The consolidated financialstatements include the accounts of Facebook, Inc., its subsidiaries where we have controlling financial interests, and any variable interest entities for which we aredeemed to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. None of these reclassifications had a material impact toour consolidated financial statements.Use of EstimatesPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts inthe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets andliabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on various other assumptions thatwe believe are reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not limited to, those relatedto revenue recognition, valuation of equity investments, income taxes, loss contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assetsand their associated estimated useful lives, collectibility of accounts receivable, credit losses of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities, fair value of financialinstruments, and leases. These estimates are based on management's knowledge about current events and expectations about actions we may undertake in thefuture. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.The COVID-19 pandemic has created and may continue to create significant uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions, which may cause further businessslowdowns or shutdowns, depress demand for our advertising business, and adversely impact our results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020,we faced uncertainties around our estimates of revenue collectibility and accounts receivable credit losses. We expect uncertainties around our key accountingestimates to continue to evolve depending on the duration and degree of impact associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Our estimates may change as new eventsoccur and additional information emerges, and such changes are recognized or disclosed in our consolidated financial statements.Revenue RecognitionRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expectto be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.We determine revenue recognition by applying the following steps:•identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;•identification of the performance obligations in the contract;•determination of the transaction price;•allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and•recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.Revenue excludes sales and usage‑based taxes where it has been determined that we are acting as a pass‑through agent.88Table of ContentsAdvertisingAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites or mobile applications.Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered orthe number of actions, such as clicks, taken by our users.We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considereddelivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketercontracted for. In general, we report advertising revenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Ourcontrol is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. For revenue generated from arrangementsthat involve third-party publishers, we evaluate whether we are the principal or the agent, and for those advertising revenue arrangements where we are the agent,we recognize revenue on a net basis.We may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and certain customers may receive cash-based incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate theseamounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenue. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates ofvariable consideration.Other RevenueOther revenue consists of revenue from the delivery of Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) consumer hardware devices, net fees we receive from developers usingour Payments infrastructure, as well as revenue from various other sources.Deferred Revenue and DepositsDeferred revenue mostly consists of billings and payments we receive from marketers in advance of revenue recognition as well as revenue not yetrecognized for unspecified software upgrades and updates for various FRL products. Deposits relate to unused balances held on behalf of our users who primarilyuse these balances to make purchases in games on our platform. Once this balance is utilized by a user, the majority of this amount would then be payable to thedeveloper and the balance would be recognized as revenue. The increase in the deferred revenue balance for the year ended December 31, 2020 was driven by cashpayments from customers in advance of satisfying our performance obligations in FRL sales and advertising revenue, offset by revenue recognized that wasincluded in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period.Our payment terms vary by the products or services offered. The term between billings and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products orservices and customer types, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.Practical Expedients and ExemptionsWe generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded withinmarketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income.We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contractsfor which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.Cost of RevenueOur cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to theoperation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation foremployees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including trafficacquisition89Table of Contentsand content costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, and cost of consumer hardware devices sold.Content CostsOur content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to increase engagement on the platform. Forlicensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted and available for viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. Video content costs thatmeet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.For licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. Expensed content costs are included in cost of revenue on theconsolidated statements of income.Software Development CostsSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed or sold to external users,are expensed before the software or technology reach technological feasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.Software development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and applications used to deliver our services.These software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will becompleted and the software will be used to perform the function intended.Development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision forincome taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.We record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Underthis method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reportingand tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that areexpected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the deferred incometax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment.We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider allavailable evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income andongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examinationby the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have beendeveloped based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits arebased on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although webelieve that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final taxoutcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance whenfacts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters isdifferent from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could havea material impact on our financial condition and operating results.90Table of ContentsAdvertising ExpenseAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on the consolidated statements of income. We incurredadvertising expenses of $2.26 billion, $1.57 billion, and $1.10 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.Cash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted CashCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks and highly liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase.We hold investments in marketable securities, consisting of U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporatedebt securities. We classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale (AFS) investments in our current assets because they represent investments of cashavailable for current operations. Our AFS investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, included in accumulatedother comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. AFS debt securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value are assessed todetermine what amount of that difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities are recognized as a chargein interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income, and any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes, are included inaccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. The amount of credit losses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 was notmaterial. There was no impairment charge for any unrealized losses in 2019 and 2018. We determine realized gains or losses on sale of marketable securities on aspecific identification method and record such gains or losses as interest and other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of income.We also maintain a multi-currency notional cash pool for our participating entities with a third-party bank provider. Actual cash balances are not physicallyconverted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. We classify the overdraft balances within accrued expenses and other current liabilities onthe consolidated balance sheets.We classify certain restricted cash balances within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets based uponthe term of the remaining restrictions.Equity InvestmentsOur equity investments are investments in equity securities of privately-held companies without readily determinable market values. We elected to accountfor most of our equity investments using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting fromobservable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. The change in carrying value, if any, is recognized in interest and other income(expense), net on our consolidated statements of income. We periodically review our equity investments for impairment. If indicators exist and the estimated fairvalue of an investment is below the carrying amount, we will write down the investment to fair value. In addition, we also held equity investments accounted forunder the equity method which were immaterial as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Equity investments had a carrying value of $6.23 billion and $86 million as ofDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There was no material impairment in 2020, 2019 and 2018.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsWe apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value inthe financial statements on a recurring basis. We define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in anorderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which arerequired to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurementsor assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk.Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorizationwithin the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:Level 1- Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.91Table of ContentsLevel 2- Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets orliabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets orliabilities.Level 3- Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing theasset or liability.Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of cash equivalents and marketable debt securities were derived from quoted market prices oralternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs.Accounts Receivable and AllowancesAccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts. We make estimatesof expected credit and collectibility trends for the allowance for credit losses and allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of various factors,including historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of our customers, current economic conditions, reasonable andsupportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. Expected credit losses are recorded asgeneral and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our accounts receivable, net were$11.33 billion and $9.52 billion, respectively, and the allowances of accounts receivable were immaterial.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment, which includes amounts recorded under finance leases, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computedusing the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter.The estimated useful lives of property and equipment are described below:Property and Equipment Useful Life Network equipmentThree to 20 yearsBuildingsThree to 30 yearsComputer software, office equipment and otherTwo to five yearsFinance lease right-of-use assetsThree to 20 yearsLeasehold improvementsLesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term The useful lives of our property and equipment are determined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for theremaining estimated useful lives. Our current estimate of useful lives represents the best estimate of the useful lives based on current facts and circumstances, butmay differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as changes to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, andtechnological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted forprospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life. Historically changes in useful lives have not resulted in material changes to ourdepreciation and amortization expense.Land and assets held within construction in progress are not depreciated. Construction in progress is related to the construction or development of propertyand equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use.The cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciationare removed from their respective accounts, and any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in income from operations.92Table of ContentsLease ObligationsWe have operating leases comprised of certain offices, data center, land, colocations, and equipment leases. We also have finance leases for certain networkequipment. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Most of our leases contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components includefixed payments for maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-lease components and account for them as asingle lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent rent escalations, common area maintenance, insurance, real estatetaxes or other costs. Such variable lease costs are expensed as incurred on the consolidated statements of income. For certain colocation and equipment leases, weapply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities.For leases that have greater than 12-month lease term, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at commencementdate based on the present value of remaining fixed lease payments. We consider only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement.Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. When determining theprobability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based, asset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors.As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date indetermining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating wouldbe in a similar economic environment.Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-current on ourconsolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on ourconsolidated balance sheets.Results and disclosure requirements for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019 are presented under Topic 842, while prior period amounts havenot been adjusted and continue to be reported under Topic 840.Loss ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business.Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with variouslegal and regulatory obligations around the world. The requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation andenforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. Withrespect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probablethat a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss orrange of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that has been previously recorded, and the matters andrelated possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations,settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimatedamount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters.Business CombinationsWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on theirestimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuingcertain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimated replacement costs and future expected cash flows from acquired users,93Table of Contentsacquired technology, acquired patents, and trade names from a market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair valueare based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ fromestimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects Company amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assetsare amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which isnot to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill.Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.Long-lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles AssetsWe evaluate the recoverability of property and equipment and acquired finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events orcircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cashflows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amountsto the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount ofproperty and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value. We have not recorded any significantimpairment charges during the years presented.We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fairvalue of our single reporting unit below its carrying value. As of December 31, 2020, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.Acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We routinely review the remainingestimated useful lives of property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets. If we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remainingunamortized balance is amortized or depreciated over the revised estimated useful life.Foreign CurrencyGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S.dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Translation gains and losses arerecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2020 we had a cumulative translationgain, net of tax of $439 million and as of December 31, 2019, we had a cumulative translation loss, net of tax of $617 million. Net losses resulting from foreignexchange transactions were $129 million, $105 million, and $213 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. These losses wererecorded as interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income.Credit Risk and ConcentrationOur financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketablesecurities, and accounts receivable. The majority of cash equivalents consists of money market funds, that primarily invest in U.S. government and agencysecurities. Marketable securities consist of investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debtsecurities. Our investment portfolio in corporate debt securities is highly liquid and diversified among individual issuers. The amount of credit losses recorded forthe year ended December 31, 2020 was not material.Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different industries and countries. We generated42% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 43% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 from marketers anddevelopers based in the United States, with the majority of revenue outside of the United States coming from customers located in western Europe, China, Canada,Australia, Japan, Vietnam and Brazil.We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. We maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses andbad debt expense on these losses was not material during the years ended94Table of ContentsDecember 31, 2020, 2019, or 2018. In the event that accounts receivable collection cycles deteriorate, our operating results and financial position could beadversely affected.No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.SegmentsOur chief operating decision-maker is our Chief Executive Officer who makes resource allocation decisions and assesses performance based on financialinformation presented on a consolidated basis. There are no segment managers who are held accountable by the chief operating decision-maker, or anyone else, foroperations, operating results, and planning for levels or components below the consolidated unit level. Accordingly, we have determined that we have a singlereportable segment and operating segment structure.Recently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsFair Value MeasurementsOn January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-13, Changes to Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements (Topic820), which improved the effectiveness of disclosure requirements for recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements. The standard removes, modifies, andadds certain disclosure requirements. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.Credit LossesOn January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of CreditLosses on Financial Instruments, using the modified retrospective transition method. Upon adoption, we changed our impairment model to utilize a currentexpected credit losses (CECL) model in place of the incurred loss methodology for financial instruments measured at amortized cost, including our accountsreceivable. In addition, we modified our impairment model for AFS debt securities and to discontinue using the concept of "other than temporary" impairment onAFS debt securities. CECL estimates on accounts receivable are recorded as general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income.Allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities are recognized as a charge in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income.The cumulative effect adjustment from adoption was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. We continue to monitor the financial implications of theCOVID-19 pandemic on expected credit losses.Income TaxesOn October 1, 2020, we early adopted Accounting Standard Update No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes(ASU 2019-12), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes. This guidance was effective beginning January 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. Theadoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet AdoptedIn January 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-01, Investments—Equity Securities(Topic 321), Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) (ASU 2020-01), which clarifies theinteraction of the accounting for equity securities under Topic 321, the accounting for equity method investments in Topic 323, and the accounting for certainforward contracts and purchased options in Topic 815. We will adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2021 and do not expect the adoption of this guidance tohave a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.In August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) andDerivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity(ASU 2020-06), which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by reducing the number of accounting models available for convertible debtinstruments. This guidance also eliminates the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments and requires the use of theif-converted method. This guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2022 on a full95Table of Contentsor modified retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidatedfinancial statements.Note 2.RevenueRevenue disaggregated by revenue source consists of the following (in millions):Year Ended December 31, 202020192018Advertising$84,169 $69,655 $55,013 Other revenue1,796 1,042 825 Total revenue$85,965 $70,697 $55,838 Revenue disaggregated by geography, based on the billing address of our customers, consists of the following (in millions): Year Ended December 31,  202020192018Revenue:   United States and Canada$38,433 $32,206 $25,727 Europe20,349 16,826 13,631 Asia-Pacific19,848 15,406 11,733 Rest of World7,335 6,259 4,747 Total revenue$85,965 $70,697 $55,838 _________________________(1)United States revenue was $36.25 billion, $30.23 billion, and $24.10 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.(2)Europe includes Russia and Turkey, and Rest of World includes Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East.Deferred revenue and deposits consists of the following (in millions):December 31, 20202019Deferred revenue$335 $234 Deposits47 35 Total deferred revenue and deposits$382 $269 Note 3.Earnings per ShareWe compute earnings per share (EPS) of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method required for participating securities. We considerrestricted stock awards to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event of our declaration of adividend for common shares.Undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in determining net income attributable to common stockholders.Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class Bcommon stock outstanding, adjusted for outstanding shares that are subject to repurchase.For the calculation of diluted EPS, net income attributable to common stockholders for basic EPS is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, includingawards under our equity compensation plans. In 2018, the calculation of diluted EPS also included the effect of inducement awards under separate non-planrestricted stock unit (RSU) award agreements.(1)(2)(2)96Table of ContentsIn addition, the computation of the diluted EPS of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of our Class B common stock to Class A common stock,while the diluted EPS of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares to Class A common stock. Diluted EPS attributable to commonstockholders is computed by dividing the resulting net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of fully diluted commonshares outstanding.RSUs with anti-dilutive effect were excluded from the EPS calculation and they were not material for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.Basic and diluted EPS are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights.The numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for our common stock are calculated as follows (in millions, except per shareamounts): Year Ended December 31, 202020192018 Class AClass BClass AClass BClass AClassB Basic EPS:      Numerator      Net income$24,607 $4,539 $15,569 $2,916 $18,411 $3,701 Less: Net income attributable to participating securities— — — — (1)— Net income attributable to common stockholders$24,607 $4,539 $15,569 $2,916 $18,410 $3,701 Denominator      Weighted-average shares outstanding2,407 444 2,404 450 2,406 484 Basic EPS$10.22 $10.22 $6.48 $6.48 $7.65 $7.65 Diluted EPS:    Numerator      Net income attributable to common stockholders$24,607 $4,539 $15,569 $2,916 $18,410 $3,701 Reallocation of net income attributable to participating securities— — — — 1 — Reallocation of net income as a result of conversion of Class B to Class Acommon stock4,539 — 2,916 — 3,701 — Reallocation of net income to Class B common stock— (58)— (18)— (16)Net income for diluted EPS$29,146 $4,481 $18,485 $2,898 $22,112 $3,685 Denominator      Number of shares used for basic EPS computation2,407 444 2,404 450 2,406 484 Conversion of Class B to Class A common stock444 — 450 — 484 — Weighted-average effect of dilutive RSUs and employee stock options37 — 22 1 31 3 Number of shares used for diluted EPS computation2,888 444 2,876 451 2,921 487 Diluted EPS$10.09 $10.09 $6.43 $6.43 $7.57 $7.57 97Table of ContentsNote 4.Cash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesThe following table sets forth the cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities (in millions):December 31,20202019Cash and cash equivalents:Cash$6,488 $4,735 Money market funds9,755 12,787 U.S. government securities1,016 815 U.S. government agency securities— 444 Certificate of deposits and time deposits305 217 Corporate debt securities12 81 Total cash and cash equivalents17,576 19,079 Marketable securities:U.S. government securities20,921 18,679 U.S. government agency securities11,698 6,712 Corporate debt securities11,759 10,385 Total marketable securities44,378 35,776 Total cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities$61,954 $54,855 The gross unrealized gains on our marketable securities were $641 million and $205 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The aggregate absolute value of these Level 3 assets and liabilities was not material to our consolidated financialstatements as of December 31, 2020.On July 7, 2020, we completed our equity investment in Jio and noted observable transactions in similar securities subsequent to the date of our investment.Based on our assessment, we concluded no change in fair value from the initial carrying value of $5.82 billion was required as a result of these observabletransactions. Had there been a change in the fair value, our investment in Jio would be classified within Level 3.

Construction in progress includes costs mostly related to construction of datacenters, network equipment infrastructure to support our data centers around the world, and office buildings.Note 8.LeasesWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, data centers, land, colocations, and equipment. We havealso entered into various non-cancelable finance lease agreements for certain network equipment. Our leases have original lease periods expiring between 2021 and2093. Many leases include one or more options to renew. We do not assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to bereasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.The components of lease costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows (in millions):December 31,20202019Finance lease cost     Amortization of right-of-use assets$259 $195      Interest14 12 Operating lease cost1,391 1,139 Variable lease cost and other, net269 160        Total lease cost$1,933 $1,506 Operating lease expense was $629 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 under Topic 840.100Table of ContentsSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases is as follows:December 31,20202019Weighted-average remaining lease term     Operating leases12.2 years13.0 years     Finance leases14.9 years15.3 yearsWeighted-average discount rate     Operating leases3.1 %3.2 %     Finance leases2.9 %3.1 %The following is a schedule, by years, of maturities of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020 (in millions):Operating LeasesFinance Leases2021$1,300 $68 20221,394 51 20231,266 41 20241,163 41 20251,001 41 Thereafter7,206 401 Total undiscounted cash flows13,330 643 Less: Imputed interest(2,676)(120)Present value of lease liabilities$10,654 $523 Lease liabilities, current$1,023 $54 Lease liabilities, non-current9,631 469 Present value of lease liabilities$10,654 $523 The table above does not include lease payments that were not fixed at commencement or lease modification.

Long-term DebtIn May 2016, we entered into a $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and any amounts outstanding under this facility would be due andpayable on May 20, 2021. No amount had been drawn down under this credit facility, and it was terminated on December 24, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, wehad no outstanding long-term debt.Note 12. Commitments and ContingenciesGuaranteeIn 2018, we established a multi-currency notional cash pool for certain of our entities with a third-party bank provider. Actual cash balances are notphysically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities. As part of the notional cash pool agreement, the bank extends overdraft credit toour participating entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of each day is at least zero. In theunlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool, any overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by Facebook, Inc.Other Contractual CommitmentsWe also have $7.50 billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2020, which are mostly related to our investments in networkinfrastructure, consumer hardware, content costs and data center operations. The majority of these commitments are due within five years.Legal and Related MattersBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhereagainst us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection withour platform and user data practices as well as(1)103Table of Contentsthe misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages andinjunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the United States against us and certain of our directors andofficers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecifieddamages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California with the putativesecurities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. On September 25, 2019, the district court granted our motion to dismiss theconsolidated putative securities class action, with leave to amend. On November 15, 2019, a second amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putativesecurities class action. On August 7, 2020, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint, with leave to amend. On October 16,2020, a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorouslydefending them. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject ofU.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. In July 2019,we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which was approved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020. Amongother matters, our settlement with the FTC required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion which was paid in April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified consentorder.On April 1, 2015, a putative class action was filed against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California by Facebook users allegingthat the "tag suggestions" facial recognition feature violates the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, and seeking statutory damages and injunctive relief. OnApril 16, 2018, the district court certified a class of Illinois residents, and on May 14, 2018, the district court denied both parties' motions for summary judgment.On May 29, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted our petition for review of the class certification order and stayed the proceeding. OnAugust 8, 2019, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the class certification order. On December 2, 2019, we filed a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review ofthe decision of the Ninth Circuit, which was denied. On January 15, 2020, the parties agreed to a settlement in principle to resolve the lawsuit, which provided for apayment of $550 million by us and was subject to court approval. On or about May 8, 2020, the parties executed a formal settlement agreement, and plaintiffs fileda motion for preliminary approval of the settlement by the district court. On June 4, 2020, the district court denied the plaintiffs' motion without prejudice. On July22, 2020, the parties executed an amended settlement agreement, which, among other terms, provides for a payment of $650 million by us. On August 19, 2020,the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. The settlement is subject to final court approval. The settlement amount is reflected in accrued expensesand other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020.Beginning on September 28, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and elsewhere against usalleging violations of consumer protection laws and other causes of action in connection with a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook'scode to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Theactions filed in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On November 26, 2019, the district courtcertified a class for injunctive relief purposes but denied certification of a class for purposes of pursuing damages. On January 16, 2020, the parties agreed to asettlement in principle to resolve the lawsuit. On November 15, 2020, the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement. The settlement is subject to finalcourt approval. We believe the remaining lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. In addition, the events surrounding this cyber-attackbecame the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) and other government inquiries.From time to time we also notify the IDPC, our designated European privacy regulator under the General Data Protection Regulation, of certain otherpersonal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. Although we arevigorously defending our regulatory compliance, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate potential loss related to the inquiries andinvestigations by the IDPC could be material in the aggregate.In addition, from time to time, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory agencies, including inparticular in Brazil and Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, including ourobligation to disclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and penalties against us.We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorously defend such finesand penalties.104Table of ContentsWith respect to the cases, actions, and inquiries described above, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when webelieve a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some ofthese matters. With respect to the matters described above that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible loss, such losses or range ofpossible losses either cannot be estimated or are not individually material, but we believe there is a reasonable possibility that they may be material in theaggregate.We are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary courseof business. For example, from time to time we are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competitionauthorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices inthe areas of social networking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as past acquisitions. For example, in June2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint against us in theU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 ofthe Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions onaccess to our platform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice andstate attorneys general. On December 9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia filed a complaint against usin the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act byacquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The complaint also alleges that we violated Section 7of the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The lawsuits of the FTC and attorneys general both seek a permanent injunction against our company'salleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. Multiple putative classactions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the United States against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connectionwith these acquisitions and other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. We believe these lawsuits are withoutmerit, and we are vigorously defending them.Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world. The requirements for complying with theseobligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligationscould eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these other legal proceedings, claims, regulatory, tax, or government inquiries andinvestigations, and other matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a lossis probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of these othermatters. We believe that the amount of losses or any estimable range of possible losses with respect to these other matters will not, either individually or in theaggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.The ultimate outcome of the legal and related matters described in this section, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, orprobable, or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved againstus for amounts in excess of management's estimates of loss, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in whichany such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.For information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 15—Income Taxes.105Table of ContentsIndemnificationsIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certainmatters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual propertyinfringement or other claims made by third parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of theclaim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain employees, and our certificate of incorporation andbylaws contain similar indemnification obligations.It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnificationclaims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had amaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, as of December 31, 2020, there was not at least a reasonable possibility we had incurred amaterial loss with respect to indemnification of such parties. We have not recorded any liability for costs related to indemnification through December 31, 2020.Note 13. Stockholders' EquityCommon StockOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2020, we are authorizedto issue 5,000 million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141 million shares of Class B common stock, each with a par value of $0.000006 per share. Holdersof our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to dividends when, as and if, declared by our board of directors, subject to the rights of theholders of all classes of stock outstanding having priority rights to dividends. As of December 31, 2020, we have not declared any dividends. The holder of eachshare of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote, while the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes. Shares of our Class Bcommon stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of our Class A common stockupon transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are referred to as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unlessotherwise noted.As of December 31, 2020, there were 2,406 million shares of Class A common stock and 443 million shares of Class B common stock issued andoutstanding.Share Repurchase ProgramOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not have anexpiration date. As of December 31, 2019, $4.90 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases under this program. In January 2020, an additional$10.00 billion of repurchases was authorized under this program. In 2020, we repurchased and subsequently retired 27 million shares of our Class A common stockfor $6.30 billion. As of December 31, 2020, $8.60 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases. In January 2021, an additional $25 billion ofrepurchases was authorized under this program.The timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business andmarket conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be repurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions,including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.Share-based Compensation PlansIn 2020, we maintained one active share-based employee compensation plan, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, which was amended in each of June 2016 andFebruary 2018 (Amended 2012 Plan). Our Amended 2012 Plan provides for the issuance of incentive and nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock awards, stockappreciation rights, RSUs, performance shares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors and consultants. Shares that are withheld in connection with thenet settlement of RSUs or forfeited under our stock plan are added to the reserves of the Amended 2012 Plan. We account for forfeitures as they occur.106Table of ContentsShare-based compensation expense mostly consists of the Company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to employees are measured basedon the grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four years. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized based on thestraight-line basis over the requisite service period.As of December 31, 2020, there were 129 million shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under our Amended 2012 Plan. Pursuantto the automatic increase provision under our Amended 2012 Plan, the number of shares reserved for issuance increases automatically on January 1 of each of thecalendar years during the term of the Amended 2012 Plan, which will continue through April 2026 , by a number of shares of Class A common stock equal to thelesser of (i) 2.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock as of the immediately preceding December 31st or (ii) a number of sharesdetermined by our board of directors. Pursuant to this automatic increase provision, our board of directors approved an increase of 16 million shares reserved forissuance effective January 1, 2021.The following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2020:Number of SharesWeighted-AverageGrant Date Fair Value(in thousands)Unvested at December 31, 201978,851 $165.74 Granted62,032 $188.73 Vested(38,857)$162.27 Forfeited(5,293)$165.72 Unvested at December 31, 202096,733 $181.88 The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $9.38 billion,$6.01 billion, and $7.57 billion, respectively.As of December 31, 2020, there was $16.50 billion of unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to RSUs awards. This unrecognizedcompensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately three years based on vesting under the award serviceconditions.Note 14.

We have federal tax credit carryforwards of $424 million, which will begin to expire in 2029, if not utilized, and statetax credit carryforwards of $2.65 billion, most of which do not expire.Utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitationsprovided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such annual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax creditcarryforwards before their utilization. The events that may cause ownership changes include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock ownership change of greaterthan 50% over a three‑year period.The following table reflects changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions): Year Ended December 31,  202020192018Gross unrecognized tax benefits ‑ beginning of period$7,863 $4,678 $3,870 Increases related to prior year tax positions356 2,309 457 Decreases related to prior year tax positions(253)(525)(396)Increases related to current year tax positions1,045 1,402 831 Decreases related to settlements of prior year tax positions(319)(1)(84)Gross unrecognized tax benefits ‑ end of period$8,692 $7,863 $4,678 109Table of ContentsDuring all years presented, we recognized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on theconsolidated statements of income. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $774 million and $747 million,respectively.If the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits of $8.69 billion as of December 31, 2020 were realized in a future period, this would result in a tax benefitof $4.85 billion within our provision of income taxes at such time.On July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court issued a decision (Tax Court Decision) in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, which concluded that related partiesin a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share expenses related to share-based compensation. The Tax Court Decision was appealed by the Commissionerto the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit). On June 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit issued an opinion (Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion) that reversed the TaxCourt Decision. Based on the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion, we recorded a cumulative income tax expense of $1.11 billion in the second quarter of 2019. On July22, 2019, the taxpayer requested a rehearing before the full Ninth Circuit and the request was denied on November 12, 2019. The taxpayer requested a hearingbefore the Supreme Court of the United States and the request was denied on June 22, 2020. Since we started to accrue income tax for share-based compensationcost-sharing expense in the second quarter of 2019, the denial of the request by the Supreme Court did not have a material impact to our financial results in 2020.We are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject topotential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2014 through 2016 and 2018tax years and by the Irish tax authorities for our 2016 through 2018 tax years. Our 2017 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination by the IRS. Our 2019and subsequent tax years remain open to examination in Ireland.In July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction withthe examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequentto 2010. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS filed itsPretrial Memorandum in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first session ofthe trial began in February 2020 and a second session is expected to continue in 2021. It is not clear how the IRS intends to apply the revised adjustment to futureyears. Based on the information provided, we believe that, if the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of anestimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $9.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penaltiesasserted.In March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The IRS applied itsposition from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certaintax credits that we claimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up toapproximately $680 million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with thepositions of the IRS in the second Notice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.We have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes, that is lower than the potentialadditional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in the two Notices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails in its positionsrelated to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax that we owe underthe mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). As of December 31, 2020, we have not resolvedthese matters and proceedings continue in the Tax Court.We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax itemsthat may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is reasonablypossible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining that are subjectto examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized110Table of Contentstax benefits. If the taxing authorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverseimpact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Note 16.

Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31, 2020,our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we arerequired to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified inthe rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, includingour CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under theExchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in InternalControl—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the assessment,management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020 to provide reasonable assurance regarding thereliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our independent registered public accounting firm,Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Reporton Form 10-K.Changes in Internal ControlThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of theExchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2020 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial ReportingIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controlsand procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, thedesign of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and thatmanagement is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.Item 9B.Other InformationNone.112Table of ContentsPART IIIItem 10.Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate GovernanceThe information required by this item is incorporated by reference to our Proxy Statement for the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be filed with theSEC within 120 days of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.Our board of directors has adopted a Code of Conduct applicable to all officers, directors and employees, which is available on our website(investor.fb.com) under "Corporate Governance."
