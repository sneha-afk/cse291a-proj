Table of ContentsPART IItem 1.BusinessOverviewOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together.All of our products, including our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the metaverse to life. We build technology that helps people connect andshare, find communities, and grow businesses. Our useful and engaging products enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobiledevices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets, and wearables. We also help people discover and learn about what is going on in the world around them,enable people to share their experiences, ideas, photos and videos, and other activities with audiences ranging from their closest family members and friends tothe public at large, and stay connected everywhere by accessing our products. Meta is moving our offerings beyond 2D screens toward immersive experienceslike augmented and virtual reality to help build the metaverse, which we believe is the next evolution in social technology. Our vision for the metaverse doesnot center on any single product, but rather an entire ecosystem of experiences, devices, and new technologies. While the metaverse is in the very early stagesof its development, we believe it will become the next computing platform and the future of social interaction.We report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). Currently, we generate substantially all of our revenue fromselling advertising placements on our family of apps to marketers, which is reflected in FoA. Ads on our platforms enable marketers to reach people across arange of marketing objectives, such as generating leads or driving awareness. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook,Instagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites. RL reflects our efforts to develop the metaverse and generates revenue from sales ofconsumer hardware products, software and content.We invest in our business based on our company priorities, and the majority of our investments are directed toward developing our family of apps. In2022, 82% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and 18% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments were $71.79 billion in 2022 andinclude expenses relating to headcount, data centers and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. We arealso making significant investments in our metaverse efforts, including developing virtual and augmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neuralinterfaces, and other foundational technologies for the metaverse. Our total RL investments were $15.88 billion in 2022 and include expenses relating toheadcount and technology development across these efforts. As these are fundamentally new technologies that we expect will evolve as the metaverseecosystem develops, many products for the metaverse may only be fully realized in the next decade. Although it is inherently difficult to predict when and howthe metaverse ecosystem will develop, we expect our RL segment to continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, and our ability to support ourmetaverse efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-terminitiative. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses,developers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods.Family of Apps Products•Facebook. Facebook helps give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. It's a place for people to share life'smoments and discuss what's happening, nurture and build relationships, discover and connect to interests, and create economic opportunity. Theycan do this through Feed, Reels, Stories, Groups, and more.•Instagram. Instagram brings people closer to the people and things they love. Instagram Feed, Stories, Reels, Video, Live, Shops, and messagingare places where people and creators can connect and express themselves through photos, video, and private messaging, and discover and shopfrom their favorite businesses.•Messenger. Messenger is a simple yet powerful messaging application for people to connect with friends, family, communities, and businessesacross platforms and devices through text, audio and video calls.7Table of Contents•WhatsApp. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable, and secure messaging application that is used by people and businesses around the world tocommunicate and transact in a private way.Reality Labs ProductsMany of our metaverse investments are directed toward long-term, cutting edge research and development for products that are not on the market todayand may only be fully realized in the next decade. This includes exploring new technologies such as neural interfaces using electromyography, which letspeople control their devices using neuromuscular signals, as well as innovations in artificial intelligence (AI) and hardware to help build next-generationinterfaces. In the near term, we are continuing to develop early metaverse experiences through Reality Labs' augmented and virtual reality products that helppeople feel connected, anytime, anywhere. Our current product offerings include Meta Quest virtual reality devices, as well as software and content availablethrough the Meta Quest Store, which enable a range of social experiences that allow people to defy physical distance, including gaming, fitness, entertainment,and more. For example, we have launched Horizon Worlds, a social platform where people can interact with friends, meet new people, play games, and attendvirtual events, and Horizon Workrooms, a virtual reality space for teams to connect and collaborate at work. As part of our virtual reality initiatives, we havealso introduced mixed reality capabilities through our Meta Reality system on Meta Quest Pro, which allows users to experience the immersion and presence ofvirtual reality while still being grounded in the physical world. As part of our augmented reality initiatives, we have introduced Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses,which let people stay more present through hands-free interaction, and Meta Spark, a platform that allows creators and businesses to build augmented realityexperiences that bring the digital and physical worlds together in our apps. In general, while all of these investments are part of our long-term initiative to helpbuild the metaverse, our virtual reality and social platform efforts also include notable shorter-term projects developing specific products and services to go tomarket, whereas our augmented reality efforts are primarily directed toward longer-term research and development projects. For example, in 2023, we expectto spend approximately 50% of our Reality Labs operating expenses on our augmented reality initiatives, approximately 40% on our virtual reality initiatives,and approximately 10% on social platforms and other initiatives. We apply significant judgment in estimating this expense breakdown as there are certainshared costs across product lines, and our expectations are subject to change, including as the metaverse ecosystem and our business strategies evolve. Inparticular, we regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and marketlandscape and our product ideas and designs evolve.CompetitionOur business is characterized by innovation, rapid change, and disruptive technologies. We compete with companies providing connection, sharing,discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/ordevelop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, butnot limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create, share, communicate, and discover content and information online or enable marketers toreach their existing or prospective audiences. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses that useour free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling applications that integrate with our products. Wealso compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual and augmented reality products and services. As we introduce or acquirenew products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and services, including as part of efforts to develop the metaverseor innovate through the application of new technologies such as AI, we may become subject to additional competition.TechnologyOur product development philosophy centers on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are social by design, which means thatour products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the core of the product experience. As our user base grows, as engagement withproducts like video and virtual reality increases, and as we deepen our investment in new technologies, our computing needs continue to expand. We makesignificant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones, as well as for our marketers and developers.We are also investing in protecting the security, privacy, and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen our systemsagainst abuse. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in AI and machine learning, including to recommend relevant unconnectedcontent across our products through our AI-powered discovery engine, to enhance our advertising tools and improve our ad delivery, targeting, andmeasurement capabilities, and8Table of Contentsto develop new product features using generative AI.Sales and OperationsThe majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We also have a global sales force thatis focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to them throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-making to real-time optimizations to post-campaign analytics. We work directly with these advertisers, as well as through advertising agencies and resellers.We operate offices in more than 90 cities around the globe, the majority of which have a sales presence. We also invest in and rely on self-service tools toprovide direct customer support to our users and partners.MarketingHistorically, our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with them, supported by internal efforts tostimulate awareness and interest. In addition, we have invested and will continue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and helpbuild community around the world.Intellectual PropertyTo establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, including know-how, licenseagreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and othercontractual rights. In addition, to further protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from third parties.We do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights. We believe theduration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products.Government RegulationWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, many of which are stillevolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations involve matters includingprivacy, data use, data protection and personal information, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, content, integrity, intellectual property, advertising,marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, artificial intelligence and machine learning,electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights, accessibility, telecommunications, productliability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance,and online payment services. Foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, consumer protection, and other laws and regulations can impose differentobligations, or penalties or fines for non-compliance, or be more restrictive than those in the United States.These U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, areconstantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are oftenuncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction tojurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions or litigation affecting the manner in whichwe display content to our users, moderate content, or obtain consent to various practices, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products,could adversely affect our financial results. In the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court recently agreed to review a matter in which the scope of theprotections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (Section 230) is at issue. In addition, there have been, andcontinue to be, various efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230, and any such changes mayincrease our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect our business and financialresults.We are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receivecertain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products andservices. If we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among ourproducts and services,9Table of Contentsit could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect ourfinancial results. For example, the Privacy Shield, a transfer framework we relied upon for data transferred from the European Union to the United States, wasinvalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, suchas Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. On July 6, 2022, we received a draft decision from the IrishData Protection Commission (IDPC) that preliminarily concluded that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of European Union/EuropeanEconomic Area Facebook user data does not achieve compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and preliminarily proposed that suchtransfers of user data from the European Union to the United States should therefore be suspended. Separately, on March 25, 2022, the European Union andUnited States announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022,President Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities (E.O.), and on December 13, 2022, theEuropean Commission published its draft adequacy decision on the proposed new EU-U.S. DPF. We believe a final decision in this inquiry may issue as earlyas the first quarter of 2023. Although the E.O. is a significant and positive step, if no adequacy decision is adopted by the European Commission and we areunable to continue to rely on SCCs or rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from the European Union to the United States, we will likely beunable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would materially and adverselyaffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments in the past, and proposed or new legislation and regulations couldsignificantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements underthe GDPR, and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our lead EuropeanUnion privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of theregulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacyregulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, theinterpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. Inaddition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements onproducts and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act,and similar laws recently enacted by other states also establish certain transparency rules and create certain data privacy rights for users. In addition, theEuropean Union's ePrivacy Directive and national implementation laws impose additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and includesignificant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments have in the past adverselyaffected, and may in the future adversely affect, our advertising business. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in theEuropean Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areasaffecting our business. For example, the Digital Markets Act (DMA) in the European Union imposes new restrictions and requirements on companies like ours,including in areas such as the combination of data across services, mergers and acquisitions, and product design. The DMA also includes significant penaltiesfor non-compliance, and its key requirements will be enforceable against designated gatekeeper companies in early 2024. We expect the DMA will cause us toincur significant compliance costs and make additional changes to our products or business practices. The requirements under the DMA will likely be subject tofurther interpretation and regulatory engagement. Pending or future proposals to modify competition laws in the United States and other jurisdictions couldhave similar effects. Further, the Digital Services Act (DSA) in the European Union, which will apply to our business as early as June 2023, will impose newrestrictions and requirements for our products and services and may significantly increase our compliance costs. The DSA also includes significant penalties fornon-compliance. In addition, some countries, such as India and Turkey, are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirementsor requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services, cause us tocease the offering of our products and services in certain countries, or result in fines or other penalties. New legislation or regulatory decisions that restrict ourability to collect and use information about minors may also result in limitations on our advertising services or our ability to offer products and services tominors in certain jurisdictions.We are, and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits by governmentauthorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy and data protection, including with respect tominors, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil10Table of Contentsrights, content moderation, and competition. We are also currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees, including themodified consent order we entered into with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which took effect in April 2020 and, among other matters, requires usto maintain a comprehensive privacy program. Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities couldcause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our personnel) or penalties (including substantial monetaryremedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products or userdata practices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us toother structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.For additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form10-K.Human CapitalAt Meta, our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. People are at the heart of every connection weempower, and we are proud of our unique company culture. We strive to build diverse teams across engineering, product design, marketing, and other areas tofurther our mission.As we look forward, we expect the lasting effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic will change how we work and who we reach. We are proud of ourresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic both internally and externally. Employee benefits were robust and established quickly: we implemented 15 days ofsubsidized backup care for child, adult, or eldercare; we paid emergency leave to help address short-term or transitional needs; and we established a temporarystipend to help employees work from home, to name just a few of the benefits.We are committed to fostering an enriching environment for our global workforce, and we are focused on supporting our people in doing the best workof their careers, no matter where they are located. For example:•Location is flexible but presence is essential. As of September 30, 2022, 83% of managers at Meta had direct reports in a different location, and24% of our employees were fully remote.•Remote work has helped us reach new talent in a competitive tech landscape and broaden our representation. We have seen that candidates whoaccepted remote job offers were more often underrepresented people.•Beginning March 2023, we are permitting employees in eligible roles to transfer to any Meta office within their country of employment. We expectdistributed teams to establish strong norms that support efficiency, including more predictable and coordinated in-person working time.At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of online commerce led to accelerated revenue growth. Manypeople predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended. Instead, not only did online commerce return toprior trends, but the more challenging macroeconomic environment and limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools, among other factors,contributed to a decline in our revenue.To address this new environment, we took a number of steps to become a more capital efficient company and, in November 2022, made one of the mostdifficult changes in Meta's history and announced a layoff of approximately 11,000 employees. The cost reduction efforts that we announced, including ourplans to scale back budgets, reduce company perks, shrink our real estate footprint, and restructure teams to increase efficiency alone would not bring ourexpenses in line with our revenue growth and we had to implement the layoff. We made it a priority to treat outgoing employees with respect and announced apackage for U.S. employees that included:•Severance: 16 weeks of base pay plus two additional weeks for every year of service.•Paid time off: payment for all remaining paid time off.11Table of Contents•Restricted stock unit vesting: receipt of November 2022 vesting for outstanding employee restricted stock unit awards.•Health insurance: coverage of the cost of healthcare for employees and their families for six months.•Career services: three months of career support with an external vendor, including early access to unpublished job leads.•Immigration support: dedicated immigration specialists to help guide employees based on their needs.We offered similar support for outgoing employees outside of the United States, taking into account local employment laws.Employee Learning and DevelopmentWe value our investment in growing and keeping a highly skilled and efficient workforce. In addition to permitting employees to seek educationreimbursement, we offer career development opportunities and work experience programs that extend beyond the physical and virtual classroom. To do this, weutilize various learning modalities, such as live virtual and in-person learning experiences, on-demand e-learning, self-service resources, learning communities,and coaching engagements.The Pulse of Our WorkforceEach year, we conduct company-wide employee surveys to help understand how employees feel about working at Meta and what we can do to improvetheir experience. Our surveys help us measure company, manager, and personal experience over time. Further, our more frequent surveys, such as those thathave been administered daily to an ongoing random sample of employees, allows us to measure real-time sentiment around emerging events and companychanges. These surveys are designed to invite feedback and actionable suggestions, inform decisions, and drive change across the company.Health and Well-beingMeta's health and well-being programs are designed to give employees a choice of flexible benefits to help them reach their personal well-being goals.Our programs are tailored to help boost employee physical and mental health, create financial peace of mind, provide support for families, and help employeesbuild a strong community. Programs are designed and funded to support needs like autism care, cancer care, transgender services, holistic well-being, andmental health programs, which represent a few of the ways we support our employees and their dependents.Diversity, Equity and InclusionWe work to build a diverse and inclusive workplace where we can leverage our collective cognitive diversity to build the best products and make thebest decisions for the global community we serve.We offer full-time fully remote positions, including in locations where we do not have offices, which has deepened the diversity of our candidate pool.As published in our Diversity Report in July 2022, we saw that providing remote optionality increased the diversity of the overall composition of ourworkforce: U.S candidates who accepted remote job offers were substantially more likely to be Black, Hispanic, Native American, Alaskan Native, PacificIslander, veterans and/or people with disabilities, and globally, candidates who accepted remote job offers were more likely to be women.As part of our 2022 Diversity Report, we published our global gender diversity and U.S. ethnic diversity workforce data. As of June 30, 2022, our globalemployee base was comprised of 37.1% females and 62.9% males, and our U.S. employee base was comprised of the following ethnicities: 46.5% Asian,37.6% White, 6.7% Hispanic, 4.9% Black, 4.0% two or more ethnicities, and 0.3% additional groups (including American Indian or Alaska Native and NativeHawaiian or Other Pacific Islander).We want our products to work for the world and we need to grow and keep the best talent in order to do that. To aid in this effort, we have taken steps toreduce bias from our hiring processes and performance management systems.12Table of ContentsWe have also invested in learning opportunities to identify and reduce inherent bias through Diversity, Equity and Inclusion trainings for our employeesand enhanced learning and development courses. In addition, we offer career development programs to employees, including opportunities for women leadersat Meta to connect, support and grow together and programs to help ensure that we develop leaders of color, build a more diverse leadership pipeline and fostera culture of sponsorship through leader advocacy.Compensation and BenefitsWe offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best people, and we help care for our people so they can focus on our mission. Ouremployees' total compensation package includes market-competitive salary, bonuses or sales incentives, and equity. We generally offer full-time employeesequity at the time of hire and through annual equity grants because we want them to be owners of the company and committed to our long-term success. Wehave conducted pay equity analyses for many years, and continue to be committed to pay equity. In 2022, we announced that our analyses indicate that wecontinue to have pay equity across genders globally and race in the United States for people in similar jobs, accounting for factors such as location, role, andlevel.Through Life@ Meta, our holistic approach to benefits, we provide our employees and their dependents with resources to help them thrive. We offer awide range of benefits across areas such as health, family, finance, community, and time away, including healthcare and wellness benefits, family buildingbenefits, family care resources, retirement savings plans, access to tax and legal services, and Meta Resource Groups to build community at Meta.Corporate InformationWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004.

You should consider carefully the risks anduncertainties described below, in addition to other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statementsand related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or thatwe currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occurs, ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of ourClass A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.Summary Risk FactorsOur business is subject to a number of risks, including risks that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives or may adversely affect ourbusiness, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects. These risks are discussed more fully below and include, but are not limited to,risks related to:Risks Related to Our Product Offerings•our ability to add and retain users and maintain levels of user engagement with our products;•the loss of, or reduction in spending by, our marketers;•reduced availability of data signals used by our ad targeting and measurement tools;•ineffective operation with mobile operating systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners;•failure of our new products, or changes to our existing products, to attract or retain users or generate revenue;Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results•our ability to compete effectively;•fluctuations in our financial results;•unfavorable media coverage and other risks affecting our ability to maintain and enhance our brands;•the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on our advertising business;•acquisitions and our ability to successfully integrate our acquisitions;•our ability to build, maintain, and scale our technical infrastructure, and risks associated with disruptions in our service;•operating our business in multiple countries around the world;•litigation, including class action lawsuits;Risks Related to Government Regulation and Enforcement•government restrictions on access to Facebook or our other products, or other actions that impair our ability to sell advertising, in their countries;•complex and evolving U.S. and foreign privacy, data use and data protection, content, competition, consumer protection, and other laws andregulations;14Table of Contents•the impact of government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, including litigation and investigations by privacy and competitionauthorities;•our ability to comply with regulatory and legislative privacy requirements, including our consent order with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC);Risks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual Property•the occurrence of security breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, and other cyber incidents or undesirable activity on ourplatform;•our ability to obtain, maintain, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights; andRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock•limitations on the ability of holders of our Class A Common Stock to influence corporate matters due to the dual class structure of our common stockand the control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock by our founder, Chairman, and CEO.Risks Related to Our Product OfferingsIf we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products, our revenue, financial results, andbusiness may be significantly harmed.The size of our user base and our users' level of engagement across our products are critical to our success. Our financial performance has been and willcontinue to be significantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and engaging active users of our products that deliver ad impressions, particularlyfor Facebook and Instagram. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one ormore markets from time to time, particularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates. User growth and engagement are also impacted by anumber of other factors, including competitive products and services, such as TikTok, that have reduced some users' engagement with our products andservices, as well as global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increases anddecreases in the size and engagement of our active user base from period to period at different points during the pandemic, and may continue to have a variedimpact on the size and engagement of our active user base in the future. In addition, in connection with the war in Ukraine, access to Facebook and Instagramwas restricted in Russia and these services were then prohibited by the Russian government, which contributed to slight declines on a quarter-over-quarter basisin the number of DAUs and MAUs on Facebook in Europe in the first quarter and the second quarter of 2022, as well as a slight decline on a quarter-over-quarter basis in the total number of MAUs on Facebook in the second quarter of 2022. Any future declines in the size of our active user base may adverselyimpact our ability to deliver ad impressions and, in turn, our financial performance.If people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain orincrease the frequency and duration of their engagement. A number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen theiractive user bases or levels of engagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our activeuser base or engagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user engagement can be difficult to measure, particularly as weintroduce new and different products and services. Any number of factors can negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement, including if:•users increasingly engage with other competitive products or services;•we fail to introduce new features, products, or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products or services, or make changes toexisting products and services, that are not favorably received;•users feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the frequency, prominence, format, size, and qualityof ads that we display;15Table of Contents•users have difficulty installing, updating, or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of actions by us or third parties that we relyon to distribute our products and deliver our services;•user behavior on any of our products changes, including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared on our products and services;•we are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with a variety of mobile operating systems andnetworks, and that achieve a high level of market acceptance;•there are decreases in user sentiment due to questions about the quality or usefulness of our products or our user data practices, concerns about thenature of content made available on our products, or concerns related to privacy, safety, security, well-being, or other factors;•we are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is appropriate, interesting, useful, and relevant tothem;•we are unable to obtain or attract engaging third-party content;•we are unable to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that integrate with our products;•users adopt new

how we promote different products and services across our familyof products;16Table of Contents•initiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement, including the use of new technologies such as artificial intelligence, are unsuccessful ordiscontinued, whether as a result of actions by us, our competitors, or other third parties, or otherwise;•third-party initiatives that may enable greater use of our products, including low-cost or discounted data plans, are scaled back or discontinued, or thepricing of data plans otherwise increases;•there is decreased engagement with our products as a result of taxes imposed on the use of social media or other mobile applications in certaincountries, internet shutdowns, or other actions by governments that affect the accessibility of our products in their countries (for example, beginning inthe first quarter of 2022, our user growth and engagement were adversely affected by the war in Ukraine and service restrictions imposed by theRussian government);•we fail to provide adequate customer service to users, marketers, developers, or other partners;•we, developers whose products are integrated with our products, or other

products, such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable developers to build, grow, andmonetize applications, reduce user activity on our products by making it easier for our users to interact and share on third-party applications.From time to time, certain of these factors have negatively affected user retention, growth, and engagement to varying degrees. If we are unable tomaintain or increase our user base and user engagement, particularly for our significant revenue-generating products like Facebook and Instagram, our revenueand financial results may be adversely affected. Any significant decrease in user retention, growth, or engagement could render our products less attractive tousers, marketers, and developers, which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our ability to deliver ad impressions and, accordingly, our revenue,business, financial condition, and results of operations. As the size of our active user base fluctuates in one or more markets from time to time, we will becomeincreasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to grow revenue.We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. The loss of marketers, or reduction in spending by marketers, could seriously harm ourbusiness.Substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from marketers advertising on Facebook and Instagram. As is common in the industry, ourmarketers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. Many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertisingbudget with us. Marketers will not continue to do business with us, or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us, if we do not deliver ads inan effective manner, if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives, or if theyare not satisfied for any other reason. We have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changesreduce our ability to effectively target ads, which has to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. If weare unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment, the demand for our ads may not increase, or may decline, in which case our revenue andfinancial results may be harmed.Our advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors, including:•decreases in user engagement, including time spent on our products;•our inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products;•product changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size, format, frequency, or relative prominence of ads displayed onour products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our products;17Table of Contents•our inability to maintain or increase marketer demand, the pricing of our ads, or both;•our inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users;•changes to the content or application of third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising,including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;•adverse litigation, government actions, or legislative, regulatory, or other legal developments relating to advertising, including developments that mayimpact our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising;•user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize, such as our feed and Stories products,including as a result of increased usage of our Reels or other video or messaging products;•reductions of advertising by marketers due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that protect the security and integrity of ourplatform;•the availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of ourads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;•loss of advertising market share to our competitors, including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if competitors offer lower priced, moreintegrated, or otherwise more effective products;•limitations on our ability to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe as a result ofEuropean regulators, courts, or legislative bodies determining that our reliance on SCCs or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data fromthe European Union to the United States is invalid;•changes in our marketing and sales or other operations that we are required to or elect to make as a result of risks related to complying with foreignlaws or regulatory requirements or other government actions;•decisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of announcements by us or adverse media reports or other negative publicity involvingus, our user data practices, our advertising metrics or tools, content on our products, our interpretation, implementation, or enforcement of policiesrelating to content on our products (including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent Oversight Board), developers withapplications that are integrated with our products, or other companies in our industry;•reductions of advertising by marketers due to objectionable content made available on our products by third parties, questions about our user datapractices or the security of our platform, concerns about brand safety or potential legal liability, or uncertainty regarding their own legal andcompliance obligations;•the effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users opt in or out of the use of data for ads, including as a result of product changes andcontrols that we have implemented or may implement in the future in connection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, California Privacy Rights Act(CPRA), the Digital Markets Act (DMA), other laws, regulations, regulatory actions, or litigation, or otherwise, that impact our ability to use data foradvertising purposes;•the degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they engage with our ads;•changes in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced;•the success of technologies designed to block the display of ads or ad measurement tools;•changes in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base; and18Table of Contents•the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, whether in the advertising industry in general, or among specific types of marketers orwithin particular geographies (for example, the war in Ukraine and service restrictions imposed by the Russian government have adversely affectedour advertising business in Europe and other regions).From time to time, certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees. The occurrence of any of these or otherfactors in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our ads, which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads, or cause marketers to stopadvertising with us altogether, either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results.Our ad targeting and measurement tools incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control, as well as signalsgenerated within our products, and changes to the regulatory environment, third-party mobile operating systems and browsers, and our own products haveimpacted, and we expect will continue to impact, the availability of such signals, which will adversely affect our advertising revenue.Our ad targeting and measurement tools rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control, as well as signalsgenerated within our products, in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users, and any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affectour business. For example, legislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), asamended by the CPRA, have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In particular, we have seenincreases in the number of users opting to control certain types of ad targeting in Europe following product changes implemented in connection with our GDPRand ePrivacy Directive compliance, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in California following adoption of theCCPA. Regulatory guidance, decisions, or new legislation in these or other jurisdictions, such as the DMA, may require us to make additional changes to ourproducts in the future that further reduce our ability to use these signals, which has occurred in the past. For example, we expect to implement additionalchanges in response to the December 2022 decision by the IDPC regarding the legal basis for our delivery of behavioral advertising in Europe.In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced futureplans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Applemade certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers'ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketersare willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give usersthe ability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services, including changes implemented inconnection with the GDPR and other regulatory frameworks.These developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and negatively impacted our advertisingrevenue. For example, our advertising revenue has been negatively impacted by marketer reaction to targeting and measurement challenges associated with iOSchanges beginning in 2021. If we are unable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in the future, our targeting and measurement capabilitieswill be materially and adversely affected, which would in turn significantly impact our advertising revenue.Our user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies,products, and standards that we do not control.The substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continueto feature our products, or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperabilityof our products with popular mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, such as the Android and iOSoperating systems and mobile browsers. Changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or changes in our relationships with mobile operating systempartners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or mobile carriers, or in the content or application of their terms of service or policies (which they havemade in the past and continue to seek to implement) that degrade our products' functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products,give preferential treatment to competitive products, limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads, or charge fees related to thedistribution of our products or our delivery of ads have in the past adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect,19Table of Contentsthe usage of our products and monetization on mobile devices. For example, Apple previously released an update to its Safari browser that limits the use ofthird-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to our users and impacts monetization, and also released changes to iOS thatlimit our ability to target and measure ads effectively, while expanding their own advertising business. We expect that any similar changes to its, Google's, orother browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads and impact monetization. Additionally, in order todeliver high quality mobile products, it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies, products, systems, networks, andstandards that we do not control, and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, and browser developers. We may not besuccessful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively withthese technologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. In the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use our products on their mobiledevices, or if our users choose not to access or use our products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to our products, our usergrowth and user engagement could be harmed. From time to time, we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of ourbusiness based on what we believe to be in our long-term best interests. Such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators ofmobile operating systems, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, browser developers, other business partners, or advertisers, and there is no assurance thatthese actions will result in the anticipated long-term benefits. In the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with suchthird parties deteriorate, our user growth, engagement, and monetization could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed. We have in the pastexperienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, and any suchoccurrences in the future may negatively impact our user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices, which may in turn materially andadversely affect our business and financial results.Our new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits, or otherwise adversely affect ourbusiness.Our ability to retain, increase, and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existingproducts and to create successful new products, both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties. We may introduce significantchanges to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little or no priordevelopment or operating experience. For example, we do not have significant experience with consumer hardware products or virtual or augmented realitytechnology, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and technologies. We continue to incur substantial costs,and we may not be successful in generating profits, in connection with these efforts. We are also making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI)initiatives, including to recommend relevant unconnected content across our products, enhance our advertising tools, and develop new product features usinggenerative AI. These efforts, including the introduction of new products or changes to existing products, may result in new or enhanced governmental orregulatory scrutiny, litigation, ethical concerns, or other complications that could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. We have alsoinvested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in growing our messaging products to support increasing usage of such products. We havehistorically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion, and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits frommessaging over the long term. In addition, we are moving forward with plans to implement end-to-end encryption across our messaging services, as well asfacilitate cross-app communication between these platforms, which are subject to governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions. If our newproducts or changes to existing products fail to engage users, marketers, or developers, or if our business plans are unsuccessful, we may fail to attract or retainusers or to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business may be adversely affected.We make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.We frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistentwith our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, we haveimplemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our user data practices. Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, whichhas to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, our Off-Facebook Activity tool enablesusers to place limits on our storage and use of information about their interactions with advertisers' apps and websites, which reduces our ability to deliver themost relevant and effective ads to our users. Similarly, from time to time we update our feed display and ranking algorithms or other product features tooptimize the user experience, and these changes have had, and20Table of Contentsmay in the future have, the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with our products, which could adversely affect our financialresults. From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, wehave made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers,and developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products. We also may introduce new features or other changes to existingproducts, or introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, or use cases where we have more proven means ofmonetization, such as our feed products. In addition, as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products, from time to time theseefforts have reduced, and may in the future reduce, engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetizeless successfully or that are not growing as quickly. For example, we plan to continue to promote Reels, which we do not currently monetize at the same rate asour feed or Stories products. These decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that weexpect.We may not be successful in our metaverse strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.We believe the metaverse, an embodied internet where people have immersive experiences beyond two-dimensional screens, is the next evolution insocial technology. In 2021, we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life. We expect this will be acomplex, evolving, and long-term initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in infrastructure as wellas privacy, safety, and security efforts, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners, and other participants. However, the metaverse may notdevelop in accordance with our expectations, and market acceptance of features, products, or services we build for the metaverse is uncertain. We regularlyevaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and market landscape and our product ideasand designs evolve. In addition, we have limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual and augmented reality technology, which may enableother companies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including if we are unable todevelop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate effectively with metaverse technologies, products, systems,networks, or standards. Our metaverse efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to continue tomake significant investments in virtual and augmented reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and our ability to support these efforts isdependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In addition, as our metaverse efforts evolve, we may be subject to a variety ofexisting or new laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy, safety, competition, contentregulation, consumer protection, and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs,require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other factors, our metaverse strategy and investmentsmay not be successful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands, our ability to expand our base of users, marketers, and developers may be impaired, and ourbusiness and financial results may be harmed.We believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands iscritical to expanding our base of users, marketers, and developers. Many of our new users are referred by existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brandswill depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which we may not do successfully. We mayintroduce new products or terms of service or policies that users do not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions of our developersor advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using third-party applications integrated with our products or interacting withparties that advertise through our products. We will also continue to experience media, legislative, or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regardinguser privacy, data use, encryption, content, product design, algorithms, advertising, competition, and other issues, including actions or decisions in connectionwith elections, the COVID-19 pandemic, or geopolitical events, which has in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our reputationand brands. For example, beginning in September 2021, we became the subject of media, legislative, and regulatory scrutiny as a result of a former employee'sallegations and release of internal company documents relating to, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcementpractices, as well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. In addition, in March 2018, we announceddevelopments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in21Table of Contentsviolation of our terms and policies. We also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of objectionable content on our services orobjectionable practices by advertisers or developers, or to otherwise enforce our policies or address user concerns, which has occurred in the past and whichcould erode confidence in our brands. Our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to otherusers, by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to bemisleading (or intended to manipulate opinions), by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for security-relatedpurposes or to censor certain content on our platform, by the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends, including, for example, any suchactions around the pandemic, geopolitical events, or elections in the United States and around the world, by decisions or recommendations regarding content onour platform from the independent Oversight Board, by research or media reports concerning the perceived or actual impacts of our products or services onuser well-being, or by our decisions regarding whether to remove content or suspend participation on our platform by persons who violate our communitystandards or terms of service. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not besuccessful. Certain of our actions, such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concerns around our handling of political speech andadvertising, hate speech, and other content, as well as user well-being issues, have eroded confidence in our brands and may continue to do so in the future. Ifwe fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and financial results may be adverselyaffected.We may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that integrate with our products.We have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build, grow, and monetize applications that integrate with our products.Such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building, growing, or monetizing applications that create and maintain user engagement.Additionally, developers may choose to build on other platforms, including platforms controlled by third parties, rather than building products that integratewith our products. We are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience,and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developers. For example, from time to time, we have taken actionsto reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on our products with the objective of enhancing the user experience, and such actionshave reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and our monetization opportunities from, applications integrated with our products. In addition, as partof our efforts related to privacy, safety, and security, we conduct investigations and audits of platform applications from time to time, and we also haveannounced several product changes that restrict developer access to certain user data. In some instances, these actions, as well as other actions to enforce ourpolicies applicable to developers, have adversely affected, or will adversely affect, our relationships with developers. If we are not successful in our efforts tomaintain or grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with our products or if we are unable to continue to build and maintaingood relations with such developers, our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected.Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial ResultsOur business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.We compete with companies providing connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as companiesthat sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We facesignificant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create, share, communicate,and discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences. We compete to attract, engage, and retainpeople who use our products, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers whobuild compelling applications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual andaugmented reality products and services. As we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce newproducts and services, including as part of efforts to develop the metaverse or innovate through the application of new technologies such as artificialintelligence, we may become subject to additional competition.22Table of ContentsSome of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources, experience, or stronger competitive positions in certain product segments,geographic regions, or user demographics than we do. For example, some of our competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political,legal, and regulatory regimes that enable them to compete more effectively than us. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively thanus to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions. We believe that some users, particularly younger users, are aware of and activelyengaging with other products and services similar to, or as a substitute for, our products and services, and we believe that some users have reduced their use ofand engagement with our products and services in favor of these other products and services. In the event that users increasingly engage with other productsand services, we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly, in which case our business would likely beharmed.Our competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reachingand successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Some competitors may gain a competitiveadvantage against us in areas where we operate, including: by making acquisitions; by limiting our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads;by imposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads; by making access to our products more difficult or impossible; by making it more difficult tocommunicate with our users; or by integrating competing platforms, applications, or features into products they control such as mobile device operatingsystems, search engines, browsers, or e-commerce platforms. For example, each of Apple and Google have integrated competitive products with iOS andAndroid, respectively. In addition, Apple has released changes to iOS that limit our ability, and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry, to targetand measure ads effectively. As a result, our competitors may, and in some cases will, acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at theexpense of our own efforts, which would negatively affect our business and financial results. In addition, from time to time, we may take actions in response tocompetitive threats, but we cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results.We believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:•the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our competitors' products;•the size and composition of our user base;•the engagement of users with our products and competing products;•our ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services;•the timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors' products;•our safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their data;•our ability to distribute our products to new and existing users;•our ability to monetize our products;•the frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;•customer service and support efforts;•marketing and selling efforts, including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide marketers with a compelling return on theirinvestments;•our ability to establish and maintain developers' interest in building applications that integrate with our products;•our ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with our products;23Table of Contents•changes mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us;•acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors;•our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers, designers, and product managers;•our ability to cost-effectively manage and grow our operations; and•our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors.If we are not able to compete effectively, our user base, level of user engagement, and ability to deliver ad impressions may decrease, we may becomeless attractive to developers and marketers, and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.Our financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict.Our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future. Additionally, we have a limited operating history with thecurrent scale of our business, which makes it difficult to forecast our future results. As a result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results asindicators of future performance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets.Our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control,including:•our ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement, particularly for our products that deliver ad impressions;•our ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period;•our ability to recognize revenue or collect payments from marketers in a particular period;•fluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality, such as historically strong spending in the fourth quarter of each year, episodic regionalor global events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors;•the frequency, prominence, size, format, and quality of ads shown to users;•the success of technologies designed to block the display of ads;•changes to the content or application of third-party policies that limit our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of advertising,including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as Apple and Google;•the pricing of our ads and other products;•the diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on Facebook and Instagram;•our ability to generate revenue from Payments, or the sale of our consumer hardware products or other products we may introduce in the future;•changes to existing products or services or the development and introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors;•user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize;24Table of Contents•increases in marketing, sales, and other operating

program;25Table of Contents•fluctuations in the market values of our investments in marketable securities, in the valuation of our non-marketable equity securities, and in interestrates;•the incurrence of indebtedness or our ability to refinance existing indebtedness on acceptable terms;•changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and•changes in regional or global business, macroeconomic, or geopolitical conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which mayimpact the other factors described above.Unfavorable media coverage negatively affects our business from time to time.We receive a high degree of media coverage around the world. Unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our privacy practices, advertising policies,product decisions, product quality, litigation or regulatory activity, government surveillance, the actions of our advertisers, the actions of our developers whoseproducts are integrated with our products, the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends, the substance or enforcement of our communitystandards, terms of service, or other policies, the actions of our users, the quality and integrity of content shared on our platform, the perceived or actualimpacts of our products or services on user well-being, or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to ours, has in the past, and could in thefuture, adversely affect our reputation. For example, we have been the subject of significant media coverage involving concerns around our handling ofpolitical speech and advertising, hate speech, and other content, as well as user well-being issues, and we continue to receive negative publicity related to thesetopics. Beginning in September 2021, we became the subject of significant media coverage as a result of allegations and the release of internal companydocuments by a former employee. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be, subject to negative publicity in connection with our handling ofmisinformation and other illicit or objectionable use of our products or services, including in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical events,and elections in the United States and around the world. Any such negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and loyalty of ouruser base and marketer demand for advertising on our products, which could result in decreased revenue and adversely affect our business and financial results,and we have experienced such adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.The COVID-19 pandemic has previously had, and may in the future have, a significant adverse impact on our advertising revenue and also exposes ourbusiness to other risks.We are subject to public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has previously significantly impacted, and may in the future impact, ourbusiness and results of operations. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures from time totime to contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on business activity, quarantines, and shelter-in-placeorders, which have previously caused, and may in the future cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in certain affected countries and regions. Thesedevelopments led to volatility in the demand for and pricing of our advertising services at various points throughout the pandemic, and we may experiencesimilar effects in the future. In addition to the impact on our advertising business, the pandemic exposes our business, operations, and workforce to a variety ofother risks, including:•volatility in the size of our user base and user engagement, particularly for our messaging products, whether as a result of shelter-in-place measures orother factors;•delays in product development or releases, or reductions in manufacturing production and sales of consumer hardware, as a result of inventoryshortages, supply chain or labor shortages;•increased misuse of our products and services or user data by third parties, including improper advertising practices or other activity inconsistent withour terms, contracts, or policies, misinformation or other illicit or objectionable material on our platforms, election interference, or other undesirableactivity; •significant volatility and disruption of global financial markets, which could cause fluctuations in currency exchange rates or negatively impact ourability to access capital in the future;•illnesses to key employees, or a significant portion of our workforce, which may result in inefficiencies, delays, and disruptions in our business; and26Table of Contents•increased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates used in our financial statements.Any of these developments may adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, or result in legal or regulatory actions against us.Our costs are continuing to grow, and some of our investments, particularly our investments in virtual and augmented reality, have the effect of reducingour operating margin and profitability. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be harmed.Operating our business is costly, and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base, as users increase theamount and types of content they consume and the data they share with us, for example with respect to video, as we develop and implement new products, aswe market new and existing products and promote our brands, as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure, as we continue to invest in new andunproven technologies, including artificial intelligence and machine learning, and as we continue our efforts to focus on privacy, safety, security, and contentreview. We have recently undertaken cost reduction measures in light of a more challenging operating environment, which may adversely affect these or otherbusiness initiatives, and some of these measures have involved, and may in the future involve, up-front charges and outlays of cash to reduce certain longer-term expenses. In addition, from time to time we are subject to settlements, judgments, fines, or other monetary penalties in connection with legal andregulatory developments that may be material to our business. We are also continuing to increase our investments in new platforms and technologies, includingas part of our efforts related to building the metaverse. Some of these investments, particularly our significant investments in virtual and augmented reality,have generated only limited revenue and reduced our operating margin and profitability, and we expect the adverse financial impact of such investments tocontinue for the foreseeable future. For example, our investments in Reality Labs reduced our 2022 overall operating profit by approximately $13.72 billion,and we expect our investments to increase in the future. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance will beharmed.We plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions, which could impact our financial condition or results of operations andmay adversely affect the price of our common stock.As part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementarycompanies, products, or technologies, and from time to time may enter into other strategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures. We may not beable to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions on favorable terms, or at all,including as a result of regulatory challenges. For example, in 2022, the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority directed us to divest our Giphyacquisition. In addition, in 2022, the FTC filed lawsuits against us to enjoin our proposed acquisition of Within Unlimited. In some cases, the costs of suchacquisitions or other strategic transactions may be substantial, and there is no assurance that we will realize expected synergies and potential monetizationopportunities for our acquisitions or a favorable return on investment for our strategic investments.We may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions or other strategic transactions, which has occurred in the past and couldadversely affect our liquidity. The incurrence of indebtedness also results in increased fixed obligations and increased interest expense, and could also includecovenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and weregularly grant RSUs to retain the employees of acquired companies, which could increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial results, and result indilution to our stockholders. In addition, any acquisitions or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by users, marketers,developers, or investors, which may adversely affect our business or the price of our Class A common stock.We may also discover liabilities, deficiencies, or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance,which may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligenceare dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives, aswell as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition orother strategic transaction, including tax and accounting charges. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions27Table of Contentsmay also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finite-lived intangible assets on ourbalance sheet upon closing. Any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.We may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire.The integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or thatdevelop products where we do not have prior experience, and we may not manage these processes successfully. We continue to make substantial investments ofresources to support our acquisitions, which has in the past resulted, and we expect will in the future result, in significant ongoing operating expenses and thediversion of resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We cannot assure you that these investments will be successful. If we fail tosuccessfully integrate the companies we acquire, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.Our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption in our service could damage ourreputation, result in a potential loss of users and engagement, and adversely affect our financial results.Our reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technicalinfrastructure. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, interruptions in the availability or performance of our products from time totime. Our systems may not be adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delays or outagesthat could be harmful to our business. If our products are unavailable when users attempt to access them, or if they do not load as quickly as expected, usersmay not use our products as often in the future, or at all, and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted, any of which could adversely affect our business andfinancial performance. We have experienced such issues to varying degrees from time to time. For example, in October 2021, a combination of an error and abug resulted in an approximately six-hour outage of our services. In addition, as the amount and types of information shared on our products continue to growand evolve, as the usage patterns of our global community continue to evolve, and as our internal operational demands continue to grow, we will need anincreasing amount of technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to continue to satisfy our needs. It is possible that we may failto continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands, which may adversely affect our userengagement and advertising revenue. In addition, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures resulting from earthquakes, adverse weatherconditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism, geopolitical conflict, other physical security threats, cyber-attacks, or other catastrophic events. Globalclimate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Any such events may result in usersbeing subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart orprovide our services, which may adversely affect our financial results. We also have been, and may in the future be, subject to increased energy and/or othercosts to maintain the availability or performance of our products in connection with any such events.A substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties. Any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providerscould harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers facemay adversely affect our business, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services theyprovide. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, supply and labor shortages and otherdisruptions in logistics and the supply chain for our technical infrastructure. As a result, we have had to make certain changes to our procurement practices, andin the future we may not be able to procure sufficient components, equipment, or services from third parties to satisfy our needs, or we may be required toprocure such components, equipment, or services on unfavorable terms.Any of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products, require unfavorable changes to existingproducts, delay the introduction of future products, or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.28Table of ContentsWe could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure.We have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products, and we plan tocontinue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers, subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems, and other projects.The infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations around the world, including in emerging markets thatexpose us to increased risks relating to anti-corruption compliance and political challenges, among others. We have in the past suspended, and may in the futuresuspend, certain of these projects as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors. Additional unanticipated delays or disruptions in the completion ofthese projects, including due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portions of such projects, or availability of components, challenges in obtainingrequired government or regulatory approvals, or other geopolitical challenges or actions by governments, whether as a result of the pandemic, trade disputes, orotherwise, may lead to increased project costs, operational inefficiencies, interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality or reliability of ourproducts, or impairment of assets on our balance sheet. In addition, there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testingphases of design and implementation, which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment, that could furtherdegrade the user experience or increase our costs. Further, much of our technical infrastructure is located outside the United States, and action by a foreigngovernment, or our response to such government action, has resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in the impairment of a portion of our technicalinfrastructure, which may interrupt the delivery or degrade the quality or reliability of our products and lead to a negative user experience or increase our costs.Any of these events could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.Real or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.The numbers for our key metrics, which include our Family metrics (DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP)) and Facebook metrics(DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU)), are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts. While these numbersare based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuringusage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these metrics require significantjudgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, andsuch estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology. We regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and fromtime to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics.Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for suchadjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the errormargins disclosed below.In addition, our Family metrics and Facebook metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology.Many people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individualproduct. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would notreflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook,Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, andtherefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complextechniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple useraccounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group ofaccounts as one person. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently aresubject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data, which itself issubject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will beapproximately 3% of our worldwide MAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people,and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates,29Table of Contentspotentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that donot match actual changes or trends.To calculate our estimates of Family DAP and MAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviewsof limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating theseestimates. For example, to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information,IP addresses, and user names. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, whichare inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the future contribute, to changes in ourreported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase therisk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products, and we rely on more limiteddata signals for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products, we have fewer data signals fromWhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts on our other products.Similarly, although Messenger Kids users are included in our Family metrics, we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applicationsfor purposes of calculating DAP and MAP. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of ourown product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stabilityor accuracy of our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as ourmethodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user surveys,algorithms, or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population ofour users. In addition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).We regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of "violating" accounts. We define "violating"accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of2022, we estimated that approximately 3% of our worldwide MAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of alimited sample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look for account information and behaviorsassociated with Facebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity dueto encryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accountsestimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, makeproduct changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP and MAP estimates in aparticular period. We intend to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our MAP consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis. Violatingaccounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates.We also regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics to estimate the number of "duplicate" and "false" accounts among our MAUs. A duplicate account isone that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account. We divide "false" accounts into two categories: (1) user-misclassified accounts, where usershave created personal profiles for a business, organization, or non-human entity such as a pet (such entities are permitted on Facebook using a Page rather thana personal profile under our terms of service); and (2) violating accounts, which represent user profiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes thatviolate our terms of service, such as bots and spam. The estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample ofaccounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical IPaddresses and similar user names, and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to thereviewers. Any loss of access to data signals we use in this process, whether as a result of our own product decisions, actions by third-party browser or mobileplatforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and false accounts.Our estimates also may change as our methodologies evolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies or product changes that mayallow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users. Duplicate andfalse accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from ourestimates.30Table of ContentsIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11% of our worldwide MAUs. We believe thepercentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as the Philippines and Vietnam, as compared to more developed markets.In the fourth quarter of 2022, we estimated that false accounts may have represented approximately 4-5% of our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation of falseaccounts can vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts, which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries such asIndonesia, Nigeria, and Vietnam. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make product changes, or take other actions to reduce the number ofduplicate or false accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAU and MAU estimates in a particular period. We intend to disclose our estimates ofthe number of duplicate and false accounts among our MAUs on an annual basis.Other data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while user-provided data indicates a decline inusage among younger users, this age data may be unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age.Accordingly, our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete.In addition, our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors, such as the user's IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user's actual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing Facebook fromthe location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user's actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are alsosusceptible to algorithm or other technical errors, and our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors.In addition, from time to time we provide, or rely on, certain other metrics and estimates, including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of ourads. Many of our metrics involve the use of estimations and judgments, and our metrics and estimates are subject to software bugs, inconsistencies in oursystems, and human error. Such metrics and estimates also change from time to time due to improvements or changes in our terminology or methodology,including as a result of loss of access to data signals we use in calculating such metrics and estimates. We have in the past been, and may in the future be,subject to litigation as well as marketer, regulatory, and other inquiries regarding the accuracy of such metrics and estimates. Where marketers, developers, orinvestors do not perceive our metrics or estimates to be accurate, or where we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics or estimates, we may be subject toliability, our reputation may be harmed, and marketers and developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to our products that deliver adimpressions, which could negatively affect our business and financial results.We cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our scale.Our employee headcount and the scale and complexity of our business have increased significantly over time. The scale of our business and breadth ofour products create significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources, including managing multiple relationships with users,marketers, developers, and other third parties, and maintaining information technology systems and internal controls and procedures that support the scale andcomplexity of our business. In addition, some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation, soour management may not be able to manage our scale effectively. To effectively manage our scale, we must maintain, and continue to adapt, our operational,financial, and management processes and systems, manage our headcount and facilities, and effectively train and manage our personnel. Many of our personnelwork remotely, which may lead to challenges in productivity and collaboration. In addition, from time to time, we implement organizational changes to pursuegreater efficiency and realign our business and strategic priorities. For example, in 2022, we announced a layoff of approximately 11,000 employees andinitiated several measures to scale down our office facilities. As our organization continues to evolve, and we are required to implement and adapt complexorganizational management structures, we may find it difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture, including our ability to quickly develop andlaunch new and innovative products. This could negatively affect our business performance.We have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have more limited operating experience, andthis may subject us to increased business, economic, and legal risks that could affect our financial results.We have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business operations and the translation of ourproducts. We currently make Facebook available in more than 100 different languages,31Table of Contentsand we have offices or data centers in approximately 40 different countries. We may enter new international markets where we have limited or no experience inmarketing, selling, and deploying our products. Our products are generally available globally, but some or all of our products or functionality may not beavailable in certain markets due to legal and regulatory complexities. For example, several of our products are not generally available in China. We alsooutsource certain operational functions to third parties globally. If we fail to deploy, manage, or oversee our international operations successfully, our businessmay suffer. In addition, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:•political, social, or economic instability;•risks related to legal, regulatory, and other government scrutiny applicable to U.S. companies with sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions,including with respect to privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, trade compliance, supply chain, competition, consumer protection, intellectualproperty, environmental, health and safety, licensing, and infrastructure matters;•potential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or requirements to provide userinformation to local authorities;•enhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards across different languages and countries;•fluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls;•foreign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the UnitedStates or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely, and impede our ability to invest such cash efficiently;•higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;•enhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions;•burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, including laws related to taxation, content removal, content moderation, data localization, dataprotection, e-commerce and payments, and regulatory oversight;•reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;•difficulties in staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated withmultiple international locations, including difficulties arising from personnel working remotely;•compliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences; and•geopolitical events affecting us, our marketers or our industry, including trade disputes, armed conflicts, and pandemics.In addition, we must manage the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices in any given jurisdiction and our obligations to complywith laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws or regulations applicable to us, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. BriberyAct 2010. We also must manage our obligations to comply with laws and regulations related to import and export controls, trade restrictions, and sanctions,including regulations established by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control. Government agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminalpenalties they may seek to impose against companies for violations of anti-corruption laws or regulations, import and export controls, trade restrictions,sanctions, and other laws, rules, and regulations.If we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our financial results could be adverselyaffected. We also may be required to or elect to cease or modify our operations or the offering of our products and services in certain regions, including as aresult of the risks described above, which could adversely affect our business, user growth and engagement, and financial results.32Table of ContentsWe face design, manufacturing, and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could adversely impact our financial results.We face a number of risks related to design, manufacturing, and supply chain management with respect to our consumer hardware products. Forexample, the consumer hardware products we sell from time to time have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from the design ormanufacture of the products, or from the software used in the products. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from othermanufacturers or suppliers. Our brand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues, other failures to meet our customers'expectations, or findings of our consumer hardware products to be defective.We rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer hardware products, which subjects us to anumber of risks that have been exacerbated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, supply or laborshortages or other disruptions in logistics and the supply chain, which could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations, productdevelopment, and sales. We could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonableterms, or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties, manufacturing or supply constraints, or other reasons), ormake adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of such arrangements with them. The manufacturing, distribution, and sale of our consumerhardware products also may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions, geopolitical challenges, trade disputes, or other actions by governments thatsubject us to supply shortages, increased costs, or supply chain or logistics disruptions.We also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and certain company policies regardingsourcing practices and standards on labor, trade compliance, health and safety, the environment, and business ethics, but we do not control them or theirpractices and standards. If any of them violates laws, fails to implement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws, or implements practices or standardsregarded as unethical, corrupt, or non-compliant, we could experience supply chain disruptions, government action or fines, canceled orders, or damage to ourreputation.We face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products.We are exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in product cycles and pricing, unsafe ordefective merchandise, supply chain disruptions, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to ourconsumer hardware products, and other factors. The demand for our products can also change significantly between the time inventory or components areordered and the date of sale. While we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking consumer hardware products wemay sell, from time to time we have experienced difficulties in accurately predicting and meeting the consumer demand for our products. In addition, when webegin selling or manufacturing a new consumer hardware product or enter new international markets, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships,determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components mayrequire significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. Any one of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our operating results.We are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming, and, if resolved adversely, couldharm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.We are involved in numerous lawsuits, including stockholder derivative lawsuits and putative class action lawsuits, many of which claim statutorydamages and/or seek significant changes to our business operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future.Because of the scale of our user, advertiser, and developer base, the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damageseven if the alleged per-user or entity harm is small or non-existent. In addition, we have faced, currently face, and will continue to face additional class actionand other lawsuits based on claims related to advertising, antitrust, privacy, security, biometrics, content, algorithms, user well-being, employment, activities onour platform, consumer protection, or product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer hardware and software, including virtual realitytechnology and products, which are new and unproven. For example, we are currently the subject of multiple putative class action suits in connection with ourplatform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in33Table of Contentsviolation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, as wellas other alleged anticompetitive conduct; a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents beginning in September 2021; thedisclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021; and allegations that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience size for advertisements,resulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. We are also the subject of multiple lawsuits related to our alleged recommendation of and/or failureto remove harmful content. The results of any such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and any negative outcome from any such lawsuitscould result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or undesirable changes to our products or business practices, and accordingly our business,financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.There can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose asignificant burden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not bereversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which hasoccurred in the past and which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations.We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.Our tax obligations, including income and non-income taxes, are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements,including the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage, protect, and use our intellectual property, and the valuations of ourintercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretationand certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as Meta. We aresubject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken,including our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit couldincrease our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results ofoperations, and cash flows. For example, in 2016 and 2018, the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries inconjunction with the examination of the 2010 through 2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS's position and are litigating this issue, the ultimateresolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, may adversely affect our financial results.The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there aremany transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate ourbusiness, and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our provision forincome taxes and estimates of our non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement may differ from the amounts recorded in our financialstatements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.Our future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit split, changes in the amount and recognitionof deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles.Changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The tax regimes we are subject to or operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may be subject to significant change.Changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or changes in interpretations of existing laws, could materially affect our financial position, results of operations, and cashflows. For example, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax ratefor the fourth quarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the Tax Act, or other executive or Congressional actionsin the United States or globally could materially increase our tax obligations and significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issuedor such actions take effect, and in future periods. In addition, many countries have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or haveenacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which weoperate our business.34Table of ContentsOver the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit ShiftingProject that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countriesin which we do business. In 2021, more than 140 countries tentatively signed on to a framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15%, among otherprovisions. As this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country, the timing and ultimate impact of any suchchanges on our tax obligations are uncertain. Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals that would apply to variousaspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax, as well asproposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, several jurisdictions haveproposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services, which include business activities on digital advertising and online marketplaces, and which apply toour business.The European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation providespreferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and concluded that certain member states, including Ireland, have provided illegal stateaid in certain cases. These investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations.Due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities describedabove could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position,results of operations, and cash flows. Such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amountsestimated and recorded in our financial statements.Given our levels of share-based compensation, our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price.The tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from period to period. In periods in whichour stock price varies from the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, we will recognize excess tax benefits or shortfalls that willimpact our effective tax rate. For example, in 2022, tax shortfalls recognized from share-based compensation increased our provision for income taxes by$471 million and our effective tax rate by two percentage points as compared to the tax rate without such shortfalls. In future periods in which our stock pricevaries in comparison to the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that period, our effective tax rate may be inversely impacted. The amountand value of share-based compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share-basedcompensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effects are dependent on our stock price, which we do not control, and a decline in our stock price couldsignificantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results.If our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.We review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, such as adecline in stock price and market capitalization. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually. If such goodwill or intangibleassets are deemed to be impaired, an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would berecognized. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill orintangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect our results of operations.The loss of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business.We currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg. Although we have entered into anemployment agreement with Mr. Zuckerberg, the agreement has no specific duration and constitutes at-will employment. In addition, many of our keytechnologies and systems are custom-made for our business by our personnel. The loss of key personnel, including members of management as well as keyengineering, product development, marketing, and sales personnel, could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business.35Table of ContentsIn addition, we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position. In particular, weexpect to continue to face significant challenges in hiring technical personnel, particularly for engineering talent, whether as a result of competition with othercompanies or other factors. As we continue to mature, the incentives to attract, retain, and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by futurearrangements may not be as effective as in the past, and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees or to retain our existing employees, wewould incur substantial additional share-based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted. Our ability toattract, retain, and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility. In addition, restrictive immigration policies or legal orregulatory developments relating to immigration may negatively affect our efforts to attract and hire new personnel as well as retain our existing personnel. Ifwe do not succeed in attracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, or retaining and motivating existing personnel, we may be unable to groweffectively.Our CEO has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock.Mark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstandingcapital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directorsand any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control,merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result inthe consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor fromacquiring our Class A common stock, which has limited voting power relative to the Class B common stock, and might harm the trading price of our Class Acommon stock. In addition, Mr. Zuckerberg has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of hisposition as our CEO and his ability to control the election or, in some cases, the replacement of our directors. In the event of his death, the shares of our capitalstock that Mr. Zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated. As a board member and officer, Mr. Zuckerberg owes afiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As astockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares, and shares over which he has voting control as governed by a votingagreement, in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.We cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. Share repurchasescould also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves.Although our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date, the program does not obligate us torepurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of our Class A common stock. We cannot guarantee that the program will befully consummated or that it will enhance long-term stockholder value. The program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility, and anyannouncement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock. In addition, this program will diminish our cashreserves.Risks Related to Government Regulation and EnforcementActions by governments that restrict access to Facebook or our other products in their countries, censor or moderate content on our products in theircountries, or otherwise impair our ability to sell advertising in their countries, could substantially harm our business and financial results.Governments from time to time seek to censor or moderate content available on Facebook or our other products in their country, restrict access to ourproducts from their country partially or entirely, or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extendedperiod of time or indefinitely. For example, user access to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part inChina, Iran, and North Korea. In addition, government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be inviolation of their laws or a threat to public safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries fromtime to time. For example, in 2020, Hong Kong adopted a National Security Law that provides authorities with the ability to obtain information, remove andblock access to content, and suspend36Table of Contentsuser services, and if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted. In addition, if we are required to or elect to makechanges to our marketing and sales or other operations in Hong Kong as a result of the National Security Law or other legislation, our revenue and business inthe region will be adversely affected. In addition, in connection with the war in Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022, access to Facebook and Instagram wasrestricted in Russia and the services were then prohibited by the Russian government, which has adversely affected, and will likely continue to adversely affect,our revenue and business in the region. It is also possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising, including incountries where access to our consumer-facing products may be blocked or restricted. For example, we generate meaningful revenue from a limited number ofresellers serving advertisers based in China, and it is possible that the Chinese government could take action that reduces or eliminates our China-basedadvertising revenue, whether as a result of the trade dispute with the United States, in response to content issues or information requests in Hong Kong orelsewhere, or for other reasons, or take other action against us, such as imposing taxes or other penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results.Similarly, if we are found to be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for social media companies in Turkey, the Turkish government could takeaction to reduce or eliminate our Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise adversely impact access to our products. In the event that content shown onFacebook or our other products is subject to censorship, access to our products is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, we are required to orelect to make changes to our operations, or other restrictions are imposed on our products, or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographicmarkets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our ability to retain or increase ouruser base, user engagement, or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue asanticipated, and our financial results could be adversely affected.Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use and data protection, content,competition, safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, and other matters. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertaininterpretation, and could result in claims, changes to our products and business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations, or declines inuser growth or engagement, or otherwise harm our business.We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including privacy, datause, data protection and personal information, biometrics, encryption, rights of publicity, content, integrity, intellectual property, advertising, marketing,distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage, data disclosure, artificial intelligence and machine learning, electroniccontracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights, accessibility, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political law compliance, securities law compliance, and onlinepayment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions that we may take may subject us toadditional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, consumer protection, and otherlaws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States.These U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, areconstantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are oftenuncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from jurisdiction tojurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions or litigation affecting the manner in whichwe display content to our users, moderate content, or obtain consent to various practices could adversely affect user growth and engagement. Such actionscould affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results.We are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process and/or receivecertain data that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products andservices. For example, in 2016, the European Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to theUnited States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition,the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicialscrutiny. For example, the CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States following achallenge brought by the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, our continued reliance on37Table of ContentsSCCs will be the subject of future regulatory consideration. In particular, in August 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from the IDPC thatpreliminarily concluded that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of European Union/European Economic Area Facebook user data does notachieve compliance with the GDPR and preliminarily proposed that such transfers should therefore be suspended. In February 2022, we received a revisedpreliminary draft decision in which the IDPC maintained its preliminary conclusion that these transfers should be suspended. The IDPC's draft decision wasthen further refined and shared on July 6, 2022 with other European data protection regulators (CSAs) as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism.Separately, on March 25, 2022, the European Union and United States announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. DataPrivacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States SignalsIntelligence Activities (E.O.), and on December 13, 2022, the European Commission published its draft adequacy decision on the proposed new EU-U.S. DPF.On January 19, 2023, the IDPC referred the inquiry to a vote by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), pursuant to the dispute resolution process underArticle 65 GDPR, in respect of elements of the draft decision over which consensus could not be reached between concerned supervisory authorities. Webelieve a final decision in this inquiry may issue as early as the first quarter of 2023. Although the E.O. is a significant and positive step, if no adequacydecision is adopted by the European Commission and we are unable to continue to rely on SCCs or rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from theEuropean Union to the United States, we will likely be unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook andInstagram, in Europe, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, we have beenmanaging investigations and lawsuits in Europe, India, and other jurisdictions regarding the 2016 and 2021 updates to WhatsApp's terms of service and privacypolicy and its sharing of certain data with other Meta products and services, including a lawsuit currently pending before the Supreme Court of India. If we areunable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products andservices, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adverselyaffect our financial results.We have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments in the past, and proposed or new legislation and regulations couldsignificantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements underthe European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission ofpersonal data breach notifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with thenotification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving and draft decisions in investigations bythe IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes inthe final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties fornon-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protectionregulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The California ConsumerPrivacy Act (CCPA), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), also establishes certain transparency rules and create new data privacy rightsfor users, including limitations on our use of certain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to control the purposes for which their data isshared with third parties. Other states have proposed or enacted similar comprehensive privacy laws that afford users with similar data privacy rights andcontrols. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertising services, or reductions of advertisingby marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, state regulators in Californiaand Colorado are considering adopting regulations that could further limit how companies can use personal information for advertising purposes. In Europe,regulators continue to issue guidance concerning the ePrivacy Directive's requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies, and may imposespecific measures in the future which could directly impact our use of such technologies. In addition, the ePrivacy Directive and national implementation lawsimpose additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products orbusiness practices as a result of these or similar developments have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our advertisingbusiness. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and statelevel, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. For example, the DMA in the EuropeanUnion imposes new restrictions and requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of data across services, mergers andacquisitions, and product design. The DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and its key requirements will be enforceable againstdesignated gatekeeper companies in early 2024. We expect the DMA will cause us to incur significant compliance costs and make additional changes to ourproducts or business practices. The requirements under the DMA will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement. Pending or futureproposals to38Table of Contentsmodify competition laws in the United States and other jurisdictions could have similar effects. Further, the Digital Services Act (DSA) in the European Union,which will apply to our business as early as June 2023, will impose new restrictions and requirements for our products and services and may significantlyincrease our compliance costs. The DSA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, some countries, such as India and Turkey, areconsidering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements thatcould increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services, cause us to cease the offering of our products and services in certain countries, or result infines or other penalties. New legislation or regulatory decisions that restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors may also result inlimitations on our advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions.These laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any other government actions, have in the past led to, andmay in the future lead to, unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs, loss of revenue, delays or impediments in the development of newproducts, negative publicity and reputational harm, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm ourbusiness, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.We have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and we expect to continue to be subject tosuch proceedings and other inquiries in the future, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in amanner materially adverse to our business.We receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations, many ofwhich are evolving and subject to interpretation. We are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests forinformation, actions, and audits in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy and data protection, including withrespect to minors, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content moderation, and competition. In addition, we are currently, and may in the futurebe, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees. For example, data protection, competition, and consumer protection authorities in the European Union andother jurisdictions have initiated actions, investigations, or administrative orders seeking to restrict the ways in which we collect and use information, orimpose sanctions, and other authorities may do the same. In addition, beginning in March 2018, we became subject to FTC, state attorneys general, and othergovernment inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse ofcertain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement andmodified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which was approved by the federal court and took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlementwith the FTC required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. Thestate attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing. We also notify the IDPC, our lead European Unionprivacy regulator under the GDPR, and other regulators of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries andinvestigations by the IDPC and other regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. We have in the past been, and may in the future be,subject to fines and requirements to changes to our business practices as a result of such inquiries and investigations. In addition, we are subject to a lawsuit bythe state of Texas in connection with the “tag suggestions” and other facial recognition features on our products.We are also subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition authorities in the United States, Europe, andother jurisdictions, which relate to many aspects of our business, including with respect to users and advertisers, as well as our industry. Such inquiries,investigations, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, digital advertising,and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrustinvestigation of our company. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust inquiries and investigations by the U.S.Department of Justice and state attorneys general. Beginning in December 2020, we also became subject to lawsuits by the FTC and the attorneys general from46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District of Columbia in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we violated antitrust laws,including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform, among other things. The complaintsof the FTC and attorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief,including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. In addition, in December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement ofObjections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules. We are alsosubject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices. For example,39Table of Contentsbeginning in September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to allegations and the release of internal companydocuments by a former employee.Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, exposeus to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our personnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to changeour business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products or user data practices), result in negative publicity andreputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies thatadversely affect our business, and we have experienced some of these adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.Compliance with our FTC consent order, the GDPR, the CPRA, the ePrivacy Directive, the DMA, the DSA, and other regulatory and legislative privacyrequirements require significant operational resources and modifications to our business practices, and any compliance failures may have a materialadverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.We are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with our modified consent order with the FTC,requirements of the GDPR, and other current and anticipated regulatory and legislative requirements around the world, such as the CPRA, ePrivacy Directive,DMA, and DSA. In particular, we are maintaining a comprehensive privacy program in connection with the FTC consent order that includes substantialmanagement and board of directors oversight, stringent operational requirements and reporting obligations, prohibitions against making misrepresentationsrelating to user data, a process to regularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to the FTC, and regular assessments of our privacy program by anindependent third-party assessor, which has been and will continue to be challenging and costly to maintain and enhance. These compliance and oversightefforts are increasing demand on our systems and resources, and require significant new and ongoing investments, including investments in complianceprocesses, personnel, and technical infrastructure. We are reallocating resources internally to assist with these efforts, and this has had, and will continue tohave, an adverse impact on our other business initiatives. In addition, these efforts require substantial modifications to our business practices and make somepractices such as product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming, and costly. As a result, we believe our ability to develop and launch newfeatures, products, and services in a timely manner has been and will continue to be adversely affected. We also expect that our privacy compliance andoversight efforts will require significant time and attention from our management and board of directors. The requirements of the FTC consent order and otherprivacy-related laws and regulations are complex and apply broadly to our business, and from time to time we notify relevant authorities of instances where weare not in full compliance with these requirements or otherwise discover privacy issues, and we expect to continue to do so as any such issues arise in thefuture. In addition, regulatory and legislative privacy requirements are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation.For example, we will be subject to new restrictions and requirements under the DMA, including in areas such as the combination of data across services andproduct design, which will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement. If we are unable to successfully implement and comply withthe mandates of the FTC consent order, GDPR, CPRA, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, DSA, or other regulatory or legislative requirements, or if we are found to bein violation of the consent order or other applicable requirements, we may be subject to regulatory or governmental investigations or lawsuits, which may resultin significant monetary fines, judgments, or other penalties, and we may also be required to make additional changes to our business practices. Any of theseevents could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.We may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our products or as a result of claimsrelated to our products, and legislation regulating content on our platform may require us to change our products or business practices and may adverselyaffect our business and financial results.We have faced, currently face, and will continue to face claims relating to information or content that is published or made available on our products,including our policies, algorithms, and enforcement actions with respect to such information or content. In particular, the nature of our business exposes us toclaims related to defamation, dissemination of misinformation or news hoaxes, discrimination, harassment, intellectual property rights, rights of publicity andprivacy, personal injury torts, laws regulating hate speech or other types of content, online safety, products liability, consumer protection, and breach ofcontract, among others. For example, we have recently seen an increase in claims brought by younger users related to well-being issues based on allegedlyharmful content that is shared on or recommended by our products. The potential risks relating to any of the foregoing types of claims are currently enhanced incertain jurisdictions40Table of Contentsoutside the United States where our protection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear or where we may be less protected under local laws than weare in the United States. For example, in April 2019, the European Union passed a directive (the European Copyright Directive) expanding online platformliability for copyright infringement and regulating certain uses of news content online, which member states are currently implementing into their nationallaws. In addition, the European Union revised the European Audiovisual Media Service Directive to apply to online video-sharing platforms, which memberstates have begun to implement. In the United States, the U.S. Supreme Court recently agreed to review a matter in which the scope of the protections availableto online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (Section 230) is at issue. In addition, there have been, and continue to be, variousstate and federal legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections under Section 230, as well as to impose new obligations ononline platforms with respect to commerce listings, user content, counterfeit goods and copyright-infringing material, and our current protections from liabilityfor third-party content in the United States could decrease or change. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we arefound liable, significant damages. We could also face fines, orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies, or other government-imposedremedies as a result of content hosted on our services. For example, legislation in Germany and India has resulted in the past, and may result in the future, inthe imposition of fines or other penalties for failure to comply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation, and disclosure obligations.Numerous other countries in Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposingpotentially significant penalties, including fines, service throttling, or advertising bans, for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certainprocesses. For example, we have been subject to fines and may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media legislation in Turkey,and we have been subject to fines and service blocking and prohibition in Russia. Content-related legislation also has required us in the past, and may requireus in the future, to change our products or business practices, increase our costs, or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certaingeographies. For example, the European Copyright Directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations for copyrighted content or to implementmeasures to prevent the availability of that content, which may require us to make substantial investments in compliance processes. Member states' lawsimplementing the European Copyright Directive may also require online platforms to pay for content. In addition, our products and services will be subject tonew restrictions and requirements, and our compliance costs may significantly increase, as a result of the Digital Services Act in the European Union, whichwill apply to our business as early as June 2023, and potentially other content-related legislative developments such as proposed online safety bills in Irelandand the United Kingdom. Certain countries have also proposed legislation that may require us to pay publishers for certain news content shared on ourproducts. In the United States, changes to the protections available under Section 230 or the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution or new state or federalcontent-related legislation may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affectuser growth and engagement. Any of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and financial results.Payment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that couldharm our business.Several of our products offer Payments functionality, including enabling our users to purchase tangible, virtual, and digital goods from merchants anddevelopers that offer applications using our Payments infrastructure, send money to other users, and make donations to certain charitable organizations, amongother activities. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, including those governing anti-moneylaundering and counter-terrorist financing, money transmission, stored value, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfer, virtualcurrency, consumer protection, charitable fundraising, trade sanctions, and import and export restrictions. Depending on how our Payments products evolve,we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling, banking, and lending. In some jurisdictions, the application orinterpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear. To increase flexibility in how our use of Payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty,we have received certain payments licenses in the United States, the European Economic Area, and other jurisdictions, which will generally require us todemonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas. Our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and resultin diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance. In the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal orregulatory requirements, we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order, or we may be required to make productchanges, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.In addition, we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of Payments transactions, including: increased costs and diversion of managementtime and effort and other resources to deal with bad transactions or customer disputes; potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users, developers,employees, or third parties; restrictions on the41Table of Contentsinvestment of consumer funds used to transact Payments; and additional disclosure and reporting requirements. We have also launched payments functionalityon certain of our applications and may in the future undertake additional payments initiatives, including as part of our metaverse efforts, which may subject usto many of the foregoing risks and additional licensing requirements.Risks Related to Data, Security, and Intellectual PropertySecurity breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, or other cyber incidentscould harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.Our industry is prone to cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users' data or to disrupt our ability to provide service.Our products and services involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of a large amount of data. Any failure to prevent or mitigate securitybreaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, including personal information, content, or payment information from users, orinformation from marketers, could result in the loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, or other misuse of such data, which could harm our business andreputation and diminish our competitive position. In addition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (such as spear phishing attacks), scraping, andgeneral hacking continue to be prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems in the past, and will occur on our systems in the future. We alsoregularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user accounts, purchase ads, or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming,spreading misinformation, or other objectionable ends. As a result of our prominence, the size of our user base, the types and volume of personal data andcontent on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services (including our efforts involving new and emerging technologies), we believe thatwe are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks, including from nation states and highly sophisticated, state-sponsored, or otherwise well-funded actors, and we experience heightened risk from time to time as a result of geopolitical events. Our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platformalso increase the risk of retaliatory attacks. Such breaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide, degrade the user experience, causeusers or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products, impair our internal systems, or result in financial harm to us. Our efforts to protect our companydata or the information we receive, and to disable undesirable activities on our platform, may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technicalmalfunctions; employee, contractor, or vendor error or malfeasance, including defects or vulnerabilities in our vendors' information technology systems orofferings; government surveillance; breaches of physical security of our facilities or technical infrastructure; or other threats that evolve. In addition, thirdparties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users' data. Cyber-attackscontinue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we have developed systems andprocesses that are designed to protect our data and user data, to prevent data loss, to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform, and to preventor detect security breaches, we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security, that we will be able to react in a timely manner, or that ourremediation efforts will be successful. The changes in our work environment as a result of certain personnel working remotely could also impact the security ofour systems, as well as our ability to protect against attacks and detect and respond to them quickly.In addition, some of our developers or other partners, such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads, may receive or store informationprovided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with our products. We provide limited information to such third parties based onthe scope of services provided to us. However, if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of abreach of their networks, our data or our users' data may be improperly accessed, used, or disclosed.We experience such cyber-attacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time, and we incur significant costs in protecting againstor remediating such incidents. In addition, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad relating to cybersecurity and dataprotection, as well as obligations under our modified consent order with the FTC. As a result, affected users or government authorities could initiate legal orregulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches or improper access to or disclosure of data, which has occurred in thepast and which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices. Suchincidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may also result in a decline in our active user base or engagement levels. Any of these events could have amaterial and adverse effect on our business, reputation, or financial results.42Table of ContentsFor example, in September 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal useraccess tokens, which were then used to access certain profile information from approximately 29 million user accounts on Facebook. The events surroundingthis cyber-attack became the subject of Irish Data Protection Commission and other government inquiries. Any such inquiries could subject us to substantialfines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect ourbusiness.We anticipate that our ongoing efforts related to privacy, safety, security, and content review will identify additional instances of misuse of user data orother undesirable activity by third parties on our platform.In addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks, we are making significant investments in privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts tocombat misuse of our services and user data by third parties, including investigations and audits of platform applications, as well as other enforcement efforts.As a result of these efforts we have discovered and announced, and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce, additional incidents of misuse ofuser data or other undesirable activity by third parties. We may not discover all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data or technicallimitations, including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, the allocation of resources to other projects, orother factors, and we may be notified of such incidents or activity by the independent privacy assessor required under our modified consent order with the FTC,the media, or other third parties. Such incidents and activities have in the past, and may in the future, include the use of user data or our systems in a mannerinconsistent with our terms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper advertising practices,activities that threaten people's safety on- or offline, or instances of spamming, scraping, data harvesting, unsecured datasets, or spreading misinformation. Wemay also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate any such incidents. Consequences of any of the foregoing developmentsinclude negative effects on user trust and engagement, harm to our reputation and brands, changes to our business practices in a manner adverse to ourbusiness, and adverse effects on our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries,which could subject us to monetary penalties and damages, divert management's time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.Our products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities in these systems, orfailures to address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems, could adversely affect our business.Our products and internal systems rely on software and hardware, including software and hardware developed or maintained internally and/or by thirdparties, that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store,retrieve, process, and manage immense amounts of data. The software and hardware on which we rely has contained, and will in the future contain, errors,bugs, or vulnerabilities, and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise our ability to meet our objectives. Some errors, bugs,or vulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. For example, inSeptember 2018, we announced our discovery of a third-party cyber-attack that exploited a vulnerability in Facebook's code to steal user access tokens andaccess certain profile information from user accounts on Facebook. Errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, design defects, or technical limitations within the software andhardware on which we rely, or human error in using such systems, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including a negativeexperience for users and marketers who use our products, compromised ability of our products to perform in a manner consistent with our terms, contracts, orpolicies, delayed product introductions or enhancements, targeting, measurement, or billing errors, compromised ability to protect the data of our users and/orour intellectual property or other data, or reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services. For example, we make commitments to our users as tohow their data will be collected, used, shared, and retained within and across our products, and our systems are subject to errors, bugs and technical limitationsthat may prevent us from fulfilling these commitments reliably. In addition, any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, or defects in our systems or the software andhardware on which we rely, failures to properly address or mitigate the technical limitations in our systems, or associated degradations or interruptions ofservice or failures to fulfill our commitments to our users, have in the past led to, and may in the future lead to, outcomes including damage to our reputation,loss of users, loss of marketers, loss of revenue, regulatory inquiries, litigation, or liability for fines, damages, or other remedies, any of which could adverselyaffect our business and financial results.43Table of ContentsIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may beadversely affected.We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with our employees, consultants, andthird parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect ourproprietary rights. In the United States and internationally, we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property, andwe currently hold a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applicationsfrom third parties. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, andpending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in everycountry in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all of these cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in orderto prevent infringement or to enforce our rights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance thatothers will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. In addition, we regularly contribute softwaresource code under open source licenses and have made other technology we developed available under other open licenses, and we include open sourcesoftware in our products. As a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be required to license ordisclose code and/or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk. If the protection of ourproprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may bediminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products, services, and methods of operations. Any of these events could have anadverse effect on our business and financial results.We are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and timeconsuming and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.Companies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and frequentlyenter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various "non-practicing entities" that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value fromtechnology companies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas where we historically have not competed,which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and non-practicing entities.From time to time, we receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and services, or user content, infringetheir intellectual property rights. We presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face increasing competition and developnew products and services, we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow. Defending patent and other intellectualproperty litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomeswill be obtained in all cases. In addition, plaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any suchlitigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations. We may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes onterms that are unfavorable to us. Similarly, if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment thatmay not be reversed upon appeal. The terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amountsto the other party. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party's rights, which may not be availableon reasonable terms, or at all, and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices. The development of alternative non-infringing technology or practices could require significanteffort and expense, could result in less effective technology or practices or otherwise negatively affect the user experience, or may not be feasible. We haveexperienced unfavorable outcomes in such disputes and litigation in the past, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adverselyaffected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above.44Table of ContentsRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common StockThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile.The trading price of our Class A common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our Class A common stock were sold inour initial public offering in May 2012 at a price of $38.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from $17.55 to $384.33 through December 31, 2022. Inaddition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our Class A common stock has in the past fluctuated and may in thefuture fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results for either of our reportable segments;•the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet these projections;•actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow ourcompany, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;•additional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us, our existing stockholders, or in connection with acquisitions, or the anticipation ofsuch sales;•investor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures,or capital commitments;•announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base, the level of user engagement, or theeffectiveness of our ad products;•changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry, including our developers and competitors;•price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;•the inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&P 500 Index;•media coverage of our business and financial performance;•lawsuits threatened or filed against us, or developments in pending lawsuits;•adverse government actions or legislative or regulatory developments relating to advertising, competition, content, privacy, or other matters, includinginterim or final rulings by tax, judicial, or regulatory bodies;•trading activity in our share repurchase program; and•other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, pandemics, and other disruptive external events, or responses tothese events.In addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices ofequity securities of many technology companies. We are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our platform and user data practices and themisuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for thesecond quarter of 2018; a former employee's allegations and release of internal company documents beginning in September 2021; and the disclosure of ourearnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. Any securities litigation couldsubject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.45Table of ContentsWe do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future.We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation andexpansion of our business and fund our share repurchase program, and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As aresult, you may only receive a return on your investment in our Class A common stock if the trading price of your shares increases.The dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control with ourCEO and certain other holders of our Class B common stock; this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters.Our Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Holders of our Class B common stock,including our founder, Chairman, and CEO, together hold a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock, and therefore are able tocontrol the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common stock represent at least 9.1% of alloutstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for theforeseeable future.Transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions,such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have theeffect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example,Mr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, continue to controla majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock.Our status as a "controlled company" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.Because we qualify as a "controlled company" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, we are not required to have a majorityof our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. In the future we couldelect not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function.Accordingly, should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the sameprotections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Our status as acontrolled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.Delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressingthe trading price of our Class A common stock.Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent achange in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomesan interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our current certificate of incorporation andbylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:•until the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the combined voting power of ourcommon stock, any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding Class Bcommon stock voting as a separate class;•we currently have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mr. Zuckerberg with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiringstockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;46Table of Contents•when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock, certainamendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval of two-thirds of the combined vote of our then-outstanding sharesof Class A and Class B common stock;•when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock,vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;•when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, ourboard of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors will only be able to be removed fromoffice for cause;•when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, ourstockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;•only our chairman, our chief executive officer, our president, or a majority of our board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting ofstockholders;•advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting ofstockholders;•our certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established, and shares of which may be issued,without stockholder approval; and•certain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware.47Table of ContentsItem 1B.Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2.PropertiesOur corporate headquarters are located in Menlo Park, California. As of December 31, 2022, we owned and leased approximately 10 million square feetof office and building space for our corporate headquarters and in the surrounding areas. However, beginning in the third quarter of 2022, we made a decisionto either sublease, early terminate, or abandon several office buildings under operating leases. We also owned and leased approximately 62 acres of land to bedeveloped to accommodate anticipated future growth.In addition, we have offices in more than 90 cities across North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific, and Latin America. We also own21 data centers locations globally.See Note 3 — Restructuring in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and SupplementaryData" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our facilities consolidation efforts.We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs.Item 3.Legal ProceedingsBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States andelsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action inconnection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation ofour terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal courtin the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earningsresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. DistrictCourt for the Northern District of California with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. OnSeptember 25, 2019, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to amend. On November 15,2019, a second amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. On August 7, 2020, the district court granted our motion todismiss the second amended complaint, with leave to amend. On October 16, 2020, a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securitiesclass action. On December 20, 2021, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint, with prejudice. On January 17, 2022, theplaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case, and the appeal is now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Withrespect to the multiple putative class actions filed against us beginning on March 20, 2018 alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection, privacy, andother laws in connection with the same matters, several of the cases brought on behalf of consumers in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. DistrictCourt for the Northern District of California. On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidatedputative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for a payment of$725 million by us and is subject to court approval. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certaindata by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States,Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 andrequired us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneysgeneral inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing and could subject us to additional substantial fines and costs, require usto change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business. On July 16, 2021, astockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Chancery Court against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and relatedclaims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amendedderivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of our current andformer directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead48Table of Contentsplaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. We believe the lawsuits described above are without merit,and we are vigorously defending them.We also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulatorsregarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. For example, in August 2020, we received a preliminary draft decision from the IDPC thatpreliminarily concluded that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses in respect of European Union/European Economic AreaFacebook user data does not achieve compliance with the GDPR and preliminarily proposed that transfers of such user data from the European Union to theUnited States should therefore be suspended. In February 2022, we received a revised preliminary draft decision in which the IDPC maintained its preliminaryconclusion that these transfers should be suspended. The IDPC's draft decision was then further refined and shared on July 6, 2022 with other European dataprotection regulators (CSAs) as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism. Separately, on October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order onEnhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities, and on December 13, 2022, the European Commission published its draft adequacydecision on the proposed new European Union-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. On January 19, 2023, the IDPC referred the inquiry to a vote by the EuropeanData Protection Board, pursuant to the dispute resolution process under Article 65 GDPR, in respect of elements of the draft decision over which consensuscould not be reached between concerned supervisory authorities. We believe a final decision in this inquiry may issue as early as the first quarter of 2023. Foradditional information, see Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors—Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regardingprivacy, data use and data protection, content, competition, safety and consumer protection, e-commerce, and other matters" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any such inquiries or investigations (including the IDPC proceeding) could subject us to substantial fines and costs, require us to change our businesspractices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.In addition, we are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competition authorities in the UnitedStates, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of socialnetworking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in June 2019 we wereinformed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint against us in the U.S.District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 ofthe Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintainingconditions on access to our platform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the U.S.Department of Justice and state attorneys general. On December 9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam, and the District ofColumbia filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation ofSection 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. Thecomplaint also alleged that we violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The complaints of the FTC and attorneys generalboth sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture orreconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the court granted our motions to dismiss the complaints filed by the FTC and attorneys general,dismissing the FTC's complaint with leave to amend and dismissing the attorneys general's case without prejudice. On July 28, 2021, the attorneys general fileda notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case and that appeal is now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. OnAugust 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, thecourt denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint. Multiple putative class actions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the UnitedStates and in the United Kingdom against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and/or otheralleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users in the UnitedStates were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On January 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part,our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions. On March 1, 2022, a first amended consolidated complaint was filed in the putative class action brought onbehalf of certain advertisers. On December 6, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the first amended consolidated complaint filed in the putative classaction brought on behalf of certain advertisers. In addition, on July 27, 2022, the FTC filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the NorthernDistrict of California seeking to preliminarily enjoin our proposed acquisition of Within Unlimited as an alleged violation of antitrust law. The FTCsubsequently filed a related complaint in49Table of Contentstheir administrative court seeking to permanently enjoin the transaction as a violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and seeking other relief as well. Webelieve these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them. In December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement ofObjections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition rules. The result ofsuch litigation, investigations or inquiries could subject us to substantial monetary remedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our business practices,divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business.Beginning in January 2022, we became subject to litigation and other proceedings that were filed in various federal and California state courts allegingthat Facebook and Instagram cause "social media addiction" in teenage users, resulting in various mental health and other harms. A putative class actionalleging similar harms was also filed in California state court on behalf of users under the age of 13 and three school districts recently filed public nuisanceclaims based on similar allegations. On October 6, 2022, the federal cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.The state court proceedings are now pending before a trial judge from Los Angeles County Superior Court. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and weare vigorously defending them. We are also subject to government investigations and requests from multiple regulators concerning the use of our products, andthe related mental and physical health and safety impacts on teenage users.We are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices. For example, beginningin September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal companydocuments concerning, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as misinformation andother undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. We have since received additional requests relating to these and other topics. Beginning onOctober 27, 2021, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against usand certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with the samematters, and seeking unspecified damages. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.On March 8, 2022, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain of ourdirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and seekingunspecified damages. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we are vigorously defending it.Beginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience sizefor advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern Districtof California and seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and 2022, the court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs'claims, but permitted its fraud and unfair competition claims to proceed. On March 29, 2022, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. OnJune 21, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted our petition for permission to appeal the district court's class certification order, and thedistrict court subsequently stayed the case. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we are vigorously defending it.In July 2017, an individual filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us and other companies for allegedlyviolating the Anti-Terrorism Act by aiding, abetting, and providing material support to an organization that committed an international terrorist act, and seekingunspecified damages. In October 2018, the district court granted our motion to dismiss. In June 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversedthe judgment. On October 3, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the judgment in this action, along with a companion case against another companyin which the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the scope of protection available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act(Section 230). We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we are vigorously defending it. However, changes to the protections available under Section 230may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect our business.On February 14, 2022, the State of Texas filed a lawsuit against us in Texas state court alleging that “tag suggestions" and other facial recognitionfeatures on our products violated the Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifiers Act and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, andseeking statutory damages and injunctive relief. The case is currently scheduled for trial in October 2023. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we arevigorously defending it.50Table of ContentsIn addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory agencies, including in particular in Brazil,Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, includingour obligation to disclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and penaltiesagainst us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorouslydefend such fines and penalties.We are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinarycourse of business, and we may in the future be subject to additional legal proceedings and disputes.Item 4.Mine Safety DisclosuresNot applicable.51Table of ContentsPART IIItem 5.Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesMarket Information for Common StockOn June 9, 2022, Meta's Class A common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol 'META'.

In addition to our historicalconsolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actualresults could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include thosediscussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors." For a discussion of limitations in themeasurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled "Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in theUnited States (GAAP), we present revenue on a constant currency basis and free cash flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Revenue on a constantcurrency basis is presented in the section entitled "—Revenue—Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue." To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, wetranslated revenue for the full year 2022 using 2021 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For a fulldescription of our free cash flow non-GAAP measure, see the section entitled "—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Free Cash Flow."These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared andpresented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non‑GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulnessfor comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investorsshould be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe these non-GAAPfinancial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financialresults between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metricsused by management in operating our business.Executive Overview of Full Year 2022 ResultsOur mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. In 2022, we continued to focus on our main revenuegrowth priorities: (i) helping marketers use our products to connect with consumers and (ii) making our ads more relevant and effective. We also continued toinvest in both our family of apps and our metaverse efforts based on our company priorities.Our financial results and key community metrics for 2022 are set forth below. Our total revenue for 2022 was $116.61 billion, a decrease of 1%compared to 2021, which reflects a $5.96 billion negative impact from the appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies. Revenue on aconstant currency basis was $122.57 billion for 2022, an increase of 4% compared to 2021. Our advertising revenue was impacted by a reduction in advertisingdemand during 2022 compared to 2021, which we believe was primarily driven by reduced marketer spending as a result of a more challengingmacroeconomic environment, as well as limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to iOS and the regulatory environment.Our average price per ad decreased by 16% year-over-year in 2022, partially offset by an 18% year-over-year increase in ad impressions delivered across ourFamily of Apps.Income from operations for 2022 was $28.94 billion, a decrease of $17.81 billion, or 38%, compared to 2021, mainly due to an increase in payroll andrelated expenses associated with a 20% increase in employee headcount particularly in engineering and other technical functions and higher operationalexpenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure. Starting in the third quarter of 2022, we began a series of cost management initiativesincluding facilities consolidation, a layoff of approximately 11,000 employees, and a pivot in our data center strategy, which resulted in total restructuringcharges of $4.61 billion in 2022. We expect we may incur significant additional restructuring charges as we continue to focus on cost efficiency measuresthrough 2023.54Table of ContentsConsolidated and Segment ResultsWe report our financial results for our two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL).

Our reported headcount includes a substantial majority of theapproximately 11,000 employees impacted by the layoff we announced in November 2022, who will no longer be reflected in our headcount by the endof the first quarter of 2023.RestructuringIn 2022, we initiated several measures to pursue greater efficiency and to realign our business and strategic priorities. This includes a facilitiesconsolidation strategy to sublease, early terminate, or abandon several office buildings under operating leases, a layoff of approximately 11,000 of ouremployees across the FoA and RL segments, and a pivot towards a next generation data center design, including cancellation of multiple data center projects.A summary of our restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2022 by major activity type is as follows (in millions):Facilities ConsolidationSeverance and OtherPersonnel CostsData Center AssetsTotalCost of revenue$154 $— $1,341 $1,495 Research and development1,311 408 — 1,719 Marketing and sales404 234 — 638 General and administrative426 333 — 759 Total$2,295 $975 $1,341 $4,611 Total restructuring charges recorded under our FoA segment were $4.10 billion and RL segment were $515 million. These charges lowered our operatingmargin by four percentage points and diluted earnings per share (EPS) by $1.34. The impact of severance and other personnel costs recorded in the fourthquarter of 2022 was not material after offsetting with the savings from the decreases in payroll, bonus and other benefits expenses.See Note 3 — Restructuring in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and SupplementaryData" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding restructuring charges.55Table of ContentsFamily of Apps Metrics•Family daily active people (DAP) was 2.96 billion on average for December 2022, an increase of 5% year-over-year.•Family monthly active people (MAP) was 3.74 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 4% year-over-year.•Facebook daily active users (DAUs) were 2.00 billion on average for December 2022, an increase of 4% year-over-year.•Facebook monthly active users (MAUs) were 2.96 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of 2% year-over-year.•Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps increased by 18% year-over-year in 2022, and the average price per ad decreased by 16% year-over-year in 2022.Developments in AdvertisingSubstantially all of our revenue is currently generated from advertising on Facebook and Instagram. We rely on targeting and measurement tools thatincorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users. Ouradvertising revenue has been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by reduced marketer spending as a result of limitations on our ad targetingand measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating systems and browsers.In particular, legislative and regulatory developments such as the General Data Protection Regulation, ePrivacy Directive, and California Privacy RightsAct have impacted our ability to use data signals in our ad products, and we expect these and other developments such as the Digital Markets Act will havefurther impact in the future. As a result, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, changes to our products and user data practices, whichreduce our ability to effectively target and measure ads. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, haveimplemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to targetand measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOSoperating system that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect willcontinue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms.To mitigate these developments, we are working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the performance of our ad products. We are developingprivacy enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads and measurement capabilities while reducing the amount of personal information we process, includingby relying more on anonymized or aggregated third-party data. In addition, we are developing tools that enable marketers to share their data into our systems,as well as ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps. More broadly, we also continue to innovate our advertising tools to help marketersprepare campaigns and connect with consumers, including developing growing formats such as Reels ads and our business messaging ad products. Across allof these efforts, we are making significant investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve our delivery, targeting, and measurementcapabilities. We are also engaging with others across our industry to explore the possibility of new open standards for the private and secure processing of datafor advertising purposes. We expect that some of these efforts will be long-term initiatives, and that the regulatory and platform developments described abovewill continue to adversely impact our advertising revenue for the foreseeable future.Other Business and Macroeconomic ConditionsOther global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions also have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impact on ouruser growth and engagement and advertising revenue. In particular, we believe advertising budgets have been pressured by factors such as inflation, risinginterest rates, and related market uncertainty, which has led to reduced marketer spending. In addition, competitive products and services have reduced someusers' engagement with our products and services. In response to competitive pressures, we have introduced new features such as Reels and are investing in ourartificial intelligence-powered discovery engine to recommend relevant unconnected content across our products. While Reels is growing in usage, it is notcurrently monetized at the same rate as our feed or Stories products. We also have seen fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one ormore markets from time to time. For example, in connection with the war in Ukraine, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and theservices were then prohibited by the Russian government, which adversely affected user growth and engagement in 2022. These trends adversely affectedadvertising revenue in 2022, and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue in the foreseeable future.56Table of ContentsThe COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted our business and results of operations, with a varied impact on user growth and engagement, as well as thedemand for and pricing of our ads from period to period. While we experienced a reduction in advertising demand and a related decline in pricing during theonset of the pandemic, we believe the pandemic subsequently contributed to an acceleration in the growth of online commerce, and we experienced increasingdemand for advertising as a result of this trend. More recently, we believe this growth has declined, and we saw continued softening of advertising demand in2022 as many activities that shifted online during COVID-19 related lockdowns resumed in person. We may experience similar volatility in the demand for andpricing of our advertising services as a result of the pandemic in the future.Although we regularly evaluate a variety of sources to understand trends in our advertising revenue, we do not have perfect visibility into the factorsdriving advertiser spending decisions and our assessments involve complex judgments about what is driving advertising decisions across a large and diversifiedadvertiser base across the globe. Trends impacting advertising spend are also dynamic and interrelated. As a result, it is difficult to identify with precisionwhich advertiser spending decisions are attributable to which trends, and we are unable to quantify the exact impact that each trend had on our advertisingrevenue during the periods presented.Investment PhilosophyIn 2022, we continued to invest based on the following company priorities: (i) continue making progress on the major social issues facing the internetand our company, including privacy, safety, and security; (ii) build new experiences that meaningfully improve people's lives today and set the stage for evenbigger improvements in the future; (iii) keep building our business by supporting the millions of businesses that rely on our services to grow and create jobs;and (iv) communicate more transparently about what we're doing and the role our services play in the world.We anticipate that investments in our data center capacity, servers, network infrastructure, and headcount will continue to drive expense growth in 2023,which will adversely affect our operating margin and profitability. The majority of our investments are directed toward developing our family of apps. In 2022,82% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and 18% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments include expenses relating to headcount,data centers and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. We are also making significant investments inour metaverse efforts, including developing virtual and augmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundationaltechnologies for the metaverse. Our RL investments include expenses relating to headcount and technology development across these efforts. Many of our RLinvestments are directed toward long-term, cutting-edge research and development for products for the metaverse that are not on the market today and mayonly be fully realized in the next decade. Although it is inherently difficult to predict when and how the metaverse ecosystem will develop, we expect our RLsegment to continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, and our ability to support our metaverse efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profitsfrom other areas of our business. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative. We are investing now because we believe this is the nextchapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digitalgoods.57Table of ContentsTrends in Our Family MetricsThe numbers for our key Family metrics, our DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP), do not include users on our other products unlessthey would otherwise qualify as DAP or MAP, respectively, based on their other activities on our Family products.Trends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show, thevalue of our ads to marketers, as well as our expenses and capital expenditures. Substantially all of our daily and monthly active people (as defined below)access our Family products on mobile devices.•Daily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp(collectively, our "Family" of products) who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web ormobile browser on a given day. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, andtherefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of DAP rely upon complextechniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of theseproducts, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to asingle person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed basedon internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in ourestimates. We view DAP, and DAP as a percentage of MAP, as measures of engagement across our products. For additional information, see thesection entitled "Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.DAP/MAP:79%79%79%78%79%79%79%79%79%Note: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statisticalvariances and errors. While we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period, we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwideMAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using ourproducts may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. For additional information, see the section entitled "Limitations of Key Metrics and OtherData" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the first quarter of 2021, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, andwe estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 60 million DAP to our reported worldwide DAP in March 2021. In the third quarter of 2022, we updated our Familymetrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 30 million DAP to ourreported worldwide DAP in September 2022.Worldwide DAP increased 5% to 2.96 billion on average during December 2022 from 2.82 billion during December 2021.58Table of Contents•Monthly Active People (MAP). We define a monthly active person as a registered and logged-in user of one or more Family products who visited atleast one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser in the last 30 days as of the date ofmeasurement. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and therefore mustseek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of MAP rely upon complex techniques,algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products, includingby matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, andcounting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based on internal reviewsof limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates. We viewMAP as a measure of the size of our global active community of people using our products. For additional information, see the section entitled"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Note: We report the numbers of DAP and MAP as specific amounts, but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statisticalvariances and errors.

In the first quarter of 2021, we updated our Family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, andwe estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 70 million MAP to our reported worldwide MAP in March 2021. In the third quarter of 2022, we updated our Familymetrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data, and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 40 million MAP to ourreported worldwide MAP in September 2022.As of December 31, 2022, we had 3.74 billion MAP, an increase of 4% from 3.59 billion as of December 31, 2021.59Table of Contents•Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP). We define ARPP as our total revenue during a given quarter, divided by the average of the number of MAP atthe beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPP includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAP used in this calculation only includes users ofour Family products as described in the definition of MAP above.

We define a daily active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through our website or amobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), on a given day. We view DAUs, and DAUs as a percentageof MAUs, as measures of user engagement on Facebook.DAU/MAU:66%66%66%66%66%67%67%67%67% DAU/MAU:76%75%75%75%74%75%75%74%75%DAU/MAU:74%73%73%73%72%73%74%74%75% DAU/MAU:62%62%62%63%63%64%64%64%65%DAU/MAU:65%65%65%66%65%66%66%66%66%Note: For purposes of reporting DAUs, MAUs, and ARPU by geographic region, Europe includes all users in Russia and Turkey and Rest of World includes all users in Africa, Latin America,and the Middle East.61Table of ContentsWorldwide DAUs increased 4% to 2.00 billion on average during December 2022 from 1.93 billion during December 2021. Users in India, thePhilippines, and Bangladesh represented the top three sources of growth in DAUs during December 2022, relative to the same period in 2021.•Monthly Active Users (MAUs). We define a monthly active user as a registered and logged-in Facebook user who visited Facebook through ourwebsite or a mobile device, or used our Messenger application (and is also a registered Facebook user), in the last 30 days as of the date ofmeasurement. MAUs are a measure of the size of our global active user community on Facebook.  As of December 31, 2022, we had 2.96 billion MAUs, an increase of 2% from December 31, 2021. Users in India, Nigeria, and Bangladesh representedthe top three sources of growth in 2022, relative to the same period in 2021.62Table of ContentsTrends in Our Monetization by Facebook User GeographyWe calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods arepurchased, or consumer hardware products are shipped. We define ARPU as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter, divided by theaverage of the number of MAUs in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources of revenue, the number of MAUsused in this calculation only includes users of Facebook and Messenger as described in the definition of MAU above. While the share of revenue from userswho are not also Facebook or Messenger MAUs has grown over time, we estimate that revenue from users who are Facebook or Messenger MAUs representsthe substantial majority of our total revenue. See "Average Revenue Per Person (ARPP)" above for our estimates of trends in our monetization of our Familyproducts. The geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different averagerates. Our revenue and ARPU in regions such as United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those onlineand mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU in 2022 in the United States & Canada region was more than 11 times higher than in the Asia-Pacificregion.ARPU:$10.14 $9.27 $10.12 $10.00$11.57$9.54$9.82$9.41$10.86ARPU:$53.56 $48.03 $53.01 $52.34 $60.57 $48.29$50.25$49.13$58.77ARPU:$16.87$15.49$17.23$16.50$19.68$15.35$15.64$14.23$17.29 ARPU:$4.05$3.94$4.16$4.30$4.89$4.47$4.54$4.42$4.61ARPU:$2.77$2.64$3.05$3.14$3.43$3.14$3.35$3.21$3.52Note: Non-advertising revenue includes RL revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and FoA Other revenue, which consists of net fees we receive from developersusing our Payments infrastructure and revenue from various other sources.63Table of ContentsOur revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenue-generatingactivity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in Note 2 — Revenue in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "FinancialStatements and Supplemental Data" where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the addresses of our customers.Our annual worldwide ARPU in 2022, which represents the sum of quarterly ARPU during such period, was $39.63, a decrease of 3% from 2021. For2022, ARPU decreased by 9% in Europe and 4% in United States & Canada, and increased by 4% in Asia-Pacific and 8% in Rest of World. In addition, usergrowth was mostly in geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such as Asia‑Pacific and Rest of World. We expect that user growth in the future will beprimarily concentrated in those regions where ARPU is relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may decrease at a higher rate, or increase at a slower rate,relative to ARPU in any geographic region in a particular period, or potentially decrease even if ARPU increases in each geographic region.64Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requiresus to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoingbasis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under thecircumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgmentnecessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on ourconsolidated financial statements is material. We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with gross vs. net in revenue recognition, valuation ofnon-marketable equity securities, income taxes, loss contingencies, and valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill, intangible assets, and property andequipment, and their associated estimated useful lives, when applicable, have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore,we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 —Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statementsand Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Gross vs. Net in Revenue RecognitionFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third parties, there is significant judgment in evaluating whether we are the principal, and reportrevenue on a gross basis, or the agent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or servicesbefore they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion inestablishing price. The assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact our revenue and cost of revenuerecognized on the consolidated statements of income.Valuation of Non-marketable Equity SecuritiesFor our non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative, determining whethera non-marketable equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the non-marketable equity security we hold may require judgment in (a) assessment ofdifferences in rights and obligations associated with the instruments such as voting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion features, and(b) adjustments to the observable price for differences such as, but not limited to, rights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or mostadvantageous markets. In addition, the identification of observable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our investeecompanies, which may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions take place. Therefore, our fair value adjustment for these observable transactionsmay occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred. For non-marketable equity securities, we perform a qualitative assessment at eachreporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, theinvestee's financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; regulatory, economic or technological environment; operational andfinancing cash flows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair value of our non-marketable equity securities using the market approach and/or the income approach and recognize impairment loss in the consolidated statements of income ifthe estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. Estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates, forecast cash flows,holding period, and market data of comparable companies, among others.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision forincome taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained onexamination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing thathave been developed based upon analyses of appropriate65Table of Contentsarms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research and development tax credits are based on an assessment ofwhether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Although we believe that we haveadequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of thesematters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts andcircumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is differentfrom the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have amaterial impact on our financial condition and operating results.Loss ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business.Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with variouslegal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Therequirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and anyfailure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, weevaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and theamount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonablyestimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters andrelated reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of ourdefenses and the impact of negotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment isrequired to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted andunasserted matters. Certain factors, in particular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on updatedinformation available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be the result of new laws and preliminary interpretationsregarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it difficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully assertedagainst us. In addition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, aresubject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions are finalized, which can lead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result ofthese and other factors, we reasonably expect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be revised in future quarters.The ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable or if and when the reasonablypossible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess ofmanagement's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcomebecomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected. See Note 13 — Commitments and Contingencies and Note 16 — Income Taxes of theaccompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and Part I, Item 3,"Legal Proceedings" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.Valuation of Long-lived Assets including Goodwill, Intangible Assets, and Property and Equipment and Estimated Useful LivesWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on theirestimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded asgoodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Such valuations require management to make significant estimatesand assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, estimatedreplacement costs and future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, acquired patents, and trade66Table of Contentsnames from a market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to bereasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase considerationto identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas anyindefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisitiondate, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of themeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely thannot reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We have two reporting units subject to goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31,2022, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.Long-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events orcircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiablecash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carryingamounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that thecarrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.The useful lives of our long-lived assets including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are determined by management when thoseassets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. The current estimate of useful lives represents our bestestimate based on current facts and circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as changes to ourbusiness operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and technological advancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset,the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised remaining useful life.In connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, we extended the estimated average useful lives of ourservers and network assets category effective the second and the fourth quarters of 2022. The financial impact of the changes in estimates was a reduction indepreciation expense of $860 million and an increase in net income of $693 million, or $0.26 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2022. Theimpact from the changes in our estimates was calculated based on the servers and network assets existing as of the effective date of the change and applying therevised useful lives prospectively.See Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8,"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information regarding the changes in the estimated usefullives of our servers and network assets.67Table of ContentsComponents of Results of OperationsRevenueFamily of Apps (FoA)Advertising. We generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising. Our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook,Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertisingagencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions, such as clicks, taken by users.We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions areconsidered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes theaction the marketer contracted for. The number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and thestructure of our ads products. In particular, the number of ads we show may vary by product (for example, our video and Reels products are not currentlymonetized at the same rate as our feed or Stories products), and from time to time we increase or decrease the number or frequency of ads we show as part ofour product and monetization strategies. We calculate average price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered, representing theaverage price paid per ad by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action. For advertising revenue arrangements where we arenot the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis.Other revenue. Other revenue consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from WhatsApp BusinessPlatform and various other sources.Reality Labs (RL)RL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, wearables, and related software and content.Cost of Revenue and Operating ExpensesCost of revenue. Our cost of revenue consists mostly of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expensesrelated to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as wellas payroll and related expenses which include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost ofrevenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processingcustomer transactions, and content costs. Additionally, cost of revenue includes RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losseson non-cancelable contractual commitments.Research and development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses which include share-basedcompensation, facilities-related costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for developing new products as well asimproving existing products, RL technology development costs, and professional services.Marketing and sales. Marketing and sales expenses consist mostly of marketing and promotional expenses as well as payroll and related expenseswhich include share-based compensation for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, marketing, business development, and customer service functions.Our marketing and sales expenses also include professional services such as content reviewers to support our community and product operations.General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses which include share-basedcompensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications and policy, and other administrativeemployees; legal-related costs, which include estimated fines, settlements, or other losses in connection with legal and related matters, as well as other legalfees; professional services, and other taxes, such as digital services taxes, other tax levies.68Table of ContentsResults of OperationsIn this section, we discuss the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.

The decrease was mostly driven by advertising revenue.AdvertisingAdvertising revenue in 2022 decreased $1.29 billion, or 1%, compared to 2021 due to a decrease in the average price per ad, partially offset by anincrease in the number of ads delivered. In 2022, the average price per ad decreased by 16%, as compared with an increase of 24% in 2021. The decrease inaverage price per ad was driven by an increase in the number of ads delivered, especially in geographies and in products such as video and Reels that monetizeat lower rates, and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. In addition, the decrease in average price per ad was impacted by a reduction in advertisingdemand, which we believe was primarily driven by reduced marketer spending as a result of a more challenging macroeconomic environment and limitationson our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to iOS and the regulatory environment, as well as, to a lesser extent, the other factors discussedin the section entitled "—Executive Overview of Full Year 2022 Results." In 2022, the number of ads delivered increased by 18%, as compared with a 10%increase in 2021. Ads impressions grew in all regions during 2022, mostly driven by an increase in ads delivered in Asia-Pacific and Rest of World. Theincrease in the ads delivered during 2022 was driven by increases in the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products and an increase in users.We anticipate that future advertising revenue will be driven by a combination of price and the number of ads delivered.Reality LabsRL revenue in 2022 decreased $115 million, or 5%, compared to 2021. The decrease in RL revenue was driven by a decrease in the volume of MetaQuest sales.Revenue Seasonality and Customer ConcentrationRevenue is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. We believe that this seasonality inboth advertising revenue and RL consumer hardware sales affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the thirdand fourth quarters and a decline between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our total revenue increased 16%, 16%, and 31% between thethird and fourth quarters of 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, while total revenue for the first quarters of 2022, 2021, and 2020 declined 17%, 7%, and 16%compared to the fourth quarters of 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.Foreign Exchange Impact on RevenueThe general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 had anunfavorable impact on revenue. If we had translated revenue for the full year 2022 using the prior70Table of Contentsyear's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been$122.57 billion and $119.54 billion, respectively. Using these constant rates, total revenue and advertising revenue would have been $5.96 billion and$5.90 billion higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue, respectively, for the full year 2022. Using the same constant rates, full year 2022 totalrevenue and advertising revenue would have been $4.64 billion and $4.60 billion, respectively, higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue for thefull year 2021.Cost of revenueYear Ended December 31,2022202120202022 vs 2021 %change2021 vs 2020 %change(in millions, except percentages)Cost of revenue$25,249 $22,649 $16,692 11 %36 %Percentage of revenue22 %19 %19 %Cost of revenue in 2022 increased $2.60 billion, or 11%, compared to 2021. The increase was mainly due to an increase in operational expenses relatedto our data centers and technical infrastructure, adjusted for a decrease in the depreciation growth rate due to extensions in the useful lives of servers andnetwork assets. In addition, we recorded $1.34 billion of abandonment charges related to data center assets. These increases were partially offset by a decreasein RL inventory cost including lower losses on purchase commitments.See Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3 — Restructuring in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included inPart II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding changes in theestimated useful life of our servers and network assets as well as the abandonment charges related to data center assets, respectively.Research and developmentYear Ended December 31,2022202120202022 vs 2021 %change2021 vs 2020 %change(in millions, except percentages)Research and development$35,338 $24,655 $18,447 43 %34 %Percentage of revenue30 %21 %21 %Research and development expenses in 2022 increased $10.68 billion, or 43%, compared to 2021.

The decrease was mostly due to a decrease inother income (expense), net related to higher unrealized losses recognized for our equity investments and an increase in interest expense recognized on long-term debt.Provision for income taxesYear Ended December 31,2022202120202022 vs 2021 %change2021 vs 2020 %change(in millions, except percentages)Provision for income taxes$5,619 $7,914 $4,034 (29)%96 %Effective tax rate19.5 %16.7 %12.2 %Our provision for income taxes in 2022 decreased $2.29 billion, or 29%, compared to 2021, mostly due to a decrease in income from operations.Our effective tax rate in 2022 increased compared to 2021, mainly due to an increase in tax shortfalls recognized from share-based compensation and theeffect of regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022 on foreign tax credits, partially offset by an increase in tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income.Effective Tax Rate Items. Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the following items and income before provisionfor income taxes: U.S. tax benefits from foreign-derived intangible income, tax effects from share-based compensation, research tax credit, tax effects ofintegrating intellectual property from acquisitions, settlement of tax contingency items, tax effects of changes in our business, and the effects of changes in taxlaw.The accounting for share-based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-basedcompensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return, which depend upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting. If our stock priceremains constant to the January 27, 2023 price, and absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2023 to be in the lowtwenties. This includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses incurred in 2022, as required by the2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The mandatory capitalization requirement increased our 2022 cash tax liabilities materially but also decreased oureffective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the mandatory capitalization requirement is deferred, our effective taxrate in 2023 could be higher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities could be several billion dollars lower.Integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing ourprovision for income taxes. Consequently, our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition andintegration. The magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relativecontribution to income in subsequent periods.On August 16, 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The key tax provisions applicable to us are a 15% corporate minimum tax onbook income and a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases effective January 1, 2023. We do73Table of Contentsnot expect these tax law changes to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position; however, we will continue to evaluate their impact as furtherinformation becomes available.Unrecognized Tax Benefits. As of December 31, 2022, we had net uncertain tax positions of $5.49 billion which were accrued as other liabilities. Theseunrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing ofintellectual property, providing services and other transactions, as well as for uncertainties regarding the utilization of our research tax credits. The ultimatesettlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits, litigation, or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items. Basedupon the status of litigation described below and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions, we do not anticipate a material change to such amountswithin the next 12 months.See Note 16 — Income Taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and SupplementaryData" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding income tax contingencies.74Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. Cash and cashequivalents and marketable securities consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, U.S. government securities, U.S.government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $40.74 billion as ofDecember 31, 2022, a decrease of $7.26 billion from December 31, 2021. The majority of the decrease was due to $32.04 billion for capital expenditures,including principal payments on finance leases, $27.96 billion repurchases of our Class A common stock, $3.60 billion of taxes paid related to net sharesettlement of employee restricted stock unit (RSU) awards, and $1.31 billion for acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets. These decreases were partiallyoffset by $50.48 billion of cash generated from operations and $9.92 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of fixed-rate senior notes (the "Notes") in August2022.Cash paid for income taxes was $6.41 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, our federal net operating losscarryforward was $196 million and our federal tax credit carryforward was $276 million. We anticipate the utilization of most of these net operating losses andcredits within the next two years.Our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not havean expiration date. In 2022, we repurchased and subsequently retired 161 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of$27.93 billion. As of December 31, 2022, $10.87 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases. In January 2023, an additional $40 billion ofrepurchases was authorized under this program.The following table presents our cash flows (in millions):Year Ended December 31,202220212020Net cash provided by operating activities$50,475 $57,683 $38,747 Net cash used in investing activities$(28,970)$(7,570)$(30,059)Net cash used in financing activities$(22,136)$(50,728)$(10,292)Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesCash provided by operating activities during 2022 mostly consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as $11.99 billion of share-based compensation expense, $8.69 billion of depreciation and amortization, and $3.56 billion of impairment for leases, leasehold improvements, andabandonment charges for data center assets related to our restructuring efforts. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities during 2022 compared to2021 was mainly due to a decrease in net income as adjusted for the aforementioned non-cash items, partially offset by changes in working capital.Cash Used in Investing ActivitiesCash used in investing activities during 2022 mostly consisted of $31.19 billion of net purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest inservers, data centers, and network infrastructure, partially offset by $3.53 billion proceeds from net sales and maturities of marketable debt securities. Theincrease in cash used in investing activities during 2022 compared to 2021 was mostly due to an increase in net purchases of property and equipment, and adecrease in proceeds from net sales and maturities of marketable debt securities.We anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately $30 billion to $33 billion in 2023.Cash Used in Financing ActivitiesCash used in financing activities during 2022 mostly consisted of $27.96 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock and $3.60 billion of taxespaid related to net share settlement of RSUs, partially offset by $9.92 billion proceeds from the issuance of the Notes. The decrease in cash used in financingactivities during 2022 compared to 2021 was mostly due to a decrease in repurchases of our Class A common stock and proceeds from the issuance of theNotes.75Table of ContentsFree Cash FlowIn addition to other financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we monitor free cash flow (FCF) as a non-GAAP measure to manageour business, make planning decisions, evaluate our performance, and allocate resources. We define FCF as net cash provided by operating activities reducedby net purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases.We believe that FCF is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and provides useful information regardinghow cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and equipment investments required to maintain and grow our business.We have chosen our definition for FCF because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors betterunderstand underlying trends in our business. We use FCF in discussions with our senior management and board of directors.FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures,such as net cash provided by operating activities. FCF is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses. Some of thelimitations of FCF are:•FCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments; and•other companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.Management compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the FCF measure through disclosure of such limitations, presentation of ourfinancial statements in accordance with GAAP, and reconciliation of FCF to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operatingactivities, as presented below.The following is a reconciliation of FCF to the most comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities (in millions):Year Ended December 31,202220212020Net cash provided by operating activities$50,475 $57,683 $38,747 Purchases of property and equipment, net(31,186)(18,567)(15,115)Principal payments on finance leases(850)(677)(604)Free Cash Flow$18,439 $38,439 $23,028 Material Cash RequirementsWe currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations and financing activities will be sufficient to meet our operational cashneeds and fund our share repurchase program for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. We continuously evaluate our liquidityand capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance our future capital requirements.Leases and Contractual CommitmentsOur operating lease obligations mostly include, among others, offices, data centers, colocations, and land. Our finance lease obligations mostly includecertain network infrastructure. Our restructuring efforts to sublease, early terminate or abandon several office buildings under operating leases did notmaterially change our operating lease obligations.Our contractual commitments are primarily related to our investments in network infrastructure, servers, and consumer hardware products in RealityLabs.76Table of ContentsLong-term DebtIn August 2022, we issued an aggregate of $10.0 billion principal amount of the Notes. The Notes were issued in four series, which mature from 2027through 2062. Short-term and long-term future interest payments obligations as of December 31, 2022 are $411 million and $7.69 billion, respectively. Weintend to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include, but are not limited to, capital expenditures, repurchases ofoutstanding shares of our common stock, acquisitions, or investments.TaxesAs of December 31, 2022, we had taxes payable of $1.51 billion related to a one-time transition tax payable incurred as a result of the Tax Act, of which$361 million is due within one year. As permitted by the Tax Act, we will pay the transition tax in annual interest-free installments through 2025. Our otherliabilities also include $5.49 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of taxaudits, the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments.ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations. We record a liability when we believe thatit is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and that the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that wemay incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statementsto the extent material. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss. Such matters are inherentlyunpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove tobe incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.See Note 9 — Leases, Note 11 — Long-term Debt, Note 13 — Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 16 — Income Taxes in the notes to theconsolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, and "Legal Proceedings" contained in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K foradditional information regarding leases and contractual commitments, long-term debt, taxes, and contingencies.Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notesto consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.77Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risks, including changes to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity price risk.Foreign Currency Exchange RiskWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro.Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, have negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect,our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations — Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue section included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluingmonetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At thistime, we have not entered into, but in the future we may enter into, derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currencyexchange risk. It is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations. Foreign currency exchange net losses of$81 million, $140 million, and $129 million were recognized in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.Interest Rate SensitivityOur exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest income and market value of our cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, andthe fair value of our long-term debt.Our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities consist of cash, certificates of deposit, time deposits, money market funds, U.S. governmentsecurities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservationof capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketablesecurities, and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of$558 million and $714 million in the market value of our available-for-sale debt securities and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,respectively. Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes and from the current unrealized losses would only occur if we sold theinvestments prior to maturity.As of December 31, 2022, we also had $10.0 billion aggregate principal amount of fixed-rate senior notes (the "Notes") outstanding. Since our Notesbear interest at fixed rates and are carried at amortized cost, fluctuations in interest rates do not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements.However, the fair value of the Notes will fluctuate with movements in market interest rates, increasing in periods of declining interest rates and declining inperiods of increasing interest rates.Equity Price RiskOur equity investments are substantially all in non-marketable equity securities and are subject to equity price risks that could have a material impact onthe carrying value of our holdings.Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair values. We elected to account formost of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resultingfrom observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. We perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determinewhether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not limited to, the investee's financial conditionand business outlook; industry and sector performance; economic or technological environment; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee.Valuations of our non-marketable equity securities are complex due to the lack of readily available market data and observable transactions. Uncertainties inthe global economic climate and financial markets could adversely impact the valuation of these companies we invest in and, therefore, result in a materialimpairment or downward adjustment in our investments. Our total non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of $6.20 billion and $6.78 billion as ofDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.78Table of ContentsFor additional information, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 6 — Non-marketable Equity Securities, Note 7 — FairValue Measurements, and Note 11 — Long-term Debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statementsand Supplementary Data" and Part II, Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — CriticalAccounting Policies and Estimates" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.79Table of ContentsItem 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary DataMETA PLATFORMS, INC.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the relatedconsolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements presentfairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows foreach of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internalcontrol over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee ofSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 1, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financialstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company inaccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures toassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Suchprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluatingthe accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Webelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or requiredto be communicated to the Audit & Risk Oversight Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on theconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on thecritical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.81Table of ContentsLoss ContingenciesDescription of the MatterAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is party to various legal proceedings, claims, andregulatory or government inquiries and investigations. The Company accrues a liability when it believes a loss is probable and theamount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that it will incur a loss in some ofthese cases, actions or inquiries described above. When applicable, the Company discloses an estimate of the amount of loss orrange of possible loss that may be incurred. However, for certain other matters, the Company discloses that the amount of suchlosses or a range of possible losses cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.Auditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these loss contingencies was especially challenging due to thesignificant judgment required to evaluate management's assessments of the likelihood of a loss, and their estimate of the potentialamount or range of such losses.How We Addressed theMatter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the identification andevaluation of these matters, including controls relating to the Company's assessment of the likelihood that a loss will be realizedand their ability to reasonably estimate the potential range of possible losses.To test the Company's assessment of the probability of incurrence of a loss, whether the loss was reasonably estimable, and theconclusion and disclosure regarding any range of possible losses, including when the Company believes it cannot be reasonablyestimated at this time, we read the minutes or a summary of the meetings of the committees of the board of directors, read theproceedings, claims, and regulatory, or government inquiries and investigations, or summaries as we deemed appropriate,requested and received internal and external legal counsel confirmation letters, met with internal and external legal counsel todiscuss the nature of the various matters, and obtained representations from management. We also evaluated the appropriatenessof the related disclosures included in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.82Table of ContentsUncertain Tax PositionsDescription of the MatterAs discussed in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has received certain notices from the InternalRevenue Service (IRS) related to transfer pricing agreements with the Company's foreign subsidiaries for certain periodsexamined. The IRS has stated that it will also apply its position to tax years subsequent to those examined. If the IRS prevails inits position, it could result in an additional federal tax liability, plus interest and any penalties asserted. The Company usesjudgment to (1) determine whether a tax position's technical merits are more-likely-than-not to be sustained and (2) measure theamount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition.Auditing the Company's accounting for, and disclosure of, these uncertain tax positions was especially challenging due to thesignificant judgment required to assess management's evaluation of technical merits and the measurement of the tax positionbased on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings.How We Addressed theMatter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's processto assess the technical merits of tax positions related to these transfer pricing agreements and to measure the benefit of those taxpositions.As part of our audit procedures over the Company's accounting for these positions, we involved our tax professionals to assistwith our assessment of the technical merits of the Company's tax positions. This included assessing the Company'scorrespondence with the relevant tax authorities, evaluating income tax opinions or other third-party advice obtained by theCompany, and requesting and receiving confirmation letters from third-party advisors. We also used our knowledge of, andexperience with, the application of international and local income tax laws by the relevant income tax authorities to evaluate theCompany's accounting for those tax positions. We analyzed the Company's assumptions and data used to determine the amount ofthe federal tax liability recognized and tested the mathematical accuracy of the underlying data and calculations. We alsoevaluated the appropriateness of the related disclosures included in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in relation tothese matters./s/ Ernst & Young LLPWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2007.San Mateo, CaliforniaFebruary 1, 202383Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Meta Platforms, Inc.Opinion on Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited Meta Platforms, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control –Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In ouropinion, Meta Platforms, Inc.

Our responsibility isto express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with thePCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules andregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing andevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considerednecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial ReportingA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting andthe preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control overfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflectthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permitpreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are beingmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention ortimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLPSan Mateo, CaliforniaFebruary 1, 202384Table of ContentsMETA PLATFORMS, INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(In millions, except for number

ContentsMETA PLATFORMS, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNote 1. Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesOrganization and Description of BusinessWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004. Our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. All ofour products, including our apps, share the vision of helping to bring the metaverse to life.We report our financial results based on two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). The segment information aligns withhow the chief operating decision maker (CODM), who is our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), reviews and manages the business. We generate substantially allof our revenue from advertising.Basis of PresentationWe prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The consolidated financialstatements include the accounts of Meta Platforms, Inc., its subsidiaries where we have controlling financial interests, and any variable interest entities forwhich we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.Use of EstimatesPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amountsin the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assetsand liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on various otherassumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas, including, but notlimited to, those related to revenue recognition, valuation of non-marketable equity securities, income taxes, loss contingencies, including the ultimateresolution of litigation, regulatory matters, and asserted and unasserted claims, valuation of long-lived assets including goodwill, intangible assets, and propertyand equipment, and their associated estimated useful lives, credit losses of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities and accounts receivable, fair value offinancial instruments, and fair value of leases. These estimates are based on management's knowledge about current events, interpretation of regulations, andexpectations about actions we may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.In connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated useful lives of property and equipment, we extended the estimated average useful lives of amajority of the servers and network assets from four years to 4.5 years, effective the second quarter of 2022, and further extended the useful lives to five yearseffective the fourth quarter of 2022. The changes in estimated useful lives were due to expected longer refresh cycles in our data centers. The financial impactof the changes was a reduction in depreciation expense of $860 million and an increase in net income of $693 million, or $0.26 per diluted share for the yearended December 31, 2022. The impact from the changes in our estimates was calculated based on the servers and network assets existing as of the effectivedates of the changes and applying the revised estimated useful lives prospectively.Revenue RecognitionRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration weexpect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.We determine revenue recognition by applying the following steps:•identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;•identification of the performance obligations in the contract;•determination of the transaction price;•allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and91Table of Contents•recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.We expense sales commissions when incurred if the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within marketing and sales on ourconsolidated statements of income.We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and(ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed.Revenue excludes sales and usage‑based taxes where it has been determined that we are acting as a pass‑through agent.AdvertisingAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay forad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number ofactions, such as clicks, taken by our users.We recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions areconsidered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes theaction the marketer contracted for. In general, we report advertising revenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is transferredto our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. For revenuegenerated from arrangements that involve third-party publishers, we evaluate whether we are the principal or the agent, and for those advertising revenuearrangements where we are the agent, we recognize revenue on a net basis.We may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and certain customers may receive cash-based incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate theseamounts and reduce revenue based on the amounts expected to be provided to customers. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimatesof variable consideration.Reality Labs RevenueRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest, wearables, and related software and content. Revenue isrecognized at the time control of the products is transferred to customers, which is generally at the time of delivery, in an amount that reflects the considerationRL expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products.Other RevenueOther revenue consists of net fees we receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure and revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform andvarious other sources.Cost of RevenueOur cost of revenue consists mostly of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These include expenses related to theoperation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, as well as payrolland related expenses which include share-based compensation for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue alsoincludes costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processing customertransactions, and content costs. Additionally, cost of revenue includes RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments.Content CostsOur content costs are mostly related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and music to increase engagement on the platform.For licensed video, we expense the cost per title when the title is accepted and available92Table of Contentsfor viewing if the capitalization criteria are not met. Video content costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.For licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. Expensed content costs are included in cost of revenue on theconsolidated statements of income.Software Development CostsSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed or sold to externalusers, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological feasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.Software development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and applications used to deliver our services.These software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will becompleted and the software will be used to perform the function intended.Development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to date.Share-based CompensationShare-based compensation expense consists of the company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to employees are measured based onthe grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four years. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized based on thestraight-line basis over the requisite service period. We account for forfeitures as they occur.Income TaxesWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision forincome taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.We record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method.Under this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financialreporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the taxrates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize thedeferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment.We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We considerall available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxableincome and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained onexamination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing thathave been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research taxcredits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will besufficient. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide noassurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income taxaccounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final taxoutcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which suchdetermination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.93Table of ContentsAdvertising ExpenseAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on the consolidated statements of income. We incurredadvertising expenses of $2.65 billion, $2.99 billion, and $2.26 billion for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.Cash and Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities, and Restricted CashCash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks and highly liquid investments with maturities of 90 days or less from the date ofpurchase.We hold investments in marketable securities, consisting mostly of U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment gradecorporate debt securities. We classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale (AFS) investments in our current assets because they represent investmentsof cash available for current operations. Our AFS investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, included inaccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. AFS debt securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair value areassessed to determine what amount of that difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses. Allowance for credit losses on AFS debt securities arerecognized as a charge in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income, and any remaining unrealized losses, net of taxes,are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. The amounts of credit losses recorded for the years endedDecember 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were not material. We determine realized gains or losses on sale of marketable securities on a specific identificationmethod and include such gains or losses in interest and other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of income.We classify certain restricted cash balances, consisting mostly of cash related to insurance policies, and retention and indemnification holdback for ouracquisitions, within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets based upon the expected duration of therestrictions.Non-marketable Equity SecuritiesOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair values. We elected to account forsubstantially all of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fairvalue resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer as of the respective transaction dates. The change incarrying value, if any, is recognized in interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income. We periodically review our non-marketable equity securities for impairment. When indicators exist and the estimated fair value of an investment is below the carrying amount, we write downthe investment to fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2022, losses resulted from such remeasurements were $447 million. Gains and lossesrecorded in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were immaterial. For additional information, see Note 6 — Non-marketable Equity Securities.In addition, we also held other non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the equity method which were immaterial as of December 31, 2022and 2021.Fair Value MeasurementsWe apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair valuein the financial statements on a recurring basis. We define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in anorderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which arerequired to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based riskmeasurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transferrestrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levelsand bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:Level 1- Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.94Table of ContentsLevel 2- Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets orliabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets orliabilities.Level 3- Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management's estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricingthe asset or liability.Our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities are classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because their fair value is derivedfrom quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs. Our marketable equity securities are publicly tradedstocks measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets toestimate their fair value. Certain other assets are classified within Level 3 because factors used to develop the estimated fair value are unobservable inputs thatare not supported by market activity.Our non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Whenindicators of impairment exist or observable price changes of qualified transactions occur, the respective non-marketable equity security would be classifiedwithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the valuation methods include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date andother unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.Accounts Receivable and AllowancesAccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts. We makeestimates of expected credit and collectibility trends for the allowance for credit losses and allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment ofvarious factors, including historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of our customers, current economic conditions,reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. Expected creditlosses are recorded as general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the allowances foraccounts receivable were immaterial.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment, which includes amounts recorded under finance leases, which are amortized, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter.The estimated useful lives of property and equipment and amortization periods of finance lease right-of-use assets are described below:Property and Equipment Useful Life/ Amortization periodServers and network assetsFour to Five yearsBuildings25 to 30 yearsEquipment and otherOne to 25 yearsFinance lease right-of-use assetsThree to 20 yearsLeasehold improvementsLesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease termWe evaluate at least annually the recoverability of property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that thecarrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment assets is not recoverable,and the asset's fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded$1.34 billion of abandonment charges for data center construction in progress (CIP) assets under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 360 relatedto our restructuring efforts. For additional information regarding our restructuring efforts, see Note 3 — Restructuring.95Table of ContentsThe useful lives of our property and equipment are determined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed forthe remaining estimated useful lives. Our current estimate of useful lives represents the best estimate of the useful lives based on current facts andcircumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes to our business operations, changes in the planned use of assets, and technologicaladvancements. When we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectivelyand depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life. See section "Use of Estimates" above for additional information regarding changes in theestimated useful lives of our servers and network assets.Servers and network assets include property and equipment mostly in our data centers, which is used to support production traffic. Land and assets heldwithin construction in progress are not depreciated. Construction in progress is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that havenot yet been placed in service for their intended use.The cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulateddepreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in income from operations.Lease ObligationsWe have operating leases comprised of certain offices, data centers, colocations, land, network infrastructure, and other equipment. We also have financeleases for certain network infrastructure. We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Most of our leases contain lease and non-lease components.Non-lease components include fixed payments for maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-leasecomponents and account for them as a single lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent rent escalations, commonarea maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, or other costs. Such variable lease costs are expensed as incurred on the consolidated statements of income. Forcertain colocation and equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and leaseliabilities.For leases with a lease term greater than 12 months, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at thecommencement date based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease payments and includes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the timeof commencement.Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. When determiningthe probability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based, asset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors.As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencementdate in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our creditrating would be in a similar economic environment.Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on ourconsolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities onour consolidated balance sheets.Operating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms. Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over theshorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease terms.During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded impairment losses of $2.22 billion in aggregate for operating lease ROU assets and leaseholdimprovements under ASC Topic 360 as a part of our facilities consolidation restructuring efforts. The fair values of the impaired assets were estimated usingdiscounted cash flow models (income approach) based on market participant assumptions with Level 3 inputs. The assumptions used in estimating fair valueinclude the expected downtime prior to the commencement of future subleases, projected sublease income over the remaining lease periods, and discount ratesthat reflect the level of risk associated with receiving future cash flows. For additional information regarding our restructuring efforts, see Note 3 —Restructuring.96Table of ContentsLoss ContingenciesWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business.Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with variouslegal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Therequirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and anyfailure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, weevaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and theamount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonablyestimated, we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.We review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters andrelated reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of ourdefenses and the impact of negotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment isrequired to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted andunasserted matters. Certain factors, in particular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on updatedinformation available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be the result of new laws and preliminary interpretationsregarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it difficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully assertedagainst us. In addition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, aresubject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions can be finalized, which can lead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry. As a result ofthese and other factors, we reasonably expect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be revised in future quarters.Business CombinationsWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on theirestimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded asgoodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets andliabilities affects the amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangibleassets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustmentsto the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequentadjustments are recorded to earnings. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from business combinations and are expensed as incurred.Goodwill and Intangibles AssetsWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from business combinations. We evaluate our reporting units annually, as well aswhen changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill istested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fairvalue of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We have two reporting units subject to goodwill impairment testing. As of December 31, 2022, noimpairment of goodwill has been identified.We evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carryingamount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation of these intangible assets are performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows arelargely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to thefuture undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount offinite-lived intangible assets is not recoverable, and the assets fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. We have notrecorded any material impairment charges during the years presented.97Table of ContentsOur finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets arenot amortized. If an indefinite-lived intangible asset is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life, the asset will be tested for impairment andaccounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We routinely review the remaining estimated useful livesof finite-lived intangible assets. If we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance is amortized over therevised estimated useful life.Foreign CurrencyGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries toU.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Translation gains andlosses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we hadcumulative translation losses, net of tax of $1.86 billion and $677 million, respectively.Foreign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary involvedare recorded within interest and other income (expense), net on our consolidated statements of income. Net losses resulting from foreign currency transactionswere $81 million, $140 million, and $129 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.Credit Risk and ConcentrationOur financial instruments that are potentially subject to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash,marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents consists mostly of money market funds, that primarily invest in U.S. government and agencysecurities. Marketable securities consist of investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debtsecurities. Our investment portfolio in corporate debt securities is highly liquid and diversified among individual issuers. The amount of credit losses recordedfor the year ended December 31, 2022 was not material.Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from customers across different industries and countries. We generated40%, 41%, and 42% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, from marketers and developers based in the UnitedStates, with the majority of revenue outside of the United States coming from customers located in western Europe, China, Brazil, Canada, Australia and Japan.We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. We maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses,and bad debt expense on these losses was not material during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020. In the event that accounts receivablecollection cycles deteriorate, our operating results and financial position could be adversely affected.No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.Recently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsOn January 1, 2022, we early adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for ContractAssets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2021-08), which clarifies that an acquirer of a business should recognize and measurecontract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue fromContracts with Customers. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.On July 1, 2022, we early adopted ASU No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject toContractual Sale Restrictions (ASU 2022-03), which clarifies and amends the guidance of measuring the fair value of equity securities subject to contractualrestrictions that prohibit the sale of the equity securities. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financialstatements.On October 1, 2022, we adopted ASU No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosure by Business Entities about Government Assistance(ASU 2021-10), which improves the transparency of government assistance received98Table of Contentsby most business entities by requiring annual disclosures of: (1) the types of government assistance received; (2) the accounting for such assistance; and (3) theeffect of the assistance on a business entity's financial statements. The adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidatedfinancial statements.Note 2.

RestructuringDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we initiated several measures to pursue greater cost efficiency and to realign our business and strategicpriorities.Beginning in the third quarter of 2022, as a part of our facilities consolidation strategy, we made a decision to sublease, early terminate, or abandonseveral office buildings under operating leases to align our real property lease arrangements with our anticipated operating needs. As a result, we recordedimpairment charges for the related operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and leasehold improvements.In November 2022, we announced a layoff of approximately 11,000 of our employees across the FoA and RL segments. As a result, we recordedseverance and other personnel related expenses for the impacted employees.In December 2022, we reevaluated our data center investment strategy to improve efficiency and further advance our efforts around artificialintelligence. As a result, we decided to pivot several of our data center building projects to a next generation design while also canceling multiple existing datacenter projects. This strategy led to abandonment charges of the related data center assets.A summary of our restructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2022 by major activity type is as follows (in millions):Facilities ConsolidationSeverance and OtherPersonnel CostsData Center AssetsTotalCost of revenue$154 $— $1,341 $1,495 Research and development1,311 408 — 1,719 Marketing and sales404 234 — 638 General and administrative426 333 — 759 Total$2,295 $975 $1,341 $4,611 ________________________(1)Facilities consolidation includes impairment charges and accelerated expenses related to certain operating lease ROU assets and leasehold improvements.Total restructuring charges recorded under our FoA segment were $4.10 billion and RL segment were $515 million.The following table is a summary of the changes in the severance and other personnel liabilities, included within accrued expenses and other currentliabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, related to the workforce reduction (in millions):Balance as of January 1, 2022$— Severance and other personnel costs975 Cash payments during the period(203)Balance as of December 31, 2022 $772 __________________________(1)We expect the remaining severance and termination related liabilities to be substantially paid out in cash during the first half of 2023.(1)(1)100Table of ContentsNote 4. Earnings per ShareWe compute earnings per share (EPS) of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method. As the liquidation and dividend rights for bothClass A and Class B common stock are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis to the weighted-average number of commonshares outstanding for the period.Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B common stock outstanding. Forthe calculation of diluted EPS, net income for basic EPS is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including awards under our equity compensation plan.In addition, the computation of the diluted EPS of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of our Class B common stock to Class A commonstock, while the diluted EPS of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares to Class A common stock. Diluted EPS is computed bydividing the resulting net income by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding.For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 95 million shares of Class A common stock equivalents of restricted stock units (RSUs) wereexcluded from the diluted EPS calculation as including them would have an anti-dilutive effect. RSUs with anti-dilutive effect were not material for the yearsended December 31, 2021 and 2020.Basic and diluted EPS are the same for each class of common stock because they are entitled to the same liquidation and dividend rights.The numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS computations for our common stock are calculated as follows (in millions, except pershare amounts): Year Ended December 31, 202220212020 ClassAClassBClassAClassBClassAClassB Basic EPS:      Numerator      Net income$19,729 $3,471 $33,328 $6,042 $24,607 $4,539 Denominator      Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share2,285 402 2,383 432 2,407 444 Basic EPS$8.63 $8.63 $13.99 $13.99 $10.22 $10.22 Diluted EPS:    Numerator      Net income$19,729 $3,471 $33,328 $6,042 $24,607 $4,539 Reallocation of net income as a result of conversion of Class B toClass A common stock3,471 — 6,042 — 4,539 — Reallocation of net income to Class B common stock— (19)— (93)— (58)Net income for diluted EPS$23,200 $3,452 $39,370 $5,949 $29,146 $4,481 Denominator      Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share2,285 402 2,383 432 2,407 444 Conversion of Class B to Class A common stock402 — 432 — 444 — Weighted-average effect of dilutive RSUs15 — 44 — 37 — Shares used in computation of diluted earnings per share2,702 402 2,859 432 2,888 444 Diluted EPS$8.59 $8.59 $13.77 $13.77 $10.09 $10.09 101Table of ContentsNote 5.

Long-term DebtIn August 2022, we issued an aggregate of $10.0 billion principal amount of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes in four series (the “Original Notes”) in aprivate offering to qualified institutional buyers and certain non-U.S. persons. The proceeds from this offering, net of discounts and debt issuance costs, was$9.92 billion. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include, but are not limited to, capitalexpenditures, repurchases of outstanding shares of our common stock, acquisitions, or investments. In connection with the offering, we entered into aregistration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") providing for the filing of a registration statement with the Securities and ExchangeCommission in order to exchange the Original Notes for registered notes having substantially the same terms.On November 29, 2022, we commenced an offer to exchange (the "Exchange Offer") the Original Notes for new registered notes (the "Exchange Notes"and, together with the Original Notes, the "Notes") in order to fulfill our obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement. The Exchange Offer expired onDecember 28, 2022 and settled on December 29, 2022. We did not receive any proceeds from the Exchange Offer, and the aggregate principal amount of theExchange Notes that were issued was equal to the aggregate principal amount of the Original Notes that were surrendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer. Eachseries of the Exchange Notes is part of the same series of the applicable series of the Original Notes and the terms of the Exchange Notes offered in theExchange Offer are substantially identical to the terms of the respective series of the Original Notes, except that the Exchange Notes are registered under theSecurities Act, and certain transfer restrictions, registration rights, and additional interest provisions relating to the Original Notes do not apply to the ExchangeNotes. The Notes of each series rank equally with each other and we are not subject to any financial covenants. We may redeem each series of the Notes at anytime in whole or in part, at specified redemption prices.The following table summarizes the Notes and the carrying amount of our debt as of December 31, 2022 (in millions, except percentages):MaturityStated Interest RateEffective Interest RateDecember 31, 20222027 Notes20273.50%3.63%$2,750 2032 Notes20323.85%3.92%3,000 2052 Notes20524.45%4.51%2,750 2062 Notes20624.65%4.71%1,500 Total face amount of long-term debt10,000 Unamortized discount and issuance costs, net(77)Long-term debt$9,923 Interest on each of the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in February and August of each year, commencing in February 2023.

Commitments and ContingenciesGuaranteeIn 2018, we established a multi-currency notional cash pool for certain of our entities with a third-party bank provider, which was terminated onDecember 2, 2022. As a result, the parental guarantee by Meta Platforms, Inc. was no longer required.Contractual CommitmentsWe have $19.91 billion of non-cancelable contractual commitments as of December 31, 2022, which are primarily related to our investments in networkinfrastructure, servers, and consumer hardware products in Reality Labs. The following is a schedule, by years, of non-cancelable contractual commitments asof December 31, 2022 (in millions):2023$13,203 20242,295 20251,434 2026265 2027209 Thereafter2,504 Total$19,910 Additionally, as part of the normal course of business, we have entered into multi-year agreements to purchase renewable energy that do not specify afixed or minimum volume commitment or to purchase certain server components that do not specify a fixed or minimum price commitment. We enter intothese agreements in order to secure either volume or price. Using the projected market prices or expected volume consumption, the total estimated spend as ofDecember 31, 2022(1)110Table of Contentsis approximately $10.34 billion, a majority of which is due beyond five years. The ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based onprevailing market prices or actual volume purchased.In January 2023, we entered into multi-year agreements to purchase renewable energy in the amount of approximately $1.6 billion.Legal and Related MattersBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States andelsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action inconnection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation ofour terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal courtin the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earningsresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. DistrictCourt for the Northern District of California with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices. OnSeptember 25, 2019, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action, with leave to amend. On November 15,2019, a second amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action. On August 7, 2020, the district court granted our motion todismiss the second amended complaint, with leave to amend. On October 16, 2020, a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securitiesclass action. On December 20, 2021, the district court granted our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint, with prejudice. On January 17, 2022, theplaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case, and the appeal is now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Withrespect to the multiple putative class actions filed against us beginning on March 20, 2018 alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection, privacy, andother laws in connection with the same matters, several of the cases brought on behalf of consumers in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. DistrictCourt for the Northern District of California. On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidatedputative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for a payment of$725 million by us and is subject to court approval. In addition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certaindata by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States,Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020. Amongother matters, our settlement with the FTC required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion which was paid in April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modifiedconsent order. The state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing. On July 16, 2021, a stockholderderivative action was filed in Delaware Chancery Court against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claimsrelating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an amendedderivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of our current andformer directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a secondamended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. We believe the lawsuits described above are without merit, and we are vigorouslydefending them.We also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulatorsregarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. For example, we are currently subject to an IDPC inquiry regarding Meta Platforms Ireland's ability totransfer European Union/European Economic Area Facebook user data to the United States, which is described further in "Legal Proceedings" contained inPart I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC aresubject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR's consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the finaloutcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. Although we are vigorously defending our regulatory compliance, we have accrued significant amounts forloss contingencies related to these inquiries and investigations in Europe, and we believe there is a reasonable possibility that additional accruals for lossesrelated to these matters could be material in the aggregate.111Table of ContentsBeginning in January 2022, we became subject to litigation and other proceedings that were filed in various federal and California state courts allegingthat Facebook and Instagram cause "social media addiction" in teenage users, resulting in various mental health and other harms. A putative class actionalleging similar harms was also filed in California state court on behalf of users under the age of 13 and three school districts recently filed public nuisanceclaims based on similar allegations. On October 6, 2022, the federal cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.The state court proceedings are now pending before a trial judge from Los Angeles County Superior Court. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and weare vigorously defending them. We are also subject to government investigations and requests from multiple regulators concerning the use of our products, andthe related mental and physical health and safety impacts on teenage users.We are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices. For example, beginningin September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to a former employee's allegations and release of internal companydocuments concerning, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as misinformation andother undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. We have since received additional requests relating to these and other topics. Beginning onOctober 27, 2021, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against usand certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with the samematters, and seeking unspecified damages. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.On March 8, 2022, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain of ourdirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and seekingunspecified damages. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we are vigorously defending it.Beginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience sizefor advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern Districtof California and seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and 2022, the court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs'claims, but permitted its fraud and unfair competition claims to proceed. On March 29, 2022, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. OnJune 21, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted our petition for permission to appeal the district court's class certification order, and thedistrict court subsequently stayed the case. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we are vigorously defending it.In addition, we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory agencies, including in particular in Brazil,Russia, and other countries in Europe, in order to ascertain the precise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies, includingour obligation to disclose user information in particular circumstances. A number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and penaltiesagainst us. We believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties, and we intend to vigorouslydefend such fines and penalties.With respect to the cases, actions, and inquiries described above, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability whenwe believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss insome of these matters. With respect to the matters described above that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible loss, such losses orrange of possible losses either cannot be estimated or are not individually material, but we believe there is a reasonable possibility that they may be material inthe aggregate.We are also party to various other legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinarycourse of business. For example, we are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competitionauthorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practicesin the areas of social networking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, inJune 2019 we were informed by the FTC that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint againstus in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation ofSection 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp112Table of Contentsin 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. In addition, beginning in the third quarter of 2019, we became the subject of antitrustinvestigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general. On December 9, 2020, the attorneys general from 46 states, the territory of Guam,and the District of Columbia filed a complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitiveconduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions onaccess to our platform. The complaint also alleged that we violated Section 7 of the Clayton Act by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. The complaints of theFTC and attorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our company's alleged violations of the antitrust laws, and other equitable relief,including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the court granted our motions to dismiss the complaints filed by theFTC and attorneys general, dismissing the FTC's complaint with leave to amend and dismissing the attorneys general's case without prejudice. On July 28,2021, the attorneys general filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case and that appeal is now pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for theDistrict of Columbia Circuit. On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to dismiss this amendedcomplaint. On January 11, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the FTC's amended complaint. Multiple putative class actions have also been filed instate and federal courts in the United States and in the United Kingdom against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connectionwith these acquisitions and/or other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and injunctive relief. Several of the cases brought on behalf ofcertain advertisers and users in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. On January 14, 2022, thecourt granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions. On March 1, 2022, a first amended consolidated complaint was filedin the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. On December 6, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the first amendedconsolidated complaint filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. In addition, on July 27, 2022, the FTC filed a complaintagainst us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California seeking to preliminarily enjoin our proposed acquisition of Within Unlimited as analleged violation of antitrust law. The FTC subsequently filed a related complaint in their administrative court seeking to permanently enjoin the transaction asa violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and seeking other relief as well. We believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending them.In December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in amanner that infringes European Union competition rules.On February 14, 2022, the State of Texas filed a lawsuit against us in Texas state court alleging that “tag suggestions" and other facial recognitionfeatures on our products violated the Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifiers Act and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, andseeking statutory damages and injunctive relief. The case is currently scheduled for trial in October 2023. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we arevigorously defending it.Additionally, we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world. The requirements for complying with theseobligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any failure to comply with such obligationscould eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these other legal proceedings, claims, regulatory, tax, or government inquiries andinvestigations, and other matters, asserted and unasserted, we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe aloss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss in some of theseother matters. We believe that the amount of losses or any estimable range of possible losses with respect to these other matters will not, either individually orin the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements.The ultimate outcome of the legal and related matters described in this section, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, orprobable, or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolvedagainst us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of loss, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting periodin which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.For information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 16 — Income Taxes.IndemnificationsIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions of services and products, we have agreed to indemnify certain parties with respect to certainmatters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual propertyinfringement or other claims made by third parties.113Table of ContentsThese agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered intoindemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain employees, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain similar indemnificationobligations.It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnificationclaims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had amaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, as of December 31, 2022, there was not a reasonable possibility we had incurred amaterial loss with respect to indemnification of such parties. We have not recorded any liability for costs related to indemnification through December 31,2022.Note 14. Stockholders' EquityCommon StockOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of Class A common stock and Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2022, we areauthorized to issue 5,000 million shares of Class A common stock and 4,141 million shares of Class B common stock, each with a par value of $0.000006 pershare.

As of December 31, 2022, we have not declared any dividends.The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote, while the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes.Shares of our Class B common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of ourClass A common stock upon transfer. Class A common stock and Class B common stock are collectively referred to as common stock throughout the notes tothese financial statements, unless otherwise noted.As of December 31, 2022, there were 2,247 million shares of Class A common stock and 367 million shares of Class B common stock issued andoutstanding.Share Repurchase ProgramOur board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our Class A common stock, which commenced in January 2017 and does not havean expiration date. As of December 31, 2021, $38.79 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases under this program. In 2022, we repurchasedand subsequently retired 161 million shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $27.93 billion. As of December 31, 2022, $10.87 billionremained available and authorized for repurchases. In January 2023, an additional $40 billion of repurchases was authorized under this program.The timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the repurchase program depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business andmarket conditions, and other investment opportunities, and shares may be repurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions,including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.Share-based Compensation PlanWe have one active share-based employee compensation plan, the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan (Amended 2012 Plan), which was amended in each ofJune 2016, February 2018, and December 2022. Our Amended 2012 Plan provides for the issuance of incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted stockawards, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, performance shares, and stock bonuses to qualified employees, directors, and consultants. Shares that are withheld inconnection with the net settlement of RSUs or forfeited are added to the reserves of the Amended 2012 Plan.As of December 31, 2022, there were 66 million shares of our Class A common stock reserved for future issuance under our Amended 2012 Plan.Pursuant to the automatic increase provision under our Amended 2012 Plan, the number of shares reserved for issuance increases automatically on January 1 ofeach of the calendar years during the term of the Amended 2012 Plan, which will continue through April 2026, by a number of shares of Class A common stockequal to the lesser of (i) 2.5% of the total issued and outstanding shares of our Class A common stock as of the immediately preceding114Table of ContentsDecember 31st or (ii) a number of shares determined by our board of directors. Pursuant to this automatic increase provision, our board of directors approvedan increase of 56 million shares of Class A common stock reserved for issuance, effective January 1, 2023.In December 2022, our board of directors approved an amendment to our Amended 2012 Plan to increase the number of shares reserved for issuanceunder the Amended 2012 Plan by 425 million shares, effective March 1, 2023 (Plan Amendment). The Plan Amendment was also approved by holders of amajority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in December 2022.The following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2022:Number of SharesWeighted-Average GrantDate Fair Value PerShare(in thousands)Unvested at December 31, 202198,848 $244.32 Granted106,693 $195.66 Vested(54,013)$218.24 Forfeited(24,418)$231.98 Unvested at December 31, 2022127,110 $216.93 The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $305.40 and $188.73, respectively.The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $9.44 billion,$14.42 billion, and $9.38 billion, respectively. The income tax benefit recognized related to awards vested during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021,and 2020 was $2.0 billion, $3.08 billion, and $1.81 billion, respectively.As of December 31, 2022, there was $26.01 billion of unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to RSU awards.

We have federal tax credit carryforwards of $276 million, which will begin to expire in 2029, if not utilized, andstate tax credit carryforwards of $3.72 billion, most of which do not expire.Utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitationsprovided by the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. Such annual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and taxcredit carryforwards before their utilization. The events that may cause ownership changes include, but are not limited to, a cumulative stock ownership changeof greater than 50% over a three‑year period.The following table reflects changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions): Year Ended December 31,  202220212020Gross unrecognized tax benefits ‑ beginning of period$9,807 $8,692 $7,863 Increases related to prior year tax positions210 328 356 Decreases related to prior year tax positions(172)(86)(253)Increases related to current year tax positions1,166 963 1,045 Decreases related to settlements of prior year tax positions(254)(90)(319)Gross unrecognized tax benefits ‑ end of period$10,757 $9,807 $8,692 117Table of ContentsThese unrecognized tax benefits were primarily accrued for the uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includelicensing of intellectual property, providing services and other transactions, as well as for the uncertainties with our research tax credits. During all yearspresented, we recognized interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements ofincome. The amount of interest and penalties accrued as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $1.07 billion and $960 million, respectively.If the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits of $10.76 billion as of December 31, 2022 were realized in a future period, this would result in a taxbenefit of $6.49 billion within our provision of income taxes at such time.We are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject topotential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2014 through 2019 taxyears. Our 2020 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination by the IRS and the Irish Revenue Commissioners.In July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunctionwith the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax yearssubsequent to 2010 and has done so in years covered by the second Notice described below. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed apetition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS's amendment to answer was filed stating that it planned to assert at trial anadjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first session of the trial was completed in March 2020 and the final trial session wascompleted in August 2022. We expect the Tax Court to issue an opinion in 2024. Based on the information provided, we believe that, if the IRS prevails in itsupdated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $9.0 billion in excess of theamounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties asserted.In March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The IRS applied itsposition from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries andcertain tax credits that we claimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up toapproximately $680 million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with thepositions of the IRS in the second Notice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.We have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740), that is lower thanthe potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in the two Notices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevailsin its positions related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the taxthat we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As of December 31, 2022, we have notresolved these matters and proceedings continue in the Tax Court.We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other taxitems that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it isreasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remainingthat are subject to examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If the taxauthorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financialposition, results of operations, and cash flows.118Table of ContentsNote 17.

RL includes augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware, software,and content. Our operating segments are the same as our reportable segments.Our Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision maker (CODM), who allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operatingsegment using information about the operating segment's revenue and income (loss) from operations. Our CODM does not evaluate operating segments usingasset or liability information.Revenue and costs and expenses are generally directly attributed to our segments. These costs and expenses include certain product development relatedoperating expenses, costs associated with partnership arrangements, consumer hardware product costs, content costs, and legal-related costs. Indirect costs areallocated to segments based on a reasonable allocation methodology, when such costs are significant to the performance measures of the operating segments.Indirect cost of revenue is allocated to our segments based on usage, such as costs related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure.Indirect operating expenses, such as facilities, information technology, certain shared research and development activities, recruiting, and physical securityexpenses, are mostly allocated based on headcount.The following table sets forth our segment information of revenue and income (loss) from operations (in millions).

Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that as of December 31,2022, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information weare required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periodsspecified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) underthe Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth inInternal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on theassessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022 to provide reasonable assuranceregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our independent registered publicaccounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 ofthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.Changes in Internal ControlThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) ofthe Exchange Act during the fourth quarter of 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financialreporting.Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial ReportingIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that anycontrols and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Inaddition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraintsand that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.Item 9B.Other InformationNone.Item 9C.Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent InspectionsNot Applicable.120Table of ContentsPART IIIItem 10.Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate GovernanceThe information required by this item is incorporated by reference to our Proxy Statement for the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be filed withthe SEC within 120 days of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.Our board of directors has adopted a Code of Conduct applicable to all officers, directors, and employees, which is available on our website(investor.fb.com) under "Leadership & Governance."
