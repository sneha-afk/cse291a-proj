PART II
Item 5.Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “OrCL.” According to the records of our transfer agent, we had 8,511

For equity compensation plan information, please refer to Item 12 in Part III of this Annual report.
Stock Repurchase Program
Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On September 11, 2019 and March 12, 2020, we announced
that our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program totaling $30.0 billion. As of May 31, 2020, approximately $16.6 billion
remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program.
Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital
needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic
and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock
repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.
The following table summarizes the stock repurchase activity for the three months ended May 31, 2020 and the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet
be purchased pursuant to our stock repurchase program:

Item 6.Selected Financial Data
The following table sets forth selected financial data as of and for our last five fiscal years. This selected financial data should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 15 of this Annual report. Over our last five fiscal years, we have acquired a number of
companies, including NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite) in fiscal 2017. The results of our acquired companies have been included in our consolidated financial statements
since their respective dates of acquisition and have contributed to our revenues, income, earnings per share and total assets.
As of and for the Year Ended May 31,
(in millions, except per share amounts) 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016(4)
Consolidated Statements of Operations Data:
Total revenues $ 39,068 $ 39,506 $ 39,383 $ 37,792 $ 37,047
Operating income $ 13,896 $ 13,535 $ 13,264 $ 12,913 $ 12,604
Net income(1) $ 10,135 $ 11,083 $ 3,587 $ 9,452 $ 8,901
Earnings per share—diluted(1) $ 3.08 $ 2.97 $ 0.85 $ 2.24 $ 2.07
Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 3,294 3,732 4,238 4,217 4,305
Cash dividends declared per common share $ 0.96 $ 0.81 $ 0.76 $ 0.64 $ 0.60
Consolidated Balance Sheets Data:
Working capital(2) $ 34,940 $ 27,756 $ 57,035 $ 50,995 $ 47,105
Total assets(2) $ 115,438 $ 108,709 $ 137,851 $ 136,003 $ 112,180
Notes payable and other borrowings(3) $ 71,597 $ 56,167 $ 60,619 $ 57,909 $ 43,855
(1) Our net income and diluted earnings per share were impacted in fiscal 2019 and 2018 by the effects of our adoption of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act). The more significant
provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described in our Annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019.
(2) Working capital and total assets increased in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our fiscal 2020 net income and the issuance of $20.0 billion of
long-term senior notes in fiscal 2020, partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments in fiscal 2020. Working capital and total assets decreased in fiscal 2019
primarily due to $36.1 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock during fiscal 2019 and also due to dividend payments, partially offset by the favorable impacts to our net current assets
resulting from our fiscal 2019 net income. Working capital and total assets sequentially increased in the fiscal 2016 to 2018 periods presented primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net current
assets resulting from our net income generated during the periods presented and the issuance of long-term senior notes of $10.0 billion in fiscal 2018 and $14.0 billion in fiscal 2017. These working
capital and total assets increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments in the fiscal 2016 to 2018 periods presented. In addition,
our total assets were also affected in all periods presented by the repayments of notes payable and other borrowings as discussed further below.
(3) Our notes payable and other borrowings, which represented the summation of our notes payable, current, and notes payable and other borrowings, non-current, as reported per our consolidated
balance sheets as of the dates listed in the table above, increased during fiscal 2020 primarily due to the issuance of $20.0 billion of long-term senior notes. Notes payable and other borrowings
decreased during fiscal 2019 primarily due to repayments of certain short-term borrowings and senior notes. Notes payable and other borrowings increased between fiscal 2016 and 2018 primarily due
to the fiscal 2018 issuance of long-term senior notes of $10.0 billion and short-term borrowings of $2.5 billion, the fiscal 2017 issuance of long-term senior notes of $14.0 billion and short-term
borrowings of $3.8 billion, and fiscal 2016 short-term borrowings of $3.8 billion. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report for additional
information regarding our notes payable and other borrowings.
(4) The summary consolidated financial data for the fiscal year ended and as of May 31, 2016 have not been updated to reflect the adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) or
ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Costs and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Costs (ASU 2017-07). refer to our Annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
May 31, 2019 for additional discussion regarding Oracle’s adoption of these accounting pronouncements.

Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues were flat in fiscal 2020. The constant currency increase in our cloud and license business’
revenues during fiscal 2020 was offset by decreases in our hardware business’ revenues and services business’ revenues. The constant currency increase in our
cloud and license business’ revenues during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 was attributable to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues as
customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud deployment models and license deployment models and renewed their related
cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gain access to our latest technologies and support services. The constant currency decrease in our
hardware business’ revenues during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 was due to reductions in our hardware products revenues and hardware support revenues
primarily due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our cloud-based infrastructure technologies, which resulted in reduced sales volumes of
certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of customers that purchased hardware support contracts. The constant currency decrease in
our services business’ revenues during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 was attributable to declines in our consulting revenues and education revenues. Due to
the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, all three of our businesses’ revenues were adversely impacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and some of these
effects may continue into fiscal 2021. While we expect these effects to be temporary, the impacts of COVID-19 for fiscal 2021 and future periods are unknown.
On a constant currency basis, fiscal 2020 total revenues growth in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions were partially offset by a decline in the Americas region.
Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total operating expenses decreased during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower
expenses for substantially all of our operating expense categories other than cloud services and license support expenses, which increased primarily due to
headcount and infrastructure investments that were made to support the increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues; and research and development
expenses, which increased primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expenses. We curtailed a number of variable expenditures in our fourth quarter of
fiscal 2020 including marketing

conditions improve.
In constant currency, our total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues increased in fiscal 2020 due to the decline in our

Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges
To supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe that the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial
performance and prospects for the future.
Our operating results reported pursuant to GAAP included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions and
certain other expense and income items that affected our GAAP net income:
Year Ended May 31,
(in millions) 2020 2019
Cloud services and license support deferred revenues(1) $ 4 $ 20
Amortization of intangible assets(2) 1,586 1,689

$ 2,547 $ 2,054
(1) In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support contracts assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we
did not recognize the cloud services and license support revenue amounts as presented in the above table that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities
upon delivery of the contractual obligations. To the extent customers for which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full
contracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods.
(2) represents the amortization of intangible assets, substantially all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions. As of May 31, 2020, estimated future amortization related to intangible
assets was as follows (in millions):
Fiscal 2021 $ 1,351
Fiscal 2022 1,102
Fiscal 2023 679
Fiscal 2024 445
Fiscal 2025 126
Thereafter 35
Total intangible assets, net $ 3,738
(3) Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments
after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net.
(4) restructuring expenses during fiscal 2020 and 2019 primarily related to employee severance in connection with our Fiscal 2019 Oracle restructuring Plan (2019 restructuring Plan). Additional
information regarding certain of our restructuring plans is provided in the discussion below under “restructuring Expenses” and in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this Annual report.

(6) For fiscal 2020 and 2019, the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to our income before provision for income taxes after excluding the tax effects of items within the table above such as for stock-
based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, and certain other acquisition related items; and, for fiscal 2019, after excluding a tax benefit arising from the increase of a deferred
tax asset associated with a partial realignment of our legal structure and a tax benefit as described in footnote (7) below, resulted in effective tax rates of 18.4% and 18.5% in fiscal 2020 and 2019,
respectively, instead of 16.0% and 9.7%, respectively, which represented our effective tax rates as derived per our consolidated statements of operations.
(7) The fiscal 2019 income tax reform adjustment presented in the table above was due to an adjustment made pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) related to the enactment of the
U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act). The more significant provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described in our Annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019.
Cloud and License Business
Our cloud and license business engages in the sale and marketing of our applications and infrastructure technologies that are delivered through various
deployment models and include: Oracle license support offerings; Oracle Cloud Services offerings; and Oracle cloud license and on-premise license offerings.
License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud licenses and on-premise licenses; are purchased
by our customers at their option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. Our cloud services
deliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspecified updates
and enhancements for, host, manage and support. revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized over the contractual term, which is generally one to
three years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned
from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and
on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and
use. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market
certain of our offerings through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services and license support
expenses, and sales and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud services and
license support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings, and marketing program costs.

(1) Includes cloud services and license support revenue adjustments related to certain cloud services and license support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded as revenues by the acquired
businesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our GAAP-based consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to business combination accounting requirements.
Such revenue adjustments were included in our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs. See “Presentation of Operating Segment results and Other Financial
Information” above for additional information.
(2) Excludes stock-based compensation and certain expense allocations. Also excludes amortization of intangible assets and certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating
segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segment results and Other Financial Information” above.
Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total revenues increased in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 due to growth in
our cloud services and license support revenues, which was primarily due to increased customer purchases and renewals of cloud-based services and license
support contracts in recent periods for which we delivered such services during fiscal 2020. Our cloud and license business’ revenues were adversely impacted
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular our cloud license and on-premise license revenues. In constant currency, the
Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 8%, 34% and 58%, respectively, of the constant currency revenue growth for this business in fiscal 2020.
In constant currency, our total cloud and license business’ expenses increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 due to higher cloud services and license
support expenses during fiscal 2020, which were primarily attributable to higher employee related expenses and higher technology infrastructure expenses to
support the increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues. These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by lower sales and marketing
expenses, which were primarily due to our curtailment of variable expenditures in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, including reduced marketing expenses and
employee travel expenses, in response to COVID-19.

Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total margin increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 due to the fiscal
2020 increases in revenues for this business, while total fiscal 2020 margins as a percentage of revenues remained flat.
Hardware Business
Our hardware business’ revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, server, storage, and industry-specific hardware offerings. The
hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a
combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware
product is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware
support contracts purchased by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered
over the contractual term, which is generally one year. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent
distributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our
hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal
manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of
inventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support
services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our
hardware offerings.

Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware revenues decreased in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 due to lower hardware products
revenues and lower hardware support revenues. The decreases in hardware products and hardware support revenues in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 were
primarily attributable to our continued emphasis on the marketing and sale of our cloud-based infrastructure technologies, which resulted in reduced sales
volumes of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of hardware support contracts sold in recent periods. Our hardware business’
revenues were also adversely impacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the economic effects caused by COVID-19. These unfavorable

impacts to our fiscal 2020 hardware revenues were partially offset by increased hardware revenues related to certain of our strategic hardware offerings, namely
our Oracle Exadata offerings.
Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware expenses decreased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower hardware
products expenses, lower hardware support costs, and lower sales and marketing expenses, all of which aligned to lower hardware revenues.
In constant currency, total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues for our hardware business increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019

Services Business
We offer services to customers and partners to help maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.
Services revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed. The cost of providing our services consists primarily of personnel related
expenses, technology infrastructure expenditures, facilities expenses and external contractor expenses.

Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total services revenues decreased in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 primarily due to declines in our
consulting services and education services revenues. Our services business revenues were also adversely impacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to
the impacts of COVID-19, including the impacts of consulting project delays due to customer resource constraints and jurisdictional restrictions imposed with
respect to in-person meetings. In addition, we incurred lower billable travel expenses and lower billable sub-contractor expenses for which we were to be
reimbursed by our customers, which reduced the amount of revenues and expenses we reported for this business during fiscal 2020.
In constant currency, total services expenses were flat in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 as lower expenses incurred for travel and sub-contractors as
described above and lower expenses related to the delivery of our education services were offset by higher employee related expenses associated with our
consulting offerings during fiscal 2020.
In constant currency, total margin and total margin as a percentage of total services revenues decreased during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 due to the
decrease in total revenues for this business.
Research and Development Expenses: research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures. We intend to continue to invest
significantly in our research and development efforts because, in our judgment, they are essential to maintaining our competitive position.

Amortization of Intangible Assets: Substantially all of our intangible assets were acquired through our business combinations. We amortize our intangible assets
over, and monitor the appropriateness of, the estimated useful lives of these assets. We also periodically review these intangible assets for potential impairment
based upon relevant facts and circumstances. Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report has additional

Acquisition Related and Other Expenses: Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other
employees, certain business combination adjustments including adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net.

On a constant currency basis, acquisition related and other expenses increased during fiscal 2020 due to higher other expenses, net including asset impairment

prospectively. In addition, during fiscal 2019 we recorded certain business combination related adjustments that benefited our expenses during this period.
These increases to our fiscal 2020 expenses growth were partially offset by lower fiscal 2020 transitional employee related costs.
Restructuring Expenses: restructuring expenses resulted from the execution of management approved restructuring plans that were generally developed to
improve our cost structure and/or operations, often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies. restructuring expenses consist of employee
severance costs and other contract termination costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. Prior to fiscal 2020, restructuring expenses also included
charges for duplicate facilities. For additional information regarding our restructuring plans, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included

periods due to the initiation of new restructuring plans or from changes in estimated costs associated with existing restructuring plans.
The majority of the initiatives undertaken by our 2019 restructuring Plan were effected to implement our continued emphasis in developing, marketing and
selling our cloud-based offerings. These initiatives impacted certain of our sales and marketing and research and development operations. Cost savings that are
expected to be realized pursuant to our 2019 restructuring Plan initiatives may be offset by investments in resources and geographies that best address the

Provision for Income Taxes: Our effective income tax rates for each of the periods presented were the result of the mix of income earned in various tax

report for a discussion regarding the differences between the effective income tax rates as presented for the periods below and the U.S. federal statutory
income tax rates that were in effect during these periods. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings weighted to
jurisdictions with higher tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, by adverse rulings in tax related litigation, or by shortfalls in stock-based
compensation realized by employees relative to stock-based compensation that was recorded for book purposes, among others.

Working capital: The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2020 in comparison to May 31, 2019 was primarily due to our issuance of $20.0 billion of long-
term senior notes in April 2020 (refer to recent Financing Activities below for additional information), the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting
from our net income during fiscal 2020 and cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These favorable working capital movements were partially offset by cash
used for repurchases of our common stock, the reclassification of $1.0 billion and €1.25 billion of long-term senior notes as current liabilities, cash used to pay
dividends to our stockholders during fiscal 2020, and the prospective recognition of current operating lease liabilities associated with our adoption of Topic 842
as of June 1, 2019. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are
variable.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper and
other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of corporate debt securities and certain other securities. The increase in
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2020 in comparison to May 31, 2019 was primarily due to our issuance of $20.0 billion of long-term
senior notes in April 2020, cash inflows generated by our operations and cash inflows from stock option exercises during fiscal 2020. These cash inflows were
partially offset by certain cash outflows, primarily $19.2 billion used for repurchases of our common stock, the repayment of $4.5 billion of borrowings, payments
of cash dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures.
The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of
the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in our consolidated
balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual report). As the
U.S. Dollar generally strengthened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2020, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries decreased on a net basis as of May 31, 2020 relative to what we would have reported using
constant currency rates from the May 31, 2019 balance sheet date.

Net cash provided by investing activities $ 9,843 -63% $ 26,557
Net cash used for financing activities $ (6,132) -85% $ (42,056)
Cash flows from operating activities: Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of
their license support agreements. Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’ terms,
which are generally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new licenses, cloud services,
hardware offerings and other services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing
costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes, interest payments and leased facilities.
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower net income and certain cash unfavorable
changes in the timing of payments received from customers during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which we believe were attributable to the unfavorable
global economic effects that resulted from COVID-19. We expect to collect substantially all of these delayed customer payments in future periods.
Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales of
our investments in marketable securities, and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth.

Net cash provided by investing activities decreased during fiscal 2020 primarily due to a fiscal 2020 decrease in proceeds from the maturities and sales of
marketable securities and other investments and a fiscal 2020 increase in the purchase of marketable securities and other investments, in each case relative to
fiscal 2019.
Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt
instruments, stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs.
Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2020 decreased compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a decrease in our stock repurchases for which we
used $19.2 billion in fiscal 2020 in comparison to $36.1 billion in fiscal 2019; and our fiscal 2020 issuance of $20.0 billion of senior notes (none in fiscal 2019).
Free cash flow: To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to
analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our
competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our
performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flow as follows:
Year Ended May 31,
(Dollars in millions) 2020 Change 2019
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 13,139 -10% $ 14,551
Capital expenditures (1,564) -6% (1,660)
Free cash flow $ 11,575 -10% $ 12,891
Net income $ 10,135 $ 11,083
Free cash flow as percent of net income 114% 116%
Long-Term Customer Financing: We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire licenses, cloud services, hardware and services offerings through
separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial
institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution. We generally record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as
sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. We financed $1.0 billion in each of fiscal
2020 and 2019 and $1.5 billion in fiscal 2018 or approximately 19%, 17% and 25%, respectively, of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues in fiscal
2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Recent Financing Activities:
Cash Dividends: In fiscal 2020, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.96 per share that totaled $3.1 billion. In June 2020, our Board of Directors declared a
quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 28, 2020 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July
15, 2020. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of
Directors.
Senior Notes: In April 2020, we issued $20.0 billion of senior notes comprised of the following:
• $3.50 billion of 2.50% senior notes due April 2025;
• $2.25 billion of 2.80% senior notes due April 2027;
• $3.25 billion of 2.95% senior notes due April 2030;
• $3.00 billion of 3.60% senior notes due April 2040;
• $4.50 billion of 3.60% senior notes due April 2050; and

• $3.50 billion of 3.85% senior notes due April 2060.
We issued the senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, repayment
of indebtedness and future acquisitions. Additionally, in fiscal 2020, we repaid $4.5 billion of senior notes pursuant to their terms. Additional details regarding
our senior notes are included in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report.
Common Stock Repurchase Program: Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On September 11, 2019
and March 12, 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program collectively totaling $30.0 billion. As of
May 31, 2020, approximately $16.6 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 361.0 million
shares for $19.2 billion, 733.8 million shares for $36.0 billion, and 238.0 million shares for $11.5 billion in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our stock
repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our
cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and
market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock
repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.
Contractual Obligations: The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under our fixed contractual
obligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual payments
differing from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most
significant assumptions used in preparing this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The
following is a summary of our material contractual obligations as of May 31, 2020:

(1) represents the principal balances and interest payments to be paid in connection with our senior notes and other borrowings outstanding as of May 31, 2020 after considering:
• certain interest rate swap agreements for certain series of senior notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with these senior notes so that they
effectively became variable pursuant to a LIBOr-based index. Interest payments on these senior notes have been presented in the table above after consideration of these fixed to variable
interest rate swap agreements based upon the interest rates applicable as of May 31, 2020 and are subject to change in future periods;
• certain cross-currency swap agreements for our €1.25 billion 2.25% senior notes due January 2021 that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, including
annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt with a fixed annual interest rate. Principal and interest payments for these
senior notes were calculated and presented in the table above based on the terms of these cross-currency swap agreements; and
• certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements for our €750 million 3.125% senior notes due July 2025 that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt,
including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a variable-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt. Principal and interest payments for these senior notes were
calculated and presented in the table above based on the terms of these cross-currency interest rate swap agreements as of May 31, 2020 and the interest payments are subject to change in
future periods.

(4) Primarily represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding; terms include: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price
provisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing of
finished hardware products. We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchase
commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for
the particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table. routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our
external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts presented above, as they are generally entered into in
order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way.
As of May 31, 2020, we had $8.4 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balance
sheet, and all such obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled or
released with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal
2021. We are involved in claims and legal proceedings. All such claims and obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to
the uncertainty of claims and legal proceedings and associated estimates and assumptions, all of which are inherently unpredictable and many aspects of which
are out of our control. Notes 14 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report includes additional information
regarding these contingencies.
We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital,
capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements. In addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and
repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional
borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on
our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are
material to investors.
Selected Quarterly Financial Data
The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, which
consisted only of normal recurring adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual report. The sum of the quarterly financial
information may vary from annual data due to rounding. refer to “Seasonality and Cyclicality” in Item 1 and “Business Overview” in Item 7 included elsewhere
within this Annual report for additional information regarding the seasonality of our revenues, expenses and margins and the impacts of COVID-19 on our
business during fiscal 2020.

Restricted Stock-Based Awards and Stock Options
Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees
and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders.
We recognize that restricted stock-based awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awards
granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2017 has been a
weighted-average annualized rate of 1.5% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stock-based awards
and stock options granted and assumed, net of restricted stock-based awards and stock options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the
weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stock-based awards vest and
stock options are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options at May 31, 2020, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, substantially all have exercise
prices lower than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of
our stock-based compensation program. However, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors, including
the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. As of May 31, 2020, the
maximum potential dilution from all outstanding restricted stock-based awards and unexercised stock options, regardless of when granted and regardless of
whether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higher than the market price as of such date, was 9.0%.
During fiscal 2020, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to
selected employees; all stock-based award grants to senior officers; and any individual grant of restricted stock units of 62,500 or greater. The annual
organization-wide stock-based award grants to selected employees are generally approved by the Compensation Committee during the ten business day period
following the second trading day after the announcement of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings report. However, we currently do not expect that the annual grant
for fiscal 2021 will be approved during this time period. Each member of a separate executive officer committee, referred to as the Plan Committee, was
allocated a fiscal 2020 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal year to grant equity within his or her organization, subject to certain limitations
established by the Compensation Committee.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, if
any, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report.
Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Cash, Cash Equivalents, Marketable Securities and Interest Income Risk
Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $43.1 billion and $37.8 billion as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our bank deposits and time
deposits are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investment-grade credit ratings or financial institutions that meet
investment-grade ratings criteria, which we believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks. In addition, as of May 31, 2020, substantially all of our
marketable securities were high quality with substantially all having maturity dates within one year (a description of our marketable securities held is included in
Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report and “Liquidity and Capital resources” above). We held a
mix of both fixed and floating-rate debt securities. Fixed rate securities may have their market values adversely impacted as interest rates increase, while floating
rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may vary due to changes
in interest rates or we may realize losses if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we
classify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to
maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. The fair values of our fixed-rate debt securities are impacted by interest rate
movements and if interest rates would have been higher by 50 basis points as of each of May 31, 2020 and 2019 we estimate the change would have decreased
the fair values of our marketable securities holdings by $15 million and $128 million, respectively. We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes.
Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For fiscal
2020 and 2019, total interest income was $527 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, with our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities investments
yielding an average 1.47% and 2.08%, respectively, on a worldwide basis.

Income Taxes
We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences of
temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes. We
record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.
A two-step approach is applied pursuant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit,
including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50%
likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our
consolidated statements of operations.
A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as a part of a business combination is
provided under “Business Combinations” above.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Financial Instruments: In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on
Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04). ASU 2020-04 provides optional guidance for contract modifications and certain hedging relationships associated with the
transition from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. ASU 2020-04 is effective for all entities upon issuance through December 31, 2022. We are
still evaluating the impact, but do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, Investments—Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) (ASU 2020-01). ASU 2020-01 clarifies the interaction of the accounting for equity securities under Topic 321, the accounting
for equity method investments in Topic 323, and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options in Topic 815. ASU 2020-01 is effective for us
in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, and earlier adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2020-01 on our
consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-
13) and also issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance (collectively, Topic 326). Topic 326 requires measurement and recognition of expected credit
losses for financial assets held. We will adopt Topic 326 effective June 1, 2020 with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded as an adjustment to accumulated
deficit. We currently do not expect that our pending adoption of Topic 326 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes: In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12), which is
intended to simplify various areas related to the accounting for income taxes and improve consistent application of Topic 740. ASU 2019-12 is effective for us
beginning in fiscal 2022, and earlier adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2019-12 on our consolidated
financial statements.
2. ACQUISITIONS
Fiscal 2018 Acquisition of Aconex Limited
On March 28, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Aconex Limited (Aconex), a provider of cloud-based collaboration software for construction projects. We

consolidated financial statements. The total purchase price for Aconex was approximately $1.2 billion, which consisted of approximately $1.2 billion in cash and
$7 million for the fair values of stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed. In allocating the purchase price based on estimated fair values, we
recorded approximately $873 million of goodwill, $377 million of identifiable intangible assets, and $29 million of net liabilities. Goodwill generated from our
acquisition of Aconex was primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition and is tax deductible.
Other Fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 Acquisitions
During fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, we acquired certain other companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our
products and services offerings. These acquisitions were not significant individually or in the aggregate to our consolidated financial statements.
3. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES
Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, money market funds and other securities
with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain other
securities.
The amortized principal amounts of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated their fair values at May 31, 2020 and 2019. We use the
specific identification method to determine any realized gains or losses from the sale of our marketable securities classified as available-for-sale. Such realized
gains and losses were insignificant for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018. The following table summarizes the components of our cash equivalents and marketable
securities held, substantially all of which were classified as available-for-sale:
May 31,
(in millions) 2020 2019
Corporate debt securities and other $ 6,625 $ 22,242
Commercial paper debt securities 5,640 —
Money market funds 18,587 5,700
Total investments $ 30,852 $ 27,942
Investments classified as cash equivalents $ 25,034 $ 10,629
Investments classified as marketable securities $ 5,818 $ 17,313
As of May 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 99% and 33%, respectively, of our marketable securities investments mature within one year and 1% and 67%,
respectively, mature within one to four years. Our investment portfolio is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. As described above, we limit
purchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities, which have high credit ratings and also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one
issuer. As stated in our investment policy, we are averse to principal loss and seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.
restricted cash that was included within cash and cash equivalents as presented within our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2020 and 2019 and our
consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended May 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was nominal.

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
We perform fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets
and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider
assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.
ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when
measuring fair value. An asset’s or a liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
• Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2: inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or
liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be
corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or
• Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following (Level 1 and Level 2 inputs are defined above):

Our marketable securities investments consist of Tier 1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain other securities. Marketable
securities as presented per our consolidated balance sheets included securities with original maturities at the time of purchase greater than three months and
the remainder of the securities were included in cash and cash equivalents. Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of our instruments that
were classified as Level 1 in the table above were derived from quoted market prices and active markets for these instruments that exist. Our valuation
techniques used to measure the fair values of Level 2 instruments listed in the table above, the counterparties to which have high credit ratings, were derived
from the following: non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated by observable market data, quoted market prices for similar instruments, or
pricing models, such as discounted cash flow techniques,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
May 31, 2020
(1) We entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effects of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with the 2.25% senior notes that were due and were settled
in October 2019 (October 2019 Notes) and the 2.80% senior notes due July 2021 (July 2021 Notes) so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable based on LIBOr. The effective
interest rates after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements were 3.07% as of May 31, 2019 for the October 2019 Notes, and 1.99% and 3.22%, respectively, for the July
2021 Notes as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. refer to Notes 1 and 10 for a description of our accounting for fair value hedges associated with our July 2021 Notes and to our Annual report for
the year ended May 31, 2019 for a description of our accounting for fair value hedges associated with our October 2019 Notes.
(2) In July 2013, we issued €2.0 billion of fixed-rate senior notes comprised of €1.25 billion of 2.25% senior notes due January 2021 (January 2021 Notes) and €750 million of 3.125% senior notes due July
2025 (July 2025 Notes, and together with the January 2021 Notes, the Euro Notes). Principal and unamortized discount/issuance costs for the Euro Notes in the table above were calculated using foreign
currency exchange rates as of May 31, 2020 and May 31, 2019, respectively. The Euro Notes are registered and trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
(3) In connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt,
including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt of $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest rate of 3.53% (see Note 10 for
additional information).
(4) In fiscal 2018 we entered into certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, including annual interest
payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a variable-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt of $871 million based on LIBOr. The effective interest rates as of May 31, 2020 and 2019 after
consideration of the cross-currency interest rate swap agreements were 4.46% and 5.74%, respectively, for the July 2025 Notes. refer to Notes 1 and 10 for a description of our accounting for fair value
hedges.
(5) In April 2020, we issued $20.0 billion of senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and repayment of
indebtedness and future acquisitions. The interest is payable semi-annually. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes of each series prior to their maturity, subject to certain restrictions, and the
payment of an applicable make-whole premium in certain instances.
Future principal payments (adjusted for the effects of the cross-currency swap agreements associated with the January 2021 Notes and July 2025 Notes) for all of
our borrowings at May 31, 2020 were as follows (in millions):
Fiscal 2021 $ 2,631
Fiscal 2022 8,250
Fiscal 2023 3,750
Fiscal 2024 3,500
Fiscal 2025 10,000
Thereafter 43,984
Total $ 72,115
Senior Notes
Interest is payable semi-annually for the senior notes listed in the above table except for the Euro Notes for which interest is payable annually. We may redeem
some or all of the senior notes of each series prior to their maturity, subject to certain restrictions, and the payment of an applicable make-whole premium in
certain instances.
The senior notes rank pari passu with any other notes we may issue in the future pursuant to our commercial paper program (see additional discussion regarding
our commercial paper program below) and all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness of Oracle Corporation. All existing and future liabilities of the
subsidiaries of Oracle Corporation are or will be effectively senior to the senior notes and any future issuances of commercial paper notes. We were in
compliance with all debt-related covenants at May 31, 2020.

Commercial Paper Program and Commercial Paper Notes
Our existing $3.0 billion commercial paper program allows us to issue and sell unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a private placement
exemption from the registration requirements under federal and state securities laws pursuant to dealer agreements with various banks and an Issuing and

8. RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES
Fiscal 2019 Oracle Restructuring Plan
During fiscal 2019, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations due to our
acquisitions and certain other operational activities (2019 restructuring Plan). restructuring costs associated with the 2019 restructuring Plan were recorded to
the restructuring expense line item within our consolidated statements of operations as they were incurred. We recorded $261 million and $476 million of
restructuring expenses in connection with the 2019 restructuring Plan in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect to incur the majority of the estimated
remaining $105 million of restructuring expenses in fiscal 2021. Any changes to the estimates or timing of executing the 2019 restructuring Plan will be reflected
in our future results of operations.
Fiscal 2017 Oracle Restructuring Plan
During fiscal 2017, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations due to our
acquisitions and certain other operational activities (2017 restructuring Plan). restructuring costs associated with the 2017 restructuring Plan were recorded to
the restructuring expense line item within our consolidated statements of operations as they were incurred. We recorded $601 million of restructuring expenses
in connection with the 2017 restructuring Plan in fiscal 2018. Actions pursuant to the 2017 restructuring Plan were substantially complete as of May 31, 2018.

9. DEFERRED REVENUES
Deferred revenues consisted of the following:
May 31,
(in millions) 2020 2019
Cloud services and license support $ 6,996 $ 7,340
Hardware 613 635
Services 365 360
Cloud license and on-premise license 28 39
Deferred revenues, current 8,002 8,374
Deferred revenues, non-current (in other non-current liabilities) 597 669
Total deferred revenues $ 8,599 $ 9,043
Deferred cloud services and license support revenues and deferred hardware revenues substantially represent customer payments made in advance for cloud or
support contracts that are typically billed in advance with corresponding revenues generally being recognized ratably over the contractual periods. Deferred
services revenues include prepayments for our services business and revenues for these services are generally recognized as the services are performed.
Deferred cloud license and on-premise license revenues typically resulted from customer payments that related to undelivered products and services or specified
enhancements.
In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support performance obligations assumed from our
acquired companies. We generally have estimated the fair values of these obligations assumed using a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approach
determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The sum of the costs and operating profit
approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume these acquired obligations. These aforementioned fair value
adjustments recorded for obligations assumed from our acquisitions reduced the cloud services and license support deferred revenues balances that we
recorded as liabilities from these acquisitions and also reduced the resulting revenues that we recognized or will recognize over the terms of the acquired
obligations during the post-combination periods. refer to Note 15 for additional information.
10. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Fair Value Hedges—Interest Rate Swap Agreements and Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swap Agreements
In May 2018, we entered into certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our July
2025 Notes by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated 2025 Notes, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal at
maturity, to variable-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt based on LIBOr. In July 2014, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the
economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our July 2021 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectively
became variable based on LIBOr. The critical terms of the swap agreements match the critical terms of the July 2025 Notes and July 2021 Notes that the swap
agreements pertain to, including the notional amounts and maturity dates.
We have designated the aforementioned swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC
815. The changes in fair values of the cross-currency interest rate swap agreements associated with our July 2025 Notes are recognized as interest expense and
non-operating income, net in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in non-current assets or non-current liabilities
in our consolidated balance sheets.

The changes in fair values of our interest rate swap agreements associated with our July 2021 Notes are recognized as interest expense in our consolidated
statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in other non-current assets or other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance
sheets. The amount of net gain (loss) attributable to the interest rate risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense and amount of net gain (loss)
attributable to the foreign exchange risk being hedged, as applicable, is recognized as non-operating income, net in our consolidated statements of operations
with the corresponding amount included in notes payable, current or notes payable, non-current. We exclude the portion of the change in fair value of cross-
currency interest rate swap agreements attributable to the related cross-currency basis spread in our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The change in fair value
of these cross-currency interest rate swap agreements attributable to the cross-currency basis spread is included in AOCL. The periodic interest settlements for
the swap agreements for the July 2025 Notes and July 2021 Notes are recorded as interest expense and are included as a part of cash flows from operating
activities and, for the swap agreements associated with the July 2025 Notes, the cash flows that pertain to the principal balance are classified as financing
activities.
Cash Flow Hedges—Cross-Currency Swap Agreements
In connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currency
exchange risk by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro-denominated January 2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments and the payment of
principal at maturity, to fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt. The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cash
flows in U.S. Dollars associated with the January 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the January 2021 Notes at $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interest
rate of 3.53%. We have designated these cross-currency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedges
pursuant to ASC 815. The critical terms of the cross-currency swap agreements correspond to the January 2021 Notes including the annual interest payments
being hedged, and the cross-currency swap agreements mature at the same time as the January 2021 Notes.
We used the hypothetical derivative method to assess the effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements. The fair values of these cross-currency swap
agreements are recognized as other current assets or other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. We reflect the gains or losses on the effective
portion of these cross-currency swap agreements in AOCL in our consolidated balance sheets and an amount is reclassified out of AOCL into non-operating
income, net in the same period that the carrying values of the Euro-denominated January 2021 Notes are remeasured and the interest expense is recognized.
The cash flows related to the cross-currency swap agreements that pertain to the periodic interest settlements are classified as operating activities and the cash
flows that pertain to the principal balance are classified as financing activities.
Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as Hedges
We transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks
associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so that
increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks and
volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from
intercompany sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are generally expected to be cash settled in the near term. Our
foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally
depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those
rates, the net realized and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.

We do not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we recorded the fair values of these contracts as of the
end of each reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. The balance
sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other current
liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is
non-operating income, net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses.
As of May 31, 2020 and 2019, the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international
currencies were $4.2 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major
international currencies were $3.9 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at
May 31, 2020 and 2019. The cash flows related to these foreign currency contracts are classified as operating activities.
The effects of derivative instruments designated as hedges on certain of our consolidated financial statements were as follows as of or for each of the respective

11. LEASES, OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CERTAIN CONTINGENCIES
Leases
We have operating leases that primarily relate to certain of our facilities, data centers and vehicles. As of May 31, 2020, our operating leases substantially have
remaining terms of one year to twelve years, some of which include options to extend and/or terminate the leases.
For fiscal 2020, operating lease expenses totaled $599 million, net of sublease income of $16 million. At May 31, 2020, rOU assets, current lease liabilities and
non-current lease liabilities for our operating leases were $2.0 billion, $575 million and $1.5 billion, respectively. We recorded rOU assets of $2.8 billion in
exchange for operating lease obligations during the year ended May 31, 2020, which included $1.9 billion for operating leases existing on June 1, 2019 that were
recognized upon our initial adoption of Topic 842 and $849 million for operating leases that were contracted during fiscal 2020. Cash paid for amounts included
in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $663 million for year ended May 31, 2020. As of May 31, 2020, the weighted average remaining lease term
for operating leases was approximately six years and the weighted average discount rate used for calculating operating lease obligations was 3.2%. As of May 31,
2020, we have $411 million of additional operating lease commitments, primarily for data centers, that commence in fiscal 2021 for terms of one to ten years
that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2020 or in the maturities table below.

Unconditional Obligations
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers, which are agreements that are enforceable and
legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate
timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and
testing of finished hardware products. We also obtain individual components for our hardware products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected
demand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment
within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amounts disclosed
below. routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered
into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts below, as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated
terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way.
As of May 31, 2020, our unconditional purchase and certain other obligations were as follows (in millions):
Fiscal 2021 $ 881

As described in Notes 7 and 10 above, as of May 31, 2020 we have senior notes and other borrowings that mature at various future dates and derivative financial
instruments outstanding that we leverage to manage certain risks and exposures.
Guarantees
Our cloud, license and hardware sales agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our products infringe a
third party’s intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any material
liabilities related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our sales agreements also include provisions

indemnifying customers against liabilities in the event we breach confidentiality or service level requirements. It is not possible to determine the maximum
potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to our limited and infrequent history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and
circumstances involved in each particular agreement.
Our Oracle Cloud Services agreements generally include a warranty that the cloud services will be performed in all material respects as defined in the agreement
during the service period. Our license and hardware agreements also generally include a warranty that our products will substantially operate as described in the
applicable program documentation for a period of one year after delivery. We also warrant that services we perform will be provided in a manner consistent with
industry standards for a period of 90 days from performance of the services.
We occasionally are required, for various reasons, to enter into financial guarantees with third parties in the ordinary course of our business including, among
others, guarantees related to taxes, import licenses and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Such agreements have not had a
material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
In connection with certain litigation, we posted certain court-mandated surety bonds with a court and entered into related indemnification agreements with
each of the surety bond issuing companies. Additional information is provided in Note 17 below.
12. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Common Stock Repurchases
Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On September 11, 2019 and March 12, 2020, we announced
that our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program collectively totaling $30.0 billion. As of May 31, 2020, approximately $16.6
billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 361.0 million shares for $19.2 billion, 733.8 million
shares for $36.0 billion, and 238.0 million shares for $11.5 billion in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, under the stock repurchase program.
Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital
needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic
and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock
repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.
Dividends on Common Stock
During fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $0.96, $0.81 and $0.76 per share of our outstanding common stock,
respectively, which we paid during the same period.
In June 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share of our outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on July 28,
2020 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 15, 2020. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment
dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.

13. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Stock-Based Compensation Plans
Stock Plans
In fiscal 2001, we adopted the 2000 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan, which provides for the issuance of long-term performance awards, including restricted
stock-based awards, non-qualified stock options and incentive stock options, as well as stock purchase rights and stock appreciation rights, to our eligible
employees, officers and directors who are also employees or consultants, independent consultants and advisers.
• In fiscal 2011, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of our Board of Directors (the Board), approved the adoption of the Amended and
restated 2000 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan), which extended the termination date of the 2000 Plan by 10 years and increased the
number of authorized shares of stock that may be issued by 388,313,015 shares.
• In fiscal 2014, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of the Board, approved a further increase in the number of authorized shares of stock
that may be issued under the 2000 Plan by 305,000,000 shares. Under the terms of the 2000 Plan, long-term full value awards are granted in the
form of restricted stock units (rSUs) and performance-based restricted stock awards (PSUs). For each share granted as a full value award under the
2000 Plan, an equivalent of 2.5 shares is deducted from our pool of shares available for grant.
• In fiscal 2018, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of the Board, approved a further increase in the number of authorized shares of stock
that may be issued under the 2000 Plan by 330,000,000 shares, and approved material terms of the performance goals under which PSUs and
performance-based stock options (PSOs) could be granted.
As of May 31, 2020, the 2000 Plan had 97 million unvested rSUs outstanding, 54 million PSOs outstanding and service-based stock options (SOs) to purchase 120
million shares of common stock outstanding of which 112 million shares were vested. As of May 31, 2020, approximately 212 million shares of common stock
were available for future awards under the 2000 Plan. To date, we have not issued any stock purchase rights or stock appreciation rights under the 2000 Plan.
The 2000 Plan is scheduled to expire on the date of Oracle’s annual meeting of stockholders in November 2020.
The vesting schedule for all awards granted under the 2000 Plan is established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. rSUs generally require
service-based vesting of 25% annually over four years. The vesting schedule for PSUs currently requires achieving performance targets and providing service over
four fiscal years. SOs are granted at not less than fair market value, become exercisable generally 25% annually over four years of service, and generally expire 10
years from the date of grant. PSOs granted to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer in fiscal 2018 consist of seven numerically equivalent
vesting tranches that potentially may

vest. One tranche vests solely on the attainment of a market-based metric. The remaining six tranches require the attainment of both a performance metric and
a market capitalization metric. In each case, the market-based metric, performance metrics and market capitalization metrics for the PSOs may be achieved at
any time during a five year performance period, assuming continued employment and service through the date the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors certifies that performance has been achieved. The PSOs have contractual lives of eight years in comparison to the typical ten year contractual lives for
SOs. For the six tranches of the PSOs with both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense is to be recognized once each vesting
tranche becomes probable of achievement over the longer of the estimated implicit service period or derived service. Stock-based compensation associated with
a vesting tranche where vesting is no longer determined to be probable is reversed on a cumulative basis and is no longer prospectively recognized in the period
when such a determination is made. We have preliminarily estimated service periods for those tranches that have been deemed probable of achievement to be
up to five years. Stock-based compensation for the market-based tranche will be recognized using the derived service period for the market-based metric
achievement, which we have initially estimated to be approximately three years.
In fiscal 1993, the Board adopted the 1993 Directors’ Stock Plan (the Directors’ Plan), which provides for the issuance of rSUs and other stock-based awards,
including non-qualified stock options, to non-employee directors. The Directors’ Plan has from time to time been amended and restated. Under the terms of the
Directors’ Plan, 10 million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance (including a fiscal 2013 amendment to increase the number of shares of our
common stock reserved for issuance by 2 million shares). In prior years, we granted stock options at not less than fair market value, that vest over four years, and
expire no more than 10 years from the date of grant. We currently grant rSUs only that vest fully on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant. The Directors’
Plan was most recently amended on April 29, 2016 and permits the Compensation Committee of the Board to determine the amount and form of automatic
grants of stock awards, if any, to each non-employee director upon first becoming a director and thereafter on an annual basis, as well as automatic grants for
chairing certain Board committees, subject to certain stockholder approved limitations set forth in the Directors’ Plan. In April 2020, the Compensation
Committee reduced the maximum value of the annual automatic rSU grants to each non-employee director from $400,000 to $350,000 and eliminated all equity
grants for chairing board committees. As of May 31, 2020, approximately 81,000 unvested rSUs and stock options to purchase approximately 1 million shares of
common stock (all of which were vested) were outstanding under the Directors’ Plan. As of May 31, 2020, approximately 1 million shares were available for
future stock awards under this plan.
In connection with certain of our acquisitions, we assumed certain outstanding restricted stock-based awards and stock options under each acquired company’s
respective stock plans, or we substituted substantially similar awards under the 2000 Plan. These restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed or
substituted generally retain all of the rights, terms and conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally granted. As of May 31, 2020, stock
options to purchase approximately 1 million shares of common stock were outstanding under acquired company stock plans that Oracle assumed.

The total grant date fair value of restricted stock-based awards that were vested and issued in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $1.5 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.0
billion, respectively. As of May 31, 2020, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock-based awards was $3.2
billion and is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 2.72 years.
No PSUs were granted in fiscal 2020, 2019 or 2018. In fiscal 2017, PSUs were granted that vest upon the attainment of certain performance metrics and service-
based vesting. In fiscal 2020, 1.1 million PSUs vested and were issued and 0.3 million PSUs remained outstanding as of May 31, 2020.

Total 127 $ 34.20 2.97 $ 2,491
(1) The aggregate intrinsic value was calculated based on the gross difference between our closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal 2020 of $53.77 and the exercise prices for all “in-the-money”
options outstanding, excluding tax effects.
(2) The unrecognized compensation expense calculated under the fair value method for shares expected to vest (unvested shares net of expected forfeitures) as of May 31, 2020 was approximately $64
million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.94 years. Approximately 49 million shares outstanding as of May 31, 2020 were not expected to vest.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense and Valuations of Stock Awards
We estimated the fair values of our restricted stock-based awards that are solely subject to service-based vesting requirements based upon their market values
as of the grant dates, discounted for the present values of expected dividends.
Stock-based compensation expense was included in the following operating expense line items in our consolidated statements of operations:

Tax Benefits from Exercises of Stock Options and Vesting of Restricted Stock-Based Awards
Total cash received as a result of option exercises was approximately $1.5 billion, $2.0 billion and $2.3 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The
total aggregate intrinsic value of restricted stock-based awards that vested and were issued and stock options that were exercised was $2.9 billion, $3.1 billion
and $3.0 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In connection with the vesting and issuance of restricted stock-based awards and stock options that
were exercised, the tax benefits realized by us were $638 million, $692 million and $860 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan) that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 95% of the fair
market value of Oracle stock as of the end of the semi-annual option period. As of May 31, 2020, 44 million shares were reserved for future issuances under the
Purchase Plan. We issued 2 million shares in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, and 3 million shares in fiscal 2018 under the Purchase Plan.
Defined Contribution and Other Postretirement Plans
We offer various defined contribution plans for our U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution plan expense was $376 million, $380 million and
$384 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
In the U.S., regular employees can participate in the Oracle Corporation 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan (Oracle 401(k) Plan). Participants can generally
contribute up to 40% of their eligible compensation on a per-pay-period basis as defined by the Oracle 401(k) Plan document or by the section 402(g) limit as
defined by the U.S. Internal revenue Service (IrS). We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 50% up to 6% of compensation each pay period,
subject to maximum aggregate matching amounts. Our contributions to the Oracle 401(k) Plan, net of forfeitures, were $152 million, $154 million and $151
million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
We also offer non-qualified deferred compensation plans to certain employees whereby they may defer a portion of their annual base and/or variable
compensation until retirement or a date specified by the employee in accordance with the plans. Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities were each
approximately $636 million and approximately $566 million as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and were presented in other non-current assets and other
non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

We sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans that are offered primarily by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans were assumed through
our acquisitions or are required by local regulatory requirements. We may deposit funds for these plans with insurance companies, third-party trustees, or into
government-managed accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as applicable. Our total defined benefit plan pension expenses were $97 million,
$90 million and $102 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate net liability (funded status) of
our defined benefit plans as of May 31, 2020 were $1.3 billion and $884 million, respectively, and as of May 31, 2019 were $1.2 billion and $821 million,
respectively.
14. INCOME TAXES
Our effective tax rates for each of the periods presented are the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income
tax rates. Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2020 varied from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to earnings in
foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the
Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction and the tax effect of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). During fiscal 2019, we recorded a net benefit of
$389 million in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) related to adjustments in our estimates of the one-time transition tax on certain
foreign subsidiary earnings, and the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets and liabilities affected by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act).
Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2019 varied from the 21% U.S. statutory rate imposed by the Tax Act primarily due to earnings in foreign operations,
state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the Foreign Derived
Intangible Income deduction, GILTI, and the aforementioned $389 million net reduction to our transition tax recorded consistent with the provision of SAB 118.
Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2018 varied from the 21% U.S. statutory rate imposed by the Tax Act primarily due to the impacts of the Tax Act upon
our adoption date of January 1, 2018 including the impacts of the transition tax, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax
authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction.
The following is a geographical breakdown of income before the provision for income taxes:

We provide for taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We do not provide for taxes on other outside basis temporary differences of foreign
subsidiaries as they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. At May 31, 2020, the amount of temporary differences related to other outside basis
temporary differences of investments in foreign subsidiaries upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided was approximately $7.9 billion. If the other
outside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associated
with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. At May 31, 2020, assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred
tax liability associated with these other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately $1.5 billion.
Our net deferred tax assets were $3.2 billion and $2.4 billion as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We believe that it is more likely than not that the net
deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable
income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax
credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income
change.

The valuation allowance was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A majority of the valuation allowances as of May 31, 2020
and 2019 related to tax assets established in purchase accounting and other tax credits. Any subsequent reduction of that portion of the valuation allowance and
the recognition of the associated tax benefits associated with our acquisitions will be recorded to our provision for income taxes subsequent to our final
determination of the valuation allowance or the conclusion of the measurement period (as defined above), whichever comes first.
At May 31, 2020, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $597 million, which are subject to limitation on their utilization.
Approximately $537 million of these federal net operating losses expire in various years between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2038. Approximately $60 million of these
federal net operating losses are not currently subject to expiration dates. We had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.0 billion at May 31,
2020, which expire between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2038 and are subject to limitations on their utilization. We had total foreign net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $1.9 billion at May 31, 2020, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $1.7 billion of these foreign net operating losses
are not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the foreign net operating losses, approximately $133 million, expire between fiscal 2021 and fiscal
2040. We had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1.1 billion at May 31, 2020, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $741
million of these tax credit carryforwards are not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the tax credit carryforwards, approximately $357 million,
expire in various years between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2038.
We classify our unrecognized tax benefits as either current or non-current income taxes payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The
aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits, including acquisitions, were as follows:
Year Ended May 31,
(in millions) 2020 2019 2018
Gross unrecognized tax benefits as of June 1 $ 6,348 $ 5,592 $ 4,919
Increases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years 624 772 200
Decreases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years (298) (135) (65)
Increases related to tax positions taken during current fiscal year 628 540 840
Settlements with tax authorities (177) (153) (42)
Lapses of statutes of limitation (116) (202) (273)
Cumulative translation adjustments and other, net (37) (66) 13
Total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of May 31 $ 6,972 $ 6,348 $ 5,592
As of May 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, $4.3 billion, $4.2 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits would affect our effective tax rate if
recognized. We recognized interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements of
operations of $202 million, $312 million and $127 million during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of May 31, 2020 and
2019 were $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.
Domestically, U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal
2017. Many issues are at an advanced stage in the examination process, the most significant of which include the deductibility of certain royalty payments,
transfer pricing, extraterritorial income exemptions, domestic production activity, foreign tax credits, and research and development credits taken. With all of
these domestic audit issues considered in the aggregate, we believe that it was reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2020, the gross unrecognized tax benefits
related to these audits could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $1.1 billion ($1.0 billion net
of offsetting tax benefits). Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2010 and we are no longer subject to audit for
those periods. Our U.S. state income tax returns, with

some exceptions, have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2007 and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods.
Internationally, tax authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining returns affecting our unrecognized tax benefits. We believe that it was
reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2020, the gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) by as
much as $105 million ($42 million net of offsetting tax benefits) in the next 12 months related primarily to transfer pricing. With some exceptions, we are
generally no longer subject to tax examinations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 2001.
We believe that we have adequately provided under GAAP for outcomes related to our tax audits. However, there can be no assurances as to the possible
outcomes or any related financial statement effect thereof. On June 22, 2020 the U.S. Supreme Court declined a Writ of Certiorari in the case of Altera Corp vs
Commissioner challenging a decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (which itself reversed a previous decision of the U.S. Tax Court) holding that the U.S.
Treasury Department’s regulations requiring the inclusion of stock-based compensation expense in a taxpayer’s cost-sharing calculations were valid. Our
consolidated financial statements have been prepared consistent with this outcome, and accordingly no adjustments will be required as the result of this
development.
We are under audit by the IrS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved in
various challenges and litigation in a number of countries, including, in particular, Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, Israel, South Korea, Mexico,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Spain, where the amounts under controversy are significant. In some, although not all cases, we have reserved for potential
adjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax
authorities or final outcomes in judicial proceedings, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings will not
have a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would
result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income
tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, it could result in a further charge to expense.

15. SEGMENT INFORMATION
ASC 280, Segment Reporting, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an
enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in
deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision makers (CODMs) are our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Technology Officer. We are organized by line of business and geographically. While our CODMs evaluate results in a number of different ways, the line of
business management structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed. The tabular information below
presents the financial information provided to our CODMs for their review and assists our CODMs with evaluating the company’s performance and allocating
company resources.
We have three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—each of which is comprised of a single operating segment. All three of our businesses
market and sell our offerings globally to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers with a worldwide sales force
positioned to offer the combinations that best meet customer needs.
Our cloud and license business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our applications and infrastructure technologies through cloud and on-premise
deployment models including our cloud services and license support offerings; and our cloud license and on-premise license offerings. Cloud services and license
support revenues are generated from offerings that are typically contracted with customers directly, billed to customers in advance, delivered to customers over
time with our revenue recognition occurring over the contractual terms, and renewed by customers upon completion of the contractual terms. Cloud services
and license support contracts provide customers with access to the latest updates to the applications and infrastructure technologies as they become available
and for which the customer contracted and also include related technical support services over the contractual term. Cloud license and on-premise license
revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications
software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments. We generally recognize revenues at the point in time the software is made available to the
customer to download and use, which typically is immediate upon signature of the license contract. In each fiscal year, our cloud and license business’
contractual activities are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and the related cash flows are typically highest in the following quarter (i.e., in the first fiscal
quarter of the next fiscal year) as we receive payments from these contracts.
Our hardware business provides Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware, operating systems, virtualization, management and
other hardware-related software to support diverse IT environments. Our hardware business also offers hardware support, which provides customers with
software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of their hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain other
software, and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services.
Our services business provides services to customers and partners to help maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and
infrastructure technologies.
We do not track our assets for each business. Consequently, it is not practical to show assets by operating segment.

Disaggregation of Revenues
We have considered information that is regularly reviewed by our CODMs in evaluating financial performance, and disclosures presented outside of our financial
statements in our earnings releases and used in investor presentations to disaggregate revenues to depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of
revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The principal category we use to disaggregate revenues is the nature of our products and services as
presented in our consolidated statements of operations, the total of which is reconciled to revenues from our reportable segments as per the preceding tables of
this footnote.
The following table is a summary of our total revenues by geographic region. The relative proportion of our total revenues between each geographic region as
presented in the table below was materially consistent across each of our operating segments’ revenues for each of fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018:

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted‑average number of common shares outstanding during the period,
plus the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock-based awards, stock options, and shares issuable under the employee stock purchase plan as applicable
pursuant to the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

17. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Hewlett-Packard Company Litigation
On June 15, 2011, Hewlett-Packard Company, now Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HP), filed a complaint in the California Superior Court, County of Santa
Clara against Oracle Corporation alleging numerous causes of action including breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,
defamation, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and violation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act. The complaint alleged
that when Oracle announced on March 22 and 23, 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HP’s Itanium-based servers, it
breached a settlement agreement signed on September 20, 2010 (the HP Settlement Agreement), resolving litigation between HP and one of Oracle’s former
CEOs who had previously acted as HP’s chief executive officer and chairman of HP’s board of directors. HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties’ rights and
obligations under the HP Settlement Agreement and other equitable and monetary relief. Oracle answered the complaint and filed cross-claims.
After a bench trial on the meaning of the HP Settlement Agreement, the court found that the HP Settlement Agreement required Oracle to continue to develop
certain of its software products for use on HP’s Itanium-based servers at no cost to HP. The case proceeded to a jury trial in May 2016. On June 30, 2016, the jury
returned a verdict in favor of HP on its claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and against Oracle on its
cross-claims. The jury awarded HP $3.0 billion in damages. Under the court’s rulings, HP is entitled to post-judgment interest, but not pre-judgment interest, on
this award.
After the trial court denied Oracle’s motion for a new trial, Oracle filed a notice of appeal on January 17, 2017. On February 2, 2017, HP filed a notice of appeal of
the trial court’s denial of pre-judgment interest.
Oracle has posted a mandated surety bond with the trial court for the amounts owing. No amounts have been paid or recorded to our results of operations. We
continue to believe that we have meritorious defenses against HP’s claims, and we intend to present these defenses to the appellate court. Oracle filed its
opening brief on March 7, 2019. Briefing on the appeal was completed November 1, 2019, and the appellate court has not scheduled a date for oral argument.
We cannot currently estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for this action due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the appeal process and the
nature of the claims. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of the appeal process related to this action is uncertain. It is possible that the
resolution of this action could have a material impact on our future cash flows and results of operations.
Derivative Litigation Concerning Oracle’s NetSuite Acquisition
On May 3 and July 18, 2017, two alleged stockholders filed separate derivative lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, purportedly on
Oracle’s behalf. Thereafter, the court consolidated the two derivative cases and designated the July 18, 2017 complaint as the operative complaint. The
consolidated lawsuit was brought against all the then-current members and one former member of our Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant.
Plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite) at an excessive price. Plaintiff
seeks declaratory relief, unspecified monetary damages (including interest), and attorneys’ fees and costs. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which the
court denied on March 19, 2018.
On May 4, 2018, the Board of Directors established a Special Litigation Committee (the SLC) to investigate the allegations in this derivative action. Three non-
employee directors served on the SLC. On August 15, 2019, the SLC filed a letter with the court, stating that the SLC believed that plaintiff should be allowed to
proceed with the derivative litigation on behalf of Oracle. After the SLC advised the Board that it had fulfilled its duties and obligations, the Board withdrew the
SLC’s authority, except that the SLC maintained certain authority to respond to discovery requests in the litigation.

After plaintiff filed its initial complaint, plaintiff filed several amended complaints. Plaintiff filed its most recent amended complaint on February 18, 2020. The
complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty against our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Technology Officer, the estate of Mark Hurd (our former Chief
Executive Officer who passed away on October 18, 2019), and two other members of our Board of Directors. Oracle is named as a nominal defendant. The
complaint also asserts an aiding-and-abetting claim against NetSuite’s former Chief Executive Officer and NetSuite’s former Chief Technology Officer. The two
former NetSuite officers moved to dismiss the complaint, and the court held a hearing on that motion on March 11, 2020. The court has not yet ruled on that
motion. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer answered the latest complaint on March 3, 2020, and Oracle filed an answer on the same day.
On February 20, 2020, the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss. No hearing has been scheduled for this motion.
On April 20, 2020, after our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer indicated that they might challenge plaintiff’s standing to pursue this matter, an
additional plaintiff moved to intervene in this case. On April 29, 2020, the court granted that plaintiff’s motion to intervene. On May 7, 2020, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Technology Officer filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking to have the plaintiff that filed the July 18, 2017 complaint dismissed from the
case for lack of standing, arguing that this plaintiff had not continuously owned Oracle stock during the relevant time period. This motion is scheduled for oral
argument on July 9, 2020.
While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, we do not believe this litigation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
Securities Class Action and Derivative Litigation Concerning Oracle’s Cloud Business
On August 10, 2018, a putative class action, brought by an alleged stockholder of Oracle, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California
against us, our Chief Technology Officer, our then-two Chief Executive Officers, two other Oracle executives, and one former Oracle executive. As noted above,
Mr. Hurd, one of our then-two Chief Executive Officers, passed away on October 18, 2019. On March 8, 2019, plaintiff filed an amended complaint. Plaintiff
alleges that the defendants made or are responsible for false and misleading statements regarding Oracle’s cloud business. Plaintiff further alleges that the
former Oracle executive engaged in insider trading. Plaintiff seeks a ruling that this case may proceed as a class action, and seeks damages, attorneys’ fees and
costs, and unspecified declaratory/injunctive relief. On April 19, 2019, defendants moved to dismiss plaintiff’s amended complaint. On December 17, 2019, the
court granted this motion, giving plaintiffs an opportunity to file an amended complaint, which plaintiff filed on February 17, 2020. On April 23, 2020, defendants
filed a motion to dismiss, which is scheduled for hearing on September 24, 2020. We believe that we have meritorious defenses against this action, and we will
continue to vigorously defend it.
On February 12, 2019, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The derivative suit is brought by
two alleged stockholders of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle’s behalf, against all members of our Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant. Plaintiffs
claim that the alleged actions described in the August 10, 2018 class action discussed above caused harm to Oracle, and that Oracle’s Board members violated
their fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, reasonable inquiry, and good faith by failing to prevent this alleged harm. Plaintiffs also allege that defendants’ actions
constitute gross mismanagement, waste, and securities fraud. Plaintiffs seek a ruling that this case may proceed as a derivative action, a finding that defendants
are liable for breaching their fiduciary duties, an order directing defendants to enact corporate reforms, attorneys’ fees and costs, and unspecified equitable
relief. On April 26, 2019, the court approved a stay of this action, which will be lifted if the class action discussed above is dismissed, if the motion to dismiss the
class action is denied, or if either party voluntarily chooses to lift the stay.
On May 8, 2019, a second derivative action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The derivative suit is brought by an alleged
stockholder of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle’s behalf, against our Chief Technology Officer, our then-two Chief Executive Officers, one former Oracle executive,
and Oracle as a nominal defendant. Plaintiff claims that the alleged actions described in the August 10, 2018 class

action discussed above caused harm to Oracle, and plaintiff raises further allegations of impropriety relating to Oracle’s stock buybacks and acquisition of
NetSuite. Plaintiff asserts claims for violation of securities laws, violation of fiduciary duties, contribution and indemnification. Plaintiff seeks a ruling that the
case may proceed as a derivative action, and seeks damages, declaratory and other equitable relief, attorneys’ and expert fees and costs. On June 4, 2019, the
court issued an order finding that this case was related to the derivative case above and staying the case under the court’s prior stay order. On July 8, 2019,
plaintiffs in the two derivative actions filed a consolidated complaint. The actions remain stayed.
While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, we do not believe this litigation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
Other Litigation
We are party to various other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings
and claims that relate to acquisitions we have completed or to companies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire. While the outcome of these matters
cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that are
materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any.
