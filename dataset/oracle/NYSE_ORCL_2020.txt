This selected financial data should be read in conjunction with theconsolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 15 of this Annual report. Over our last five fiscal years, we have acquired a number ofcompanies, including NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite) in fiscal 2017. The results of our acquired companies have been included in our consolidated financial statementssince their respective dates of acquisition and have contributed to our revenues, income, earnings per share and total assets.   As of and for the Year Ended May 31, (in millions, except per share amounts) 2020  2019  2018  2017  2016(4) Consolidated Statements of Operations Data:                    Total revenues $39,068  $39,506  $39,383  $37,792  $37,047 Operating income $13,896  $13,535  $13,264  $12,913  $12,604 Net income(1) $10,135  $11,083  $3,587  $9,452  $8,901 Earnings per share—diluted(1) $3.08  $2.97  $0.85  $2.24  $2.07 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding  3,294   3,732   4,238   4,217   4,305 Cash dividends declared per common share $0.96  $0.81  $0.76  $0.64  $0.60 Consolidated Balance Sheets Data:                    Working capital(2) $34,940  $27,756  $57,035  $50,995  $47,105 Total assets(2) $115,438  $108,709  $137,851  $136,003  $112,180 Notes payable and other borrowings(3) $71,597  $56,167  $60,619  $57,909  $43,855  (1)Our net income and diluted earnings per share were impacted in fiscal 2019 and 2018 by the effects of our adoption of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act). The more significantprovisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described in our Annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019.(2)Working capital and total assets increased in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our fiscal 2020 net income and the issuance of $20.0 billion oflong-term senior notes in fiscal 2020, partially offset by cash used for repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments in fiscal 2020. Working capital and total assets decreased in fiscal 2019primarily due to $36.1 billion of cash used for repurchases of our common stock during fiscal 2019 and also due to dividend payments, partially offset by the favorable impacts to our net current assetsresulting from our fiscal 2019 net income. Working capital and total assets sequentially increased in the fiscal 2016 to 2018 periods presented primarily due to the favorable impacts to our net currentassets resulting from our net income generated during the periods presented and the issuance of long-term senior notes of $10.0 billion in fiscal 2018 and $14.0 billion in fiscal 2017. These workingcapital and total assets increases were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock and dividend payments in the fiscal 2016 to 2018 periods presented. In addition,our total assets were also affected in all periods presented by the repayments of notes payable and other borrowings as discussed further below.(3)Our notes payable and other borrowings, which represented the summation of our notes payable, current, and notes payable and other borrowings, non-current, as reported per our consolidatedbalance sheets as of the dates listed in the table above, increased during fiscal 2020 primarily due to the issuance of $20.0 billion of long-term senior notes.  Notes payable and other borrowingsdecreased during fiscal 2019 primarily due to repayments of certain short-term borrowings and senior notes. Notes payable and other borrowings increased between fiscal 2016 and 2018 primarily dueto the fiscal 2018 issuance of long-term senior notes of $10.0 billion and short-term borrowings of $2.5 billion, the fiscal 2017 issuance of long-term senior notes of $14.0 billion and short-termborrowings of $3.8 billion, and fiscal 2016 short-term borrowings of $3.8 billion. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report for additionalinformation regarding our notes payable and other borrowings.(4)The summary consolidated financial data for the fiscal year ended and as of May 31, 2016 have not been updated to reflect the adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606) orASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Costs and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Costs (ASU 2017-07). refer to our Annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year endedMay 31, 2019 for additional discussion regarding Oracle’s adoption of these accounting pronouncements. 36Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements Total Revenues and Operating Expenses   Year Ended May 31,       Percent Change    (Dollars in millions) 2020  Actual Constant 2019 Total Revenues by Geography:            Americas $21,563  -1% -1% $21,856 EMEA(1)  11,035  -2% 1%  11,270 Asia Pacific  6,470  1% 3%  6,380 Total revenues  39,068  -1% 0%  39,506 Total Operating Expenses  25,172  -3% -2%  25,971 Total Operating Margin $13,896  3% 4% $13,535 Total Operating Margin % 36%      34% % Revenues by Geography:            Americas 55%      55% EMEA 28%      29% Asia Pacific 17%      16% Total Revenues by Business:            Cloud and license $32,519  0% 1% $32,562 Hardware  3,443  -7% -6%  3,704 Services  3,106  -4% -3%  3,240 Total revenues $39,068  -1% 0% $39,506 % Revenues by Business:            Cloud and license 83%      83% Hardware 9%      9% Services 8%      8%  (1)Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and AfricaExcluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues were flat in fiscal 2020. The constant currency increase in our cloud and license business’revenues during fiscal 2020 was offset by decreases in our hardware business’ revenues and services business’ revenues. The constant currency increase in ourcloud and license business’ revenues during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 was attributable to growth in our cloud services and license support revenues ascustomers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud deployment models and license deployment models and renewed their relatedcloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gain access to our latest technologies and support services. The constant currency decrease in ourhardware business’ revenues during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 was due to reductions in our hardware products revenues and hardware support revenuesprimarily due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our cloud-based infrastructure technologies, which resulted in reduced sales volumes ofcertain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of customers that purchased hardware support contracts. The constant currency decrease inour services business’ revenues during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 was attributable to declines in our consulting revenues and education revenues. Due tothe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, all three of our businesses’ revenues were adversely impacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and some of theseeffects may continue into fiscal 2021. While we expect these effects to be temporary, the impacts of COVID-19 for fiscal 2021 and future periods are unknown.On a constant currency basis, fiscal 2020 total revenues growth in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions were partially offset by a decline in the Americas region.Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total operating expenses decreased during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lowerexpenses for substantially all of our operating expense categories other than cloud services and license support expenses, which increased primarily due toheadcount and infrastructure investments that were made to support the increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues; and research and developmentexpenses, which increased primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expenses. We curtailed a number of variable expenditures in our fourth quarter offiscal 2020 including marketing45Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements expenses and employee travel expenses in response to COVID-19. We expect certain of these expenses to normalize in future periods provided global economicconditions improve.In constant currency, our total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues increased in fiscal 2020 due to the decline in ourtotal expenses.Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain ChargesTo supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe that the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financialperformance and prospects for the future.Our operating results reported pursuant to GAAP included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions andcertain other expense and income items that affected our GAAP net income:   Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2020  2019 Cloud services and license support deferred revenues(1) $4  $20 Amortization of intangible assets(2)  1,586   1,689 Acquisition related and other(3)(5)  56   44 restructuring(4)  250   443 Stock-based compensation, operating segments(5)  436   518 Stock-based compensation, r&D and G&A(5)  1,154   1,135 Income tax effects(6)  (939)  (1,406)Income tax reform(7)  —   (389)  $2,547  $2,054  (1)In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support contracts assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, wedid not recognize the cloud services and license support revenue amounts as presented in the above table that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entitiesupon delivery of the contractual obligations. To the extent customers for which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the fullcontracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods.(2)represents the amortization of intangible assets, substantially all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions. As of May 31, 2020, estimated future amortization related to intangibleassets was as follows (in millions):  Fiscal 2021 $1,351  Fiscal 2022  1,102  Fiscal 2023  679  Fiscal 2024  445  Fiscal 2025  126  Thereafter  35  Total intangible assets, net $3,738 (3)Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustmentsafter the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net.(4)restructuring expenses during fiscal 2020 and 2019 primarily related to employee severance in connection with our Fiscal 2019 Oracle restructuring Plan (2019 restructuring Plan). Additionalinformation regarding certain of our restructuring plans is provided in the discussion below under “restructuring Expenses” and in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includedelsewhere in this Annual report.46Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements (5)Stock-based compensation was included in the following operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations (in millions):    Year Ended May 31,    2020  2019  Cloud services and license support $110  $99  Hardware  11   10  Services  54   49  Sales and marketing  261   360  Stock-based compensation, operating segments  436   518  research and development  1,035   963  General and administrative  119   172  Total stock-based compensation $1,590  $1,653 (6)For fiscal 2020 and 2019, the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to our income before provision for income taxes after excluding the tax effects of items within the table above such as for stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, and certain other acquisition related items; and, for fiscal 2019, after excluding a tax benefit arising from the increase of a deferredtax asset associated with a partial realignment of our legal structure and a tax benefit as described in footnote (7) below, resulted in effective tax rates of 18.4% and 18.5% in fiscal 2020 and 2019,respectively, instead of 16.0% and 9.7%, respectively, which represented our effective tax rates as derived per our consolidated statements of operations.(7)The fiscal 2019 income tax reform adjustment presented in the table above was due to an adjustment made pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) related to the enactment of theU.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act). The more significant provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described in our Annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019.Cloud and License BusinessOur cloud and license business engages in the sale and marketing of our applications and infrastructure technologies that are delivered through variousdeployment models and include: Oracle license support offerings; Oracle Cloud Services offerings; and Oracle cloud license and on-premise license offerings.License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud licenses and on-premise licenses; are purchasedby our customers at their option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. Our cloud servicesdeliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspecified updatesand enhancements for, host, manage and support. revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized over the contractual term, which is generally one tothree years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earnedfrom granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud andon-premise IT environments and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download anduse. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to marketcertain of our offerings through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services and license supportexpenses, and sales and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud services andlicense support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings, and marketing program costs.47Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements    Year Ended May 31,       Percent Change    (Dollars in millions) 2020  Actual Constant 2019 Cloud and License Revenues:            Americas(1) $18,314  -1% 0% $18,410 EMEA(1)  9,058  -1% 1%  9,168 Asia Pacific(1)  5,151  3% 4%  5,004 Total revenues(1)  32,523  0% 1%  32,582 Expenses:            Cloud services and license support(2)  3,803  6% 7%  3,597 Sales and marketing(2)  7,159  -3% -2%  7,398 Total expenses(2)  10,962  0% 1%  10,995 Total Margin $21,561  0% 1% $21,587 Total Margin % 66%      66% % Revenues by Geography:            Americas 56%      57% EMEA 28%      28% Asia Pacific 16%      15% Revenues by Offerings:            Cloud services and license support(1) $27,396  3% 4% $26,727 Cloud license and on-premise license  5,127  -12% -11%  5,855 Total revenues(1) $32,523  0% 1% $32,582 Cloud Services and License Support Revenues by Ecosystem:            Applications cloud services and license support(1) $11,019  4% 5% $10,572 Infrastructure cloud services and license support(1)  16,377  1% 3%  16,155 Total cloud services and license support revenues(1) $27,396  3% 4% $26,727 (1)Includes cloud services and license support revenue adjustments related to certain cloud services and license support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded as revenues by the acquiredbusinesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our GAAP-based consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to business combination accounting requirements.Such revenue adjustments were included in our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs. See “Presentation of Operating Segment results and Other FinancialInformation” above for additional information.(2)Excludes stock-based compensation and certain expense allocations. Also excludes amortization of intangible assets and certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operatingsegment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segment results and Other Financial Information” above.Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total revenues increased in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 due to growth inour cloud services and license support revenues, which was primarily due to increased customer purchases and renewals of cloud-based services and licensesupport contracts in recent periods for which we delivered such services during fiscal 2020. Our cloud and license business’ revenues were adversely impactedduring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular our cloud license and on-premise license revenues. In constant currency, theAmericas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 8%, 34% and 58%, respectively, of the constant currency revenue growth for this business in fiscal 2020.In constant currency, our total cloud and license business’ expenses increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 due to higher cloud services and licensesupport expenses during fiscal 2020, which were primarily attributable to higher employee related expenses and higher technology infrastructure expenses tosupport the increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues. These constant currency expense increases were partially offset by lower sales and marketingexpenses, which were primarily due to our curtailment of variable expenditures in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, including reduced marketing expenses andemployee travel expenses, in response to COVID-19.  48Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total margin increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 due to the fiscal2020 increases in revenues for this business, while total fiscal 2020 margins as a percentage of revenues remained flat.Hardware BusinessOur hardware business’ revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, server, storage, and industry-specific hardware offerings. Thehardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as acombined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardwareproduct is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardwaresupport contracts purchased by our customers at their option and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are deliveredover the contractual term, which is generally one year. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independentdistributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with ourhardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internalmanufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact ofinventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide supportservices; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of ourhardware offerings.   Year Ended May 31,       Percent Change    (Dollars in millions) 2020  Actual Constant 2019 Hardware Revenues:            Americas $1,758  -7% -6% $1,889 EMEA  998  -8% -5%  1,082 Asia Pacific  687  -6% -5%  733 Total revenues  3,443  -7% -6%  3,704 Expenses:            Hardware products and support(1)  1,084  -18% -17%  1,327 Sales and marketing(1)  456  -12% -11%  520 Total expenses(1)  1,540  -17% -15%  1,847 Total Margin $1,903  2% 4% $1,857 Total Margin % 55%      50% % Revenues by Geography:            Americas 51%      51% EMEA 29%      29% Asia Pacific 20%      20% (1)Excludes stock-based compensation and certain expense allocations. Also excludes amortization of intangible assets and certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operatingsegment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segments and Other Financial Information” above.Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware revenues decreased in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 due to lower hardware productsrevenues and lower hardware support revenues. The decreases in hardware products and hardware support revenues in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 wereprimarily attributable to our continued emphasis on the marketing and sale of our cloud-based infrastructure technologies, which resulted in reduced salesvolumes of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of hardware support contracts sold in recent periods. Our hardware business’revenues were also adversely impacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the economic effects caused by COVID-19. These unfavorable49Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements impacts to our fiscal 2020 hardware revenues were partially offset by increased hardware revenues related to certain of our strategic hardware offerings, namelyour Oracle Exadata offerings.Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware expenses decreased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower hardwareproducts expenses, lower hardware support costs, and lower sales and marketing expenses, all of which aligned to lower hardware revenues.In constant currency, total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues for our hardware business increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019primarily due to lower hardware expenses.Services BusinessWe offer services to customers and partners to help maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.Services revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed. The cost of providing our services consists primarily of personnel relatedexpenses, technology infrastructure expenditures, facilities expenses and external contractor expenses.   Year Ended May 31,       Percent Change    (Dollars in millions) 2020  Actual Constant 2019 Services Revenues:            Americas $1,496  -5% -4% $1,576 EMEA  979  -4% -1%  1,021 Asia Pacific  631  -2% -1%  643 Total revenues  3,106  -4% -3%  3,240 Total Expenses(1)  2,656  -2% 0%  2,703 Total Margin $450  -16% -15% $537 Total Margin % 14%      17% % Revenues by Geography:            Americas 48%      49% EMEA 32%      31% Asia Pacific 20%      20%  (1)Excludes stock-based compensation and certain allocations. Also excludes certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting toand review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segments and Other Financial Information” above.Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our total services revenues decreased in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 primarily due to declines in ourconsulting services and education services revenues. Our services business revenues were also adversely impacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due tothe impacts of COVID-19, including the impacts of consulting project delays due to customer resource constraints and jurisdictional restrictions imposed withrespect to in-person meetings. In addition, we incurred lower billable travel expenses and lower billable sub-contractor expenses for which we were to bereimbursed by our customers, which reduced the amount of revenues and expenses we reported for this business during fiscal 2020.In constant currency, total services expenses were flat in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 as lower expenses incurred for travel and sub-contractors asdescribed above and lower expenses related to the delivery of our education services were offset by higher employee related expenses associated with ourconsulting offerings during fiscal 2020. In constant currency, total margin and total margin as a percentage of total services revenues decreased during fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 due to thedecrease in total revenues for this business.Research and Development Expenses: research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures. We intend to continue to investsignificantly in our research and development efforts because, in our judgment, they are essential to maintaining our competitive position.50Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements    Year Ended May 31,       Percent Change    (Dollars in millions) 2020  Actual Constant 2019 research and development(1) $5,032  -1% 0% $5,063 Stock-based compensation  1,035  7% 7%  963 Total expenses $6,067  1% 1% $6,026 % of Total Revenues 15%      15%  (1)Excluding stock-based compensationOn a constant currency basis, total research and development expenses increased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expenses, modestly higher employee salary expenses, and higher infrastructure expenses during fiscal 2020 that were partially offset bylower variable compensation expenses and lower travel expenses due to the impacts of COVID-19.General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel related expenditures for IT, finance, legal and humanresources support functions.   Year Ended May 31,       Percent Change    (Dollars in millions) 2020  Actual Constant 2019 General and administrative(1) $1,062  -3% -1% $1,093 Stock-based compensation  119  -31% -31%  172 Total expenses $1,181  -7% -6% $1,265 % of Total Revenues 3%      3%  (1)Excluding stock-based compensationExcluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due tolower stock-based compensation expenses, lower professional services fees, lower variable compensation expenses, and lower travel expenses due to theimpacts of COVID-19. These decreases were partially offset by modestly higher fiscal 2020 employee salary expenses in constant currency.Amortization of Intangible Assets:  Substantially all of our intangible assets were acquired through our business combinations. We amortize our intangible assetsover, and monitor the appropriateness of, the estimated useful lives of these assets. We also periodically review these intangible assets for potential impairmentbased upon relevant facts and circumstances. Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report has additionalinformation regarding our intangible assets and related amortization.   Year Ended May 31,       Percent Change    (Dollars in millions) 2020  Actual Constant 2019 Developed technology $789  -8% -8% $857 Cloud services and license support agreements and related relationships  676  -5% -5%  712 Other  121  2% 2%  120 Total amortization of intangible assets $1,586  -6% -6% $1,689 Amortization of intangible assets decreased in fiscal 2020 due to a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fullyamortized, partially offset by additional amortization from intangible assets that we acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions.Acquisition Related and Other Expenses: Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain otheremployees, certain business combination adjustments including adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net.51Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements    Year Ended May 31,       Percent Change    (Dollars in millions) 2020  Actual Constant 2019 Transitional and other employee related costs $12  -77% -77% $49 Business combination adjustments, net  (7) -67% -71%  (21)Other, net  51  227% 228%  16 Total acquisition related and other expenses $56  27% 29% $44  On a constant currency basis, acquisition related and other expenses increased during fiscal 2020 due to higher other expenses, net including asset impairmentcosts related to certain right of use assets and other assets that were abandoned in connection with plans to improve our cost structure and operationsprospectively. In addition, during fiscal 2019 we recorded certain business combination related adjustments that benefited our expenses during this period.These increases to our fiscal 2020 expenses growth were partially offset by lower fiscal 2020 transitional employee related costs.Restructuring Expenses: restructuring expenses resulted from the execution of management approved restructuring plans that were generally developed toimprove our cost structure and/or operations, often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies. restructuring expenses consist of employeeseverance costs and other contract termination costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. Prior to fiscal 2020, restructuring expenses also includedcharges for duplicate facilities. For additional information regarding our restructuring plans, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements includedelsewhere in this Annual report.   Year Ended May 31,       Percent Change    (Dollars in millions) 2020  Actual Constant 2019 restructuring expenses $250  -44% -42% $443 restructuring expenses in fiscal 2020 and 2019 primarily related to our 2019 restructuring Plan. Our management approved, committed to and initiated the2019 restructuring Plan in order to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations. We may incur additional restructuring expenses in futureperiods due to the initiation of new restructuring plans or from changes in estimated costs associated with existing restructuring plans.The majority of the initiatives undertaken by our 2019 restructuring Plan were effected to implement our continued emphasis in developing, marketing andselling our cloud-based offerings. These initiatives impacted certain of our sales and marketing and research and development operations. Cost savings that areexpected to be realized pursuant to our 2019 restructuring Plan initiatives may be offset by investments in resources and geographies that best address thedevelopment, marketing and sale of our cloud‑based offerings including investments in our second‑generation cloud infrastructure.Interest Expense:   Year Ended May 31,       Percent Change    (Dollars in millions) 2020  Actual Constant 2019 Interest expense $1,995  -4% -4% $2,082 Interest expense decreased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the maturities and repayments of $4.5 billion of senior notes during fiscal2020 and $2.0 billion of senior notes during fiscal 2019.  This decrease in interest expense during fiscal 2020 was partially offset by additional interest expenseincurred related to our issuance of $20.0 billion of senior notes in April 2020.52Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements Non-Operating Income, net: Non-operating income, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange gains (losses), the noncontrollinginterests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (primarily Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Corporation Japan) and net otherincome (losses), including net realized gains and losses related to all of our investments, net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of ourinvestment portfolio related to our deferred compensation plan, net unrealized gains and losses related to certain equity securities and non-service net periodicpension income (losses).   Year Ended May 31,       Percent Change    (Dollars in millions) 2020  Actual Constant 2019 Interest income $527  -52% -51% $1,092 Foreign currency losses, net  (185) 67% 69%  (111)Noncontrolling interests in income  (164) 8% 8%  (152)Other, net  (16) 13% 25%  (14)Total non-operating income, net $162  -80% -80% $815  On a constant currency basis, our non-operating income, net decreased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower interest income in fiscal2020, which was primarily attributable to lower average cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances and, to a lesser extent, lower interest rateson these balances during fiscal 2020, and also due to higher fiscal 2020 foreign currency losses.Provision for Income Taxes: Our effective income tax rates for each of the periods presented were the result of the mix of income earned in various taxjurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annualreport for a discussion regarding the differences between the effective income tax rates as presented for the periods below and the U.S. federal statutoryincome tax rates that were in effect during these periods. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings weighted tojurisdictions with higher tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, by adverse rulings in tax related litigation, or by shortfalls in stock-basedcompensation realized by employees relative to stock-based compensation that was recorded for book purposes, among others.  Year Ended May 31,       Percent Change    (Dollars in millions) 2020  Actual Constant 2019 Provision for income taxes $1,928  63% 66% $1,185 Effective tax rate 16.0%      9.7% Provision for income taxes increased in fiscal 2020 relative to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the absence in fiscal 2020 of tax benefits we recorded in fiscal 2019attributable to changes in estimates related to our adoption of the Tax Act, as recorded pursuant to SAB 118, and the increase of a deferred tax asset associatedwith the partial realignment of our legal structure.Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of May 31, (Dollars in millions)2020  Change 2019 Working capital$34,940  26% $27,756 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$43,057  14% $37,827 53Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements Working capital: The increase in working capital as of May 31, 2020 in comparison to May 31, 2019 was primarily due to our issuance of $20.0 billion of long-term senior notes in April 2020 (refer to recent Financing Activities below for additional information), the favorable impacts to our net current assets resultingfrom our net income during fiscal 2020 and cash proceeds from stock option exercises. These favorable working capital movements were partially offset by cashused for repurchases of our common stock, the reclassification of $1.0 billion and €1.25 billion of long-term senior notes as current liabilities, cash used to paydividends to our stockholders during fiscal 2020, and the prospective recognition of current operating lease liabilities associated with our adoption of Topic 842as of June 1, 2019. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which arevariable.Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper andother securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of corporate debt securities and certain other securities. The increase incash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2020 in comparison to May 31, 2019 was primarily due to our issuance of $20.0 billion of long-termsenior notes in April 2020, cash inflows generated by our operations and cash inflows from stock option exercises during fiscal 2020. These cash inflows werepartially offset by certain cash outflows, primarily $19.2 billion used for repurchases of our common stock, the repayment of $4.5 billion of borrowings, paymentsof cash dividends to our stockholders and cash used for capital expenditures.The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash, cash equivalents andmarketable securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as ofthe end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in our consolidatedbalance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual report). As theU.S. Dollar generally strengthened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2020, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketablesecurities that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries decreased on a net basis as of May 31, 2020 relative to what we would have reported usingconstant currency rates from the May 31, 2019 balance sheet date.  Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2020  Change 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities $13,139  -10% $14,551 Net cash provided by investing activities $9,843  -63% $26,557 Net cash used for financing activities $(6,132) -85% $(42,056)Cash flows from operating activities: Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal oftheir license support agreements. Payments from customers for these support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’ terms,which are generally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the sales of new licenses, cloud services,hardware offerings and other services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturingcosts related to the production of our hardware products, taxes, interest payments and leased facilities.Net cash provided by operating activities decreased during fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to lower net income and certain cash unfavorablechanges in the timing of payments received from customers during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which we believe were attributable to the unfavorableglobal economic effects that resulted from COVID-19. We expect to collect substantially all of these delayed customer payments in future periods.Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales ofour investments in marketable securities, and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth.54Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements Net cash provided by investing activities decreased during fiscal 2020 primarily due to a fiscal 2020 decrease in proceeds from the maturities and sales ofmarketable securities and other investments and a fiscal 2020 increase in the purchase of marketable securities and other investments, in each case relative tofiscal 2019.Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debtinstruments, stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs.Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2020 decreased compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a decrease in our stock repurchases for which weused $19.2 billion in fiscal 2020 in comparison to $36.1 billion in fiscal 2019; and our fiscal 2020 issuance of $20.0 billion of senior notes (none in fiscal 2019).Free cash flow: To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis toanalyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with ourcompetitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of ourperformance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flow as follows:   Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2020  Change 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities $13,139  -10% $14,551 Capital expenditures  (1,564) -6%  (1,660)Free cash flow $11,575  -10% $12,891 Net income $10,135    $11,083 Free cash flow as percent of net income 114%    116% Long-Term Customer Financing: We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire licenses, cloud services, hardware and services offerings throughseparate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financialinstitutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution. We generally record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions assales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. We financed $1.0 billion in each of fiscal2020 and 2019 and $1.5 billion in fiscal 2018 or approximately 19%, 17% and 25%, respectively, of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues in fiscal2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Recent Financing Activities:Cash Dividends: In fiscal 2020, we declared and paid cash dividends of $0.96 per share that totaled $3.1 billion. In June 2020, our Board of Directors declared aquarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 28, 2020 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July15, 2020. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board ofDirectors.Senior Notes: In April 2020, we issued $20.0 billion of senior notes comprised of the following:                                 •$3.50 billion of 2.50% senior notes due April 2025;     •$2.25 billion of 2.80% senior notes due April 2027;                     •$3.25 billion of 2.95% senior notes due April 2030;     •$3.00 billion of 3.60% senior notes due April 2040; •$4.50 billion of 3.60% senior notes due April 2050; and  55Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements  •$3.50 billion of 3.85% senior notes due April 2060.We issued the senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, repaymentof indebtedness and future acquisitions. Additionally, in fiscal 2020, we repaid $4.5 billion of senior notes pursuant to their terms. Additional details regardingour senior notes are included in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report.Common Stock Repurchase Program: Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On September 11, 2019and March 12, 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program collectively totaling $30.0 billion. As ofMay 31, 2020, approximately $16.6 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 361.0 millionshares for $19.2 billion, 733.8 million shares for $36.0 billion, and 238.0 million shares for $11.5 billion in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our stockrepurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, ourcash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic andmarket conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stockrepurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.  Contractual Obligations: The contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under our fixed contractualobligations and commitments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates and other factors may result in actual paymentsdiffering from these estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the mostsignificant assumptions used in preparing this information within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Thefollowing is a summary of our material contractual obligations as of May 31, 2020:       Year Ending May 31,     (in millions) Total  2021  2022  2023  2024  2025  Thereafter Principal payments on borrowings(1) $72,115  $2,631  $8,250  $3,750  $3,500  $10,000  $43,984 Interest payments on borrowings(1)  37,664   2,431   2,291   2,150   2,038   1,926   26,828 Operating leases(2)  2,315   616   519   350   252   192   386 Tax obligations(3)  6,046   576   576   576   1,080   1,440   1,798 Purchase obligations and other(4)  1,263   881   66   30   27   23   236 Total contractual obligations $119,403  $7,135  $11,702  $6,856  $6,897  $13,581  $73,232 (1)represents the principal balances and interest payments to be paid in connection with our senior notes and other borrowings outstanding as of May 31, 2020 after considering: •certain interest rate swap agreements for certain series of senior notes that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with these senior notes so that theyeffectively became variable pursuant to a LIBOr-based index. Interest payments on these senior notes have been presented in the table above after consideration of these fixed to variableinterest rate swap agreements based upon the interest rates applicable as of May 31, 2020 and are subject to change in future periods; •certain cross-currency swap agreements for our €1.25 billion 2.25% senior notes due January 2021 that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, includingannual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt with a fixed annual interest rate. Principal and interest payments for thesesenior notes were calculated and presented in the table above based on the terms of these cross-currency swap agreements; and •certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements for our €750 million 3.125% senior notes due July 2025 that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt,including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a variable-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt. Principal and interest payments for these senior notes werecalculated and presented in the table above based on the terms of these cross-currency interest rate swap agreements as of May 31, 2020 and the interest payments are subject to change infuture periods.refer to Notes 7 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report for additional information related to our notes payable and other borrowings and relatedderivative agreements.(2)represents operating lease liabilities for facilities, data centers, and vehicles.(3)represents the future cash payments related to the transition tax payable incurred as a result of the Tax Act. The more significant provisions of the Tax Act as applicable to us are described in our Annualreport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2019.56Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements (4)Primarily represents amounts associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding; terms include: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable priceprovisions; and the approximate timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly and testing offinished hardware products. We also obtain individual hardware components for our products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such purchasecommitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times forthe particular part or product and have been included in the amount presented in the above contractual obligations table. routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to ourexternal manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts presented above, as they are generally entered into inorder to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way.As of May 31, 2020, we had $8.4 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our consolidated balancesheet, and all such obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to the uncertainty as to when they might be settled orreleased with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal2021. We are involved in claims and legal proceedings. All such claims and obligations have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due tothe uncertainty of claims and legal proceedings and associated estimates and assumptions, all of which are inherently unpredictable and many aspects of whichare out of our control. Notes 14 and 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report includes additional informationregarding these contingencies.We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital,capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements. In addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments andrepurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additionalborrowings or from the issuance of additional securities.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect onour financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that arematerial to investors.Selected Quarterly Financial DataThe following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters. We believe that all necessary adjustments, whichconsisted only of normal recurring adjustments, have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read inconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual report. The sum of the quarterly financialinformation may vary from annual data due to rounding. refer to “Seasonality and Cyclicality” in Item 1 and “Business Overview” in Item 7 included elsewherewithin this Annual report for additional information regarding the seasonality of our revenues, expenses and margins and the impacts of COVID-19 on ourbusiness during fiscal 2020.   Fiscal 2020 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31  November 30  February 29  May 31 revenues $9,218  $9,614  $9,796  $10,440 Gross profit $7,261  $7,566  $7,832  $8,471 Operating income $2,877  $3,183  $3,528  $4,309 Net income $2,137  $2,311  $2,571  $3,116 Earnings per share—basic $0.64  $0.71  $0.81  $1.01 Earnings per share—diluted $0.63  $0.69  $0.79  $0.99 57Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements    Fiscal 2019 Quarter Ended (Unaudited) (in millions, except per share amounts) August 31  November 30  February 28  May 31 revenues $9,193  $9,562  $9,614  $11,136 Gross profit $7,240  $7,561  $7,638  $9,073 Operating income $2,778  $3,101  $3,399  $4,257 Net income $2,265  $2,333  $2,745  $3,740 Earnings per share—basic $0.58  $0.63  $0.78  $1.10 Earnings per share—diluted $0.57  $0.61  $0.76  $1.07  Restricted Stock-Based Awards and Stock OptionsOur stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employeesand align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders.We recognize that restricted stock-based awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awardsgranted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2017 has been aweighted-average annualized rate of 1.5% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stock-based awardsand stock options granted and assumed, net of restricted stock-based awards and stock options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by theweighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stock-based awards vest andstock options are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options at May 31, 2020, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, substantially all have exerciseprices lower than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect ofour stock-based compensation program. However, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors, includingthe amount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. As of May 31, 2020, themaximum potential dilution from all outstanding restricted stock-based awards and unexercised stock options, regardless of when granted and regardless ofwhether vested or unvested and including stock options where the strike price is higher than the market price as of such date, was 9.0%.During fiscal 2020, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants toselected employees; all stock-based award grants to senior officers; and any individual grant of restricted stock units of 62,500 or greater. The annualorganization-wide stock-based award grants to selected employees are generally approved by the Compensation Committee during the ten business day periodfollowing the second trading day after the announcement of our fiscal fourth quarter earnings report.

Our bank deposits and timedeposits are generally held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investment-grade credit ratings or financial institutions that meetinvestment-grade ratings criteria, which we believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks. In addition, as of May 31, 2020, substantially all of ourmarketable securities were high quality with substantially all having maturity dates within one year (a description of our marketable securities held is included inNotes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report and “Liquidity and Capital resources” above). We held amix of both fixed and floating-rate debt securities. Fixed rate securities may have their market values adversely impacted as interest rates increase, while floatingrate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may vary due to changesin interest rates or we may realize losses if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because weclassify our debt securities as “available for sale,” no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior tomaturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other-than-temporary. The fair values of our fixed-rate debt securities are impacted by interest ratemovements and if interest rates would have been higher by 50 basis points as of each of May 31, 2020 and 2019 we estimate the change would have decreasedthe fair values of our marketable securities holdings by $15 million and $128 million, respectively. We generally do not use our investments for trading purposes.Changes in the overall level of interest rates affect the interest income that is generated from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For fiscal2020 and 2019, total interest income was $527 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, with our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities investmentsyielding an average 1.47% and 2.08%, respectively, on a worldwide basis.59Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements ORACLE CORPORATIONCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETSAs of May 31, 2020 and 2019   May 31, (in millions, except per

Deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences oftemporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes. Werecord a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.A two-step approach is applied pursuant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit,including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50%likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of ourconsolidated statements of operations.A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as a part of a business combination isprovided under “Business Combinations” above.Recent Accounting PronouncementsFinancial Instruments: In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform onFinancial Reporting (ASU 2020-04). ASU 2020-04 provides optional guidance for contract modifications and certain hedging relationships associated with thetransition from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. ASU 2020-04 is effective for all entities upon issuance through December 31, 2022. We arestill evaluating the impact, but do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, Investments—Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), andDerivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) (ASU 2020-01). ASU 2020-01 clarifies the interaction of the accounting for equity securities under Topic 321, the accountingfor equity method investments in Topic 323, and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options in Topic 815. ASU 2020-01 is effective for usin the first quarter of fiscal 2022, and earlier adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2020-01 on ourconsolidated financial statements.In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13) and also issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance (collectively, Topic 326). Topic 326 requires measurement and recognition of expected creditlosses for financial assets held. We will adopt Topic 326 effective June 1, 2020 with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded as an adjustment to accumulateddeficit. We currently do not expect that our pending adoption of Topic 326 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.Income Taxes:  In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12), which isintended to simplify various areas related to the accounting for income taxes and improve consistent application of Topic 740.

Wehave included the financial results of Aconex in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. These results were not individually material toour85Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2020 consolidated financial statements. The total purchase price for Aconex was approximately $1.2 billion, which consisted of approximately $1.2 billion in cash and$7 million for the fair values of stock options and restricted stock-based awards assumed. In allocating the purchase price based on estimated fair values, werecorded approximately $873 million of goodwill, $377 million of identifiable intangible assets, and $29 million of net liabilities. Goodwill generated from ouracquisition of Aconex was primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition and is tax deductible.Other Fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 AcquisitionsDuring fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, we acquired certain other companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand ourproducts and services offerings. These acquisitions were not significant individually or in the aggregate to our consolidated financial statements. 3.CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIESCash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, money market funds and other securitieswith original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain othersecurities.The amortized principal amounts of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated their fair values at May 31, 2020 and 2019. We use thespecific identification method to determine any realized gains or losses from the sale of our marketable securities classified as available-for-sale. Such realizedgains and losses were insignificant for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018. The following table summarizes the components of our cash equivalents and marketablesecurities held, substantially all of which were classified as available-for-sale:   May 31, (in millions) 2020  2019 Corporate debt securities and other $6,625  $22,242 Commercial paper debt securities  5,640   — Money market funds  18,587   5,700 Total investments $30,852  $27,942 Investments classified as cash equivalents $25,034  $10,629 Investments classified as marketable securities $5,818  $17,313  As of May 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately 99% and 33%, respectively, of our marketable securities investments mature within one year and 1% and 67%,respectively, mature within one to four years. Our investment portfolio is subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates. As described above, we limitpurchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities, which have high credit ratings and also limit the amount of credit exposure to any oneissuer. As stated in our investment policy, we are averse to principal loss and seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.restricted cash that was included within cash and cash equivalents as presented within our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2020 and 2019 and ourconsolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended May 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was nominal.86Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2020 4.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSWe perform fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid totransfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assetsand liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and considerassumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs whenmeasuring fair value. An asset’s or a liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fairvalue measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: •Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; •Level 2: inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets orliabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can becorroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or •Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisOur assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following (Level 1 and Level 2 inputs are defined above):   May 31, 2020  May 31, 2019   Fair Value MeasurementsUsing Input Types      Fair Value MeasurementsUsing Input Types     (in millions) Level 1  Level 2  Total  Level 1  Level 2  Total Assets:                        Corporate debt securities and other $4,036  $2,589  $6,625  $4,899  $17,343  $22,242 Commercial paper debt securities  —   5,640   5,640   —   —   — Money market funds  18,587   —   18,587   5,700   —   5,700 Derivative financial instruments  —   29   29   —   5   5 Total assets $22,623  $8,258  $30,881  $10,599  $17,348  $27,947 Liabilities:                        Derivative financial instruments $—  $268  $268  $—  $230  $230  Our marketable securities investments consist of Tier 1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain other securities. Marketablesecurities as presented per our consolidated balance sheets included securities with original maturities at the time of purchase greater than three months andthe remainder of the securities were included in cash and cash equivalents. Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of our instruments thatwere classified as Level 1 in the table above were derived from quoted market prices and active markets for these instruments that exist. Our valuationtechniques used to measure the fair values of Level 2 instruments listed in the table above, the counterparties to which have high credit ratings, were derivedfrom the following: non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated by observable market data, quoted market prices for similar instruments, orpricing models, such as discounted cash flow techniques,87Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2020 with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data including LIBOr-based yield curves, among others.Based on the trading prices of the $71.6 billion and $56.1 billion of senior notes and the related fair value hedges (refer to Notes 7 and 10 for additionalinformation) that we had outstanding as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, the estimated fair values of the senior notes and the related fair value hedgesusing Level 2 inputs at May 31, 2020 and 2019 were $80.9 billion and $58.4 billion, respectively.5.PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENTProperty, plant and equipment, net consisted of the following:   Estimated May 31, (Dollars in millions) Useful Life 2020  2019 Computer, network, machinery and equipment 1-5 years $7,757  $7,214 Buildings and improvements 1-40 years  4,394   4,253 Furniture, fixtures and other 5-15 years  509   554 Land —  885   896 Construction in progress —  280   158 Total property, plant and equipment 1-40 years  13,825   13,075 Accumulated depreciation    (7,581)  (6,823)Total property, plant and equipment, net   $6,244  $6,252  6.INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILLThe changes in intangible assets for fiscal 2020 and the net book value of intangible assets as of May 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:   Intangible Assets, Gross  Accumulated Amortization  Intangible Assets, Net  WeightedAverageUsefulLife(2) (Dollars in millions) May 31,2019  Additions &Adjustments net(1)  Retirements  May 31,2020  May 31,2019  Expense  Retirements  May 31,2020  May 31,2019  May 31,2020   Developed technology $5,406  $31  $(966) $4,471  $(3,467) $(789) $966  $(3,290) $1,939  $1,181   4 Cloud services and license supportagreements and related relationships  5,693   12   (116)  5,589   (2,711)  (676)  116   (3,271)  2,982   2,318   4 Other  1,589   2   (250)  1,341   (1,231)  (121)  250   (1,102)  358   239   4 Total intangible assets, net $12,688  $45  $(1,332) $11,401  $(7,409) $(1,586) $1,332  $(7,663) $5,279  $3,738      (1)Amounts also include any net changes in intangible asset balances for the periods presented that resulted from foreign currency translations.(2)represents weighted-average useful lives (in years) of intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2020.As of May 31, 2020, estimated future amortization expenses related to intangible assets were as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2021 $1,351 Fiscal 2022  1,102 Fiscal 2023  679 Fiscal 2024  445 Fiscal 2025  126 Thereafter  35 Total intangible assets, net $3,738  88Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2020 The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill, net, which is generally not deductible for tax purposes, for our operating segments for fiscal 2020 and 2019were as follows: (in millions) Cloud and License  Hardware  Services  Total Goodwill, net Balances as of May 31, 2018 $39,600  $2,367  $1,788  $43,755 Goodwill from acquisitions  96   —   —   96 Goodwill adjustments, net(1)  (63)  —   (9)  (72)Balances as of May 31, 2019  39,633   2,367   1,779   43,779 Goodwill from acquisitions  74   —   —   74 Goodwill adjustments, net(1)  (70)  —   (14)  (84)Balances as of May 31, 2020 $39,637  $2,367  $1,765  $43,769  (1)Pursuant to our business combinations accounting policy, we recorded goodwill adjustments for the effects on goodwill of changes to net assets acquired during the period that such a change isidentified, provided that any such change is within the measurement period (up to one year from the date of the acquisition).

Deferredservices revenues include prepayments for our services business and revenues for these services are generally recognized as the services are performed.Deferred cloud license and on-premise license revenues typically resulted from customer payments that related to undelivered products and services or specifiedenhancements.In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support performance obligations assumed from ouracquired companies. We generally have estimated the fair values of these obligations assumed using a cost build-up approach. The cost build-up approachdetermines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. The sum of the costs and operating profitapproximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume these acquired obligations. These aforementioned fair valueadjustments recorded for obligations assumed from our acquisitions reduced the cloud services and license support deferred revenues balances that werecorded as liabilities from these acquisitions and also reduced the resulting revenues that we recognized or will recognize over the terms of the acquiredobligations during the post-combination periods. refer to Note 15 for additional information.10.DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSFair Value Hedges—Interest Rate Swap Agreements and Cross-Currency Interest Rate Swap AgreementsIn May 2018, we entered into certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our July2025 Notes by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro denominated 2025 Notes, including the annual interest payments and the payment of principal atmaturity, to variable-rate, U.S. Dollar denominated debt based on LIBOr. In July 2014, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have theeconomic effect of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with our July 2021 Notes so that the interest payable on these senior notes effectivelybecame variable based on LIBOr. The critical terms of the swap agreements match the critical terms of the July 2025 Notes and July 2021 Notes that the swapagreements pertain to, including the notional amounts and maturity dates.We have designated the aforementioned swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for them as fair value hedges pursuant to ASC815. The changes in fair values of the cross-currency interest rate swap agreements associated with our July 2025 Notes are recognized as interest expense andnon-operating income, net in our consolidated statements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in non-current assets or non-current liabilitiesin our consolidated balance sheets.94Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2020 The changes in fair values of our interest rate swap agreements associated with our July 2021 Notes are recognized as interest expense in our consolidatedstatements of operations with the corresponding amounts included in other non-current assets or other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balancesheets. The amount of net gain (loss) attributable to the interest rate risk being hedged is recognized as interest expense and amount of net gain (loss)attributable to the foreign exchange risk being hedged, as applicable, is recognized as non-operating income, net in our consolidated statements of operationswith the corresponding amount included in notes payable, current or notes payable, non-current. We exclude the portion of the change in fair value of cross-currency interest rate swap agreements attributable to the related cross-currency basis spread in our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The change in fair valueof these cross-currency interest rate swap agreements attributable to the cross-currency basis spread is included in AOCL. The periodic interest settlements forthe swap agreements for the July 2025 Notes and July 2021 Notes are recorded as interest expense and are included as a part of cash flows from operatingactivities and, for the swap agreements associated with the July 2025 Notes, the cash flows that pertain to the principal balance are classified as financingactivities.Cash Flow Hedges—Cross-Currency Swap AgreementsIn connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements to manage the related foreign currencyexchange risk by effectively converting the fixed-rate, Euro-denominated January 2021 Notes, including the annual interest payments and the payment ofprincipal at maturity, to fixed-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt. The economic effect of the swap agreements was to eliminate the uncertainty of the cashflows in U.S. Dollars associated with the January 2021 Notes by fixing the principal amount of the January 2021 Notes at $1.6 billion with a fixed annual interestrate of 3.53%. We have designated these cross-currency swap agreements as qualifying hedging instruments and are accounting for these as cash flow hedgespursuant to ASC 815. The critical terms of the cross-currency swap agreements correspond to the January 2021 Notes including the annual interest paymentsbeing hedged, and the cross-currency swap agreements mature at the same time as the January 2021 Notes.We used the hypothetical derivative method to assess the effectiveness of our cross-currency swap agreements. The fair values of these cross-currency swapagreements are recognized as other current assets or other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. We reflect the gains or losses on the effectiveportion of these cross-currency swap agreements in AOCL in our consolidated balance sheets and an amount is reclassified out of AOCL into non-operatingincome, net in the same period that the carrying values of the Euro-denominated January 2021 Notes are remeasured and the interest expense is recognized.The cash flows related to the cross-currency swap agreements that pertain to the periodic interest settlements are classified as operating activities and the cashflows that pertain to the principal balance are classified as financing activities.Foreign Currency Forward Contracts Not Designated as HedgesWe transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risksassociated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign currency forward contracts so thatincreases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts in order to mitigate the risks andvolatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise fromintercompany sublicense fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are generally expected to be cash settled in the near term. Ourforeign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generallydepend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in thoserates, the net realized and unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.95Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2020 We do not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we recorded the fair values of these contracts as of theend of each reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. The balancesheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other currentliabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts isnon-operating income, net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses.As of May 31, 2020 and 2019, the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major internationalcurrencies were $4.2 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other majorinternational currencies were $3.9 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal atMay 31, 2020 and 2019. The cash flows related to these foreign currency contracts are classified as operating activities.The effects of derivative instruments designated as hedges on certain of our consolidated financial statements were as follows as of or for each of the respectiveperiods presented below (amounts presented exclude any income tax effects):Fair Values of Derivative Instruments Designated as Hedges in Consolidated Balance Sheets     Fair Value as of May 31, (in millions) Balance Sheet Location 2020  2019 Derivative assets:          Interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges Other non-current assets $29  $5 Total derivative assets   $29  $5 Derivative liabilities:          Cross-currency swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges Other current liabilities $251  $— Interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges Other current liabilities  —   5 Cross-currency interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges Other non-current liabilities  17   17 Cross-currency swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges Other non-current liabilities  —   208 Total derivative liabilities   $268  $230  Effects of Fair Value Hedging Relationships on Hedged Items in Consolidated Balance Sheets   May 31, (in millions) 2020  2019 Notes payable, current:        Carrying amount of hedged item $—  $1,994 Cumulative hedging adjustments included in the carrying amount  —   (5)Notes payable and other borrowings, non-current:        Carrying amounts of hedged items  3,680   3,652 Cumulative hedging adjustments included in the carrying amount  75   44  96Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2020 Effects of Derivative Instruments Designated as Hedges on Income   Year Ended May 31,   2020  2019  2018 (in millions) Non-operatingincome, net  Interestexpense  Non-operatingincome, net  Interestexpense  Non-operatingincome, net  Interestexpense Consolidated statements of operations line amounts in which thehedge effects were recorded $162  $(1,995) $815  $(2,082) $1,185  $(2,025)Gain (loss) on hedges recognized in income:                        Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges:                        Derivative instruments $—  $29  $—  $31  $—  $(66)Hedged items  —   (29)  —   (31)  —   66 Cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges:                        Derivative instruments  (7)  7   (38)  27   —   — Hedged items  3   (7)  38   (27)  —   — Cross-currency swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges:                        Amount of gain (loss) reclassified from accumulated OCI or OCL  (21)  —   (53)  —   51   — Total gain (loss) on hedges recognized in income $(25) $—  $(53) $—  $51  $—  Gain (Loss) on Derivative Instruments Designated as Hedges included in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) or Loss (OCL)   Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2020  2019  2018 Cross-currency swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges $(43) $(105) $88  11.LEASES, OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CERTAIN CONTINGENCIESLeasesWe have operating leases that primarily relate to certain of our facilities, data centers and vehicles. As of May 31, 2020, our operating leases substantially haveremaining terms of one year to twelve years, some of which include options to extend and/or terminate the leases.For fiscal 2020, operating lease expenses totaled $599 million, net of sublease income of $16 million. At May 31, 2020, rOU assets, current lease liabilities andnon-current lease liabilities for our operating leases were $2.0 billion, $575 million and $1.5 billion, respectively. We recorded rOU assets of $2.8 billion inexchange for operating lease obligations during the year ended May 31, 2020, which included $1.9 billion for operating leases existing on June 1, 2019 that wererecognized upon our initial adoption of Topic 842 and $849 million for operating leases that were contracted during fiscal 2020. Cash paid for amounts includedin the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $663 million for year ended May 31, 2020. As of May 31, 2020, the weighted average remaining lease termfor operating leases was approximately six years and the weighted average discount rate used for calculating operating lease obligations was 3.2%. As of May 31,2020, we have $411 million of additional operating lease commitments, primarily for data centers, that commence in fiscal 2021 for terms of one to ten yearsthat are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2020 or in the maturities table below.97Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2020 Maturities of operating lease liabilities were as follows as of May 31, 2020 (in millions): Fiscal 2021 $616 Fiscal 2022  519 Fiscal 2023  350 Fiscal 2024  252 Fiscal 2025  192 Thereafter  386 Total operating lease payments  2,315 Less: imputed interest  (217)Total operating lease liability $2,098 Unconditional ObligationsIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers, which are agreements that are enforceable andlegally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximatetiming of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for our hardware products and to perform final assembly andtesting of finished hardware products. We also obtain individual components for our hardware products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projecteddemand information. Such purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillmentwithin agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amounts disclosedbelow. routine arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are enteredinto in the ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts below, as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiatedterms and are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way.As of May 31, 2020, our unconditional purchase and certain other obligations were as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2021 $881 Fiscal 2022  66 Fiscal 2023  30 Fiscal 2024  27 Fiscal 2025  23 Thereafter  236 Total $1,263  As described in Notes 7 and 10 above, as of May 31, 2020 we have senior notes and other borrowings that mature at various future dates and derivative financialinstruments outstanding that we leverage to manage certain risks and exposures.GuaranteesOur cloud, license and hardware sales agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our products infringe athird party’s intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any materialliabilities related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our sales agreements also include provisions98Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2020 indemnifying customers against liabilities in the event we breach confidentiality or service level requirements. It is not possible to determine the maximumpotential amount under these indemnification agreements due to our limited and infrequent history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts andcircumstances involved in each particular agreement.Our Oracle Cloud Services agreements generally include a warranty that the cloud services will be performed in all material respects as defined in the agreementduring the service period. Our license and hardware agreements also generally include a warranty that our products will substantially operate as described in theapplicable program documentation for a period of one year after delivery. We also warrant that services we perform will be provided in a manner consistent withindustry standards for a period of 90 days from performance of the services.We occasionally are required, for various reasons, to enter into financial guarantees with third parties in the ordinary course of our business including, amongothers, guarantees related to taxes, import licenses and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Such agreements have not had amaterial effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.    In connection with certain litigation, we posted certain court-mandated surety bonds with a court and entered into related indemnification agreements witheach of the surety bond issuing companies. Additional information is provided in Note 17 below.12.STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITYCommon Stock RepurchasesOur Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On September 11, 2019 and March 12, 2020, we announcedthat our Board of Directors approved expansions of our stock repurchase program collectively totaling $30.0 billion. As of May 31, 2020, approximately $16.6billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 361.0 million shares for $19.2 billion, 733.8 millionshares for $36.0 billion, and 238.0 million shares for $11.5 billion in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, under the stock repurchase program.Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capitalneeds, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economicand market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stockrepurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.Dividends on Common StockDuring fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, our Board of Directors declared cash dividends of $0.96, $0.81 and $0.76 per share of our outstanding common stock,respectively, which we paid during the same period.In June 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share of our outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on July 28,2020 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 15, 2020. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and paymentdates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.99Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2020 Accumulated Other Comprehensive LossThe following table summarizes, as of each balance sheet date, the components of our AOCL, net of income taxes:   May 31, (in millions) 2020  2019 Foreign currency translation losses $(1,254) $(1,176)Unrealized losses on defined benefit plans, net  (471)  (392)Unrealized gains (losses) on marketable securities, net  1   (90)Unrealized gains on cash flow hedges, net  8   30 Total accumulated other comprehensive loss $(1,716) $(1,628) 13.EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANSStock-Based Compensation PlansStock PlansIn fiscal 2001, we adopted the 2000 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan, which provides for the issuance of long-term performance awards, including restrictedstock-based awards, non-qualified stock options and incentive stock options, as well as stock purchase rights and stock appreciation rights, to our eligibleemployees, officers and directors who are also employees or consultants, independent consultants and advisers. •In fiscal 2011, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of our Board of Directors (the Board), approved the adoption of the Amended andrestated 2000 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan), which extended the termination date of the 2000 Plan by 10 years and increased thenumber of authorized shares of stock that may be issued by 388,313,015 shares. •In fiscal 2014, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of the Board, approved a further increase in the number of authorized shares of stockthat may be issued under the 2000 Plan by 305,000,000 shares. Under the terms of the 2000 Plan, long-term full value awards are granted in theform of restricted stock units (rSUs) and performance-based restricted stock awards (PSUs). For each share granted as a full value award under the2000 Plan, an equivalent of 2.5 shares is deducted from our pool of shares available for grant. •In fiscal 2018, our stockholders, upon the recommendation of the Board, approved a further increase in the number of authorized shares of stockthat may be issued under the 2000 Plan by 330,000,000 shares, and approved material terms of the performance goals under which PSUs andperformance-based stock options (PSOs) could be granted.As of May 31, 2020, the 2000 Plan had 97 million unvested rSUs outstanding, 54 million PSOs outstanding and service-based stock options (SOs) to purchase 120million shares of common stock outstanding of which 112 million shares were vested. As of May 31, 2020, approximately 212 million shares of common stockwere available for future awards under the 2000 Plan. To date, we have not issued any stock purchase rights or stock appreciation rights under the 2000 Plan.The 2000 Plan is scheduled to expire on the date of Oracle’s annual meeting of stockholders in November 2020.The vesting schedule for all awards granted under the 2000 Plan is established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. rSUs generally requireservice-based vesting of 25% annually over four years. The vesting schedule for PSUs currently requires achieving performance targets and providing service overfour fiscal years. SOs are granted at not less than fair market value, become exercisable generally 25% annually over four years of service, and generally expire 10years from the date of grant. PSOs granted to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer in fiscal 2018 consist of seven numerically equivalentvesting tranches that potentially may100Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2020 vest. One tranche vests solely on the attainment of a market-based metric. The remaining six tranches require the attainment of both a performance metric anda market capitalization metric. In each case, the market-based metric, performance metrics and market capitalization metrics for the PSOs may be achieved atany time during a five year performance period, assuming continued employment and service through the date the Compensation Committee of the Board ofDirectors certifies that performance has been achieved. The PSOs have contractual lives of eight years in comparison to the typical ten year contractual lives forSOs. For the six tranches of the PSOs with both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation expense is to be recognized once each vestingtranche becomes probable of achievement over the longer of the estimated implicit service period or derived service. Stock-based compensation associated witha vesting tranche where vesting is no longer determined to be probable is reversed on a cumulative basis and is no longer prospectively recognized in the periodwhen such a determination is made. We have preliminarily estimated service periods for those tranches that have been deemed probable of achievement to beup to five years. Stock-based compensation for the market-based tranche will be recognized using the derived service period for the market-based metricachievement, which we have initially estimated to be approximately three years.In fiscal 1993, the Board adopted the 1993 Directors’ Stock Plan (the Directors’ Plan), which provides for the issuance of rSUs and other stock-based awards,including non-qualified stock options, to non-employee directors. The Directors’ Plan has from time to time been amended and restated. Under the terms of theDirectors’ Plan, 10 million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance (including a fiscal 2013 amendment to increase the number of shares of ourcommon stock reserved for issuance by 2 million shares). In prior years, we granted stock options at not less than fair market value, that vest over four years, andexpire no more than 10 years from the date of grant. We currently grant rSUs only that vest fully on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant. The Directors’Plan was most recently amended on April 29, 2016 and permits the Compensation Committee of the Board to determine the amount and form of automaticgrants of stock awards, if any, to each non-employee director upon first becoming a director and thereafter on an annual basis, as well as automatic grants forchairing certain Board committees, subject to certain stockholder approved limitations set forth in the Directors’ Plan. In April 2020, the CompensationCommittee reduced the maximum value of the annual automatic rSU grants to each non-employee director from $400,000 to $350,000 and eliminated all equitygrants for chairing board committees. As of May 31, 2020, approximately 81,000 unvested rSUs and stock options to purchase approximately 1 million shares ofcommon stock (all of which were vested) were outstanding under the Directors’ Plan. As of May 31, 2020, approximately 1 million shares were available forfuture stock awards under this plan.In connection with certain of our acquisitions, we assumed certain outstanding restricted stock-based awards and stock options under each acquired company’srespective stock plans, or we substituted substantially similar awards under the 2000 Plan. These restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed orsubstituted generally retain all of the rights, terms and conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally granted. As of May 31, 2020, stockoptions to purchase approximately 1 million shares of common stock were outstanding under acquired company stock plans that Oracle assumed.101Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2020 The following table summarizes restricted stock-based award activity, including service-based awards and performance-based awards, granted pursuant toOracle-based stock plans and stock plans assumed from our acquisitions for our last three fiscal years ended May 31, 2020:   Restricted Stock-Based Awards Outstanding (in millions, except fair value) Number ofShares  Weighted-AverageGrant Date Fair Value Balance, May 31, 2017  83  $39.18 Granted  44  $47.42 Vested and Issued  (27) $39.10 Canceled  (11) $41.97 Balance, May 31, 2018  89  $42.93 Granted  53  $42.47 Vested and Issued  (31) $41.85 Canceled  (12) $42.97 Balance, May 31, 2019  99  $43.01 Granted  50  $53.38 Vested and Issued  (34) $42.67 Canceled  (14) $46.81 Balance, May 31, 2020  101  $48.36  The total grant date fair value of restricted stock-based awards that were vested and issued in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $1.5 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.0billion, respectively. As of May 31, 2020, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock-based awards was $3.2billion and is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 2.72 years.No PSUs were granted in fiscal 2020, 2019 or 2018. In fiscal 2017, PSUs were granted that vest upon the attainment of certain performance metrics and service-based vesting.

Approximately 49 million shares outstanding as of May 31, 2020 were not expected to vest.Stock-Based Compensation Expense and Valuations of Stock AwardsWe estimated the fair values of our restricted stock-based awards that are solely subject to service-based vesting requirements based upon their market valuesas of the grant dates, discounted for the present values of expected dividends.Stock-based compensation expense was included in the following operating expense line items in our consolidated statements of operations:103Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2020    Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2020  2019  2018 Cloud services and license support $110  $99  $82 Hardware  11   10   10 Services  54   49   52 Sales and marketing  261   360   361 research and development  1,035   963   921 General and administrative  119   172   180 Acquisition related and other  —   —   1 Total stock-based compensation  1,590   1,653   1,607 Estimated income tax benefit included in provision for income taxes  (343)  (358)  (451)Total stock-based compensation, net of estimated income tax benefit $1,247  $1,295  $1,156  Tax Benefits from Exercises of Stock Options and Vesting of Restricted Stock-Based AwardsTotal cash received as a result of option exercises was approximately $1.5 billion, $2.0 billion and $2.3 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Thetotal aggregate intrinsic value of restricted stock-based awards that vested and were issued and stock options that were exercised was $2.9 billion, $3.1 billionand $3.0 billion for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In connection with the vesting and issuance of restricted stock-based awards and stock options thatwere exercised, the tax benefits realized by us were $638 million, $692 million and $860 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.Employee Stock Purchase PlanWe have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan) that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 95% of the fairmarket value of Oracle stock as of the end of the semi-annual option period. As of May 31, 2020, 44 million shares were reserved for future issuances under thePurchase Plan. We issued 2 million shares in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively, and 3 million shares in fiscal 2018 under the Purchase Plan.Defined Contribution and Other Postretirement PlansWe offer various defined contribution plans for our U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution plan expense was $376 million, $380 million and$384 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.In the U.S., regular employees can participate in the Oracle Corporation 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan (Oracle 401(k) Plan). Participants can generallycontribute up to 40% of their eligible compensation on a per-pay-period basis as defined by the Oracle 401(k) Plan document or by the section 402(g) limit asdefined by the U.S. Internal revenue Service (IrS). We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 50% up to 6% of compensation each pay period,subject to maximum aggregate matching amounts. Our contributions to the Oracle 401(k) Plan, net of forfeitures, were $152 million, $154 million and $151million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.We also offer non-qualified deferred compensation plans to certain employees whereby they may defer a portion of their annual base and/or variablecompensation until retirement or a date specified by the employee in accordance with the plans. Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities were eachapproximately $636 million and approximately $566 million as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and were presented in other non-current assets and othernon-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.104Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2020 We sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans that are offered primarily by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans were assumed throughour acquisitions or are required by local regulatory requirements. We may deposit funds for these plans with insurance companies, third-party trustees, or intogovernment-managed accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as applicable. Our total defined benefit plan pension expenses were $97 million,$90 million and $102 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate net liability (funded status) ofour defined benefit plans as of May 31, 2020 were $1.3 billion and $884 million, respectively, and as of May 31, 2019 were $1.2 billion and $821 million,respectively.14.INCOME TAXESOur effective tax rates for each of the periods presented are the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of incometax rates. Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2020 varied from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to earnings inforeign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, theForeign Derived Intangible Income deduction and the tax effect of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). During fiscal 2019, we recorded a net benefit of$389 million in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118) related to adjustments in our estimates of the one-time transition tax on certainforeign subsidiary earnings, and the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets and liabilities affected by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act).Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2019 varied from the 21% U.S. statutory rate imposed by the Tax Act primarily due to earnings in foreign operations,state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the Foreign DerivedIntangible Income deduction, GILTI, and the aforementioned $389 million net reduction to our transition tax recorded consistent with the provision of SAB 118.Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2018 varied from the 21% U.S. statutory rate imposed by the Tax Act primarily due to the impacts of the Tax Act uponour adoption date of January 1, 2018 including the impacts of the transition tax, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with taxauthorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction.The following is a geographical breakdown of income before the provision for income taxes:   Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2020  2019  2018 Domestic $3,890  $3,774  $3,366 Foreign  8,173   8,494   9,058 Income before provision for income taxes $12,063  $12,268  $12,424  105Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2020 The provision for income taxes consisted of the following:   Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2020  2019  2018 Current provision:            Federal $1,616  $979  $8,320 State  19   300   264 Foreign  1,144   1,097   1,100 Total current provision $2,779  $2,376  $9,684 Deferred benefit:            Federal $(983) $483  $(827)State  50   (28)  (26)Foreign  82   (1,646)  6 Total deferred benefit $(851) $(1,191) $(847)Total provision for income taxes $1,928  $1,185  $8,837 Effective income tax rate 16.0%  9.7%  71.1%  The provision for income taxes differed from the amount computed by applying the federal statutory rate to our income before provision for income taxes asfollows (certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation):   Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2020  2019  2018 U.S. federal statutory tax rate 21.0%  21.0%  29.2% Tax provision at statutory rate $2,533  $2,576  $3,629 Impact of the Tax Act of 2017:            One-time transition tax  —   (529)  7,781 Deferred tax effects  —   140   (911)Foreign earnings at other than United States rates  (496)  (1,053)  (1,132)State tax expense, net of federal benefit  172   163   121 Settlements and releases from judicial decisions and statute expirations, net  (137)  (132)  (252)Tax contingency interest accrual, net  163   245   105 Domestic production activity deduction  —   —   (87)Federal research and development credit  (151)  (159)  (174)Stock-based compensation  (166)  (201)  (302)Other, net  10   135   59 Total provision for income taxes $1,928  $1,185  $8,837  106Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2020 The components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:   May 31, (in millions) 2020  2019 Deferred tax assets:        Accruals and allowances $469  $541 Employee compensation and benefits  638   646 Differences in timing of revenue recognition  524   322 Lease liabilities  253   — Basis of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets  1,115   1,238 Tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards  3,871   3,717 Total deferred tax assets  6,870   6,464 Valuation allowance  (1,359)  (1,266)Total deferred tax assets, net  5,511   5,198 Deferred tax liabilities:        Unrealized gain on stock  (78)  (78)Acquired intangible assets  (561)  (973)GILTI deferred  (1,108)  (1,515)rOU assets  (241)  — Withholding taxes on foreign earnings  (171)  (91)Other  (141)  (109)Total deferred tax liabilities  (2,300)  (2,766)Net deferred tax assets $3,211  $2,432 recorded as:        Non-current deferred tax assets $3,252  $2,696 Non-current deferred tax liabilities (in other non-current liabilities)  (41)  (264)Net deferred tax assets $3,211  $2,432  We provide for taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We do not provide for taxes on other outside basis temporary differences of foreignsubsidiaries as they are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. At May 31, 2020, the amount of temporary differences related to other outside basistemporary differences of investments in foreign subsidiaries upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided was approximately $7.9 billion. If the otheroutside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction, they would generate foreign tax credits that would reduce the federal tax liability associatedwith the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. At May 31, 2020, assuming a full utilization of the foreign tax credits, the potential net deferredtax liability associated with these other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately $1.5 billion.Our net deferred tax assets were $3.2 billion and $2.4 billion as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We believe that it is more likely than not that the netdeferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxableincome in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and taxcredit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable incomechange.107Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2020 The valuation allowance was $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A majority of the valuation allowances as of May 31, 2020and 2019 related to tax assets established in purchase accounting and other tax credits. Any subsequent reduction of that portion of the valuation allowance andthe recognition of the associated tax benefits associated with our acquisitions will be recorded to our provision for income taxes subsequent to our finaldetermination of the valuation allowance or the conclusion of the measurement period (as defined above), whichever comes first.At May 31, 2020, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $597 million, which are subject to limitation on their utilization.Approximately $537 million of these federal net operating losses expire in various years between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2038. Approximately $60 million of thesefederal net operating losses are not currently subject to expiration dates. We had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.0 billion at May 31,2020, which expire between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2038 and are subject to limitations on their utilization. We had total foreign net operating loss carryforwards ofapproximately $1.9 billion at May 31, 2020, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $1.7 billion of these foreign net operating lossesare not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the foreign net operating losses, approximately $133 million, expire between fiscal 2021 and fiscal2040. We had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1.1 billion at May 31, 2020, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $741million of these tax credit carryforwards are not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the tax credit carryforwards, approximately $357 million,expire in various years between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2038.We classify our unrecognized tax benefits as either current or non-current income taxes payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Theaggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits, including acquisitions, were as follows:   Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2020  2019  2018 Gross unrecognized tax benefits as of June 1 $6,348  $5,592  $4,919 Increases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years  624   772   200 Decreases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years  (298)  (135)  (65)Increases related to tax positions taken during current fiscal year  628   540   840 Settlements with tax authorities  (177)  (153)  (42)Lapses of statutes of limitation  (116)  (202)  (273)Cumulative translation adjustments and other, net  (37)  (66)  13 Total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of May 31 $6,972  $6,348  $5,592  As of May 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, $4.3 billion, $4.2 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits would affect our effective tax rate ifrecognized. We recognized interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements ofoperations of $202 million, $312 million and $127 million during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of May 31, 2020 and2019 were $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.Domestically, U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal2017. Many issues are at an advanced stage in the examination process, the most significant of which include the deductibility of certain royalty payments,transfer pricing, extraterritorial income exemptions, domestic production activity, foreign tax credits, and research and development credits taken. With all ofthese domestic audit issues considered in the aggregate, we believe that it was reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2020, the gross unrecognized tax benefitsrelated to these audits could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $1.1 billion ($1.0 billion netof offsetting tax benefits). Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2010 and we are no longer subject to audit forthose periods. Our U.S. state income tax returns, with108Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2020 some exceptions, have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2007 and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods.Internationally, tax authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining returns affecting our unrecognized tax benefits. We believe that it wasreasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2020, the gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) by asmuch as $105 million ($42 million net of offsetting tax benefits) in the next 12 months related primarily to transfer pricing. With some exceptions, we aregenerally no longer subject to tax examinations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 2001.We believe that we have adequately provided under GAAP for outcomes related to our tax audits. However, there can be no assurances as to the possibleoutcomes or any related financial statement effect thereof. On June 22, 2020 the U.S. Supreme Court declined a Writ of Certiorari in the case of Altera Corp vsCommissioner challenging a decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (which itself reversed a previous decision of the U.S. Tax Court) holding that the U.S.Treasury Department’s regulations requiring the inclusion of stock-based compensation expense in a taxpayer’s cost-sharing calculations were valid. Ourconsolidated financial statements have been prepared consistent with this outcome, and accordingly no adjustments will be required as the result of thisdevelopment.We are under audit by the IrS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved invarious challenges and litigation in a number of countries, including, in particular, Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, Indonesia, Israel, South Korea, Mexico,Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Spain, where the amounts under controversy are significant. In some, although not all cases, we have reserved for potentialadjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these taxauthorities or final outcomes in judicial proceedings, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings will nothave a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities wouldresult in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign incometax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, it could result in a further charge to expense.109Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2020 15.SEGMENT INFORMATIONASC 280, Segment Reporting, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of anenterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, indeciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision makers (CODMs) are our Chief Executive Officer and ChiefTechnology Officer. We are organized by line of business and geographically. While our CODMs evaluate results in a number of different ways, the line ofbusiness management structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed. The tabular information belowpresents the financial information provided to our CODMs for their review and assists our CODMs with evaluating the company’s performance and allocatingcompany resources.We have three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—each of which is comprised of a single operating segment. All three of our businessesmarket and sell our offerings globally to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers with a worldwide sales forcepositioned to offer the combinations that best meet customer needs.Our cloud and license business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our applications and infrastructure technologies through cloud and on-premisedeployment models including our cloud services and license support offerings; and our cloud license and on-premise license offerings. Cloud services and licensesupport revenues are generated from offerings that are typically contracted with customers directly, billed to customers in advance, delivered to customers overtime with our revenue recognition occurring over the contractual terms, and renewed by customers upon completion of the contractual terms. Cloud servicesand license support contracts provide customers with access to the latest updates to the applications and infrastructure technologies as they become availableand for which the customer contracted and also include related technical support services over the contractual term. Cloud license and on-premise licenserevenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applicationssoftware products within cloud and on-premise IT environments. We generally recognize revenues at the point in time the software is made available to thecustomer to download and use, which typically is immediate upon signature of the license contract. In each fiscal year, our cloud and license business’contractual activities are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and the related cash flows are typically highest in the following quarter (i.e., in the first fiscalquarter of the next fiscal year) as we receive payments from these contracts.Our hardware business provides Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware, operating systems, virtualization, management andother hardware-related software to support diverse IT environments. Our hardware business also offers hardware support, which provides customers withsoftware updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of their hardware products, such as Oracle Solaris and certain othersoftware, and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services.Our services business provides services to customers and partners to help maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications andinfrastructure technologies.We do not track our assets for each business.

The principal category we use to disaggregate revenues is the nature of our products and services aspresented in our consolidated statements of operations, the total of which is reconciled to revenues from our reportable segments as per the preceding tables ofthis footnote.The following table is a summary of our total revenues by geographic region. The relative proportion of our total revenues between each geographic region aspresented in the table below was materially consistent across each of our operating segments’ revenues for each of fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018:  Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2020  2019  2018 Americas $21,563  $21,856  $21,648 EMEA(1)  11,035   11,270   11,409 Asia Pacific  6,470   6,380   6,326 Total revenues $39,068  $39,506  $39,383  (1)Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa  112Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2020 The following table presents our cloud services and license support revenues by applications and infrastructure ecosystems.  Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2020  2019  2018 Applications cloud services and license support $11,015  $10,553  $10,038 Infrastructure cloud services and license support  16,377   16,154   16,184 Total cloud services and license support revenues $27,392  $26,707  $26,222  Geographic InformationDisclosed in the table below is geographic information for each country that comprised greater than three percent of our total revenues for any of fiscal 2020,2019 or 2018.   As of and for the Year Ended May 31,   2020  2019  2018 (in millions) Revenues  Long-LivedAssets(1)  Revenues  Long-LivedAssets(1)  Revenues  Long-LivedAssets(1) United States $18,428  $6,012  $18,596  $5,318  $18,330  $4,976 Japan  1,977   655   1,848   422   1,716   388 United Kingdom  1,904   472   2,054   423   2,093   510 Germany  1,510   418   1,583   263   1,526   179 Canada  1,162   169   1,166   87   1,200   78 Other countries  14,087   1,977   14,259   1,356   14,518   1,223 Total $39,068  $9,703  $39,506  $7,869  $39,383  $7,354  (1)Long-lived assets exclude goodwill, intangible assets, equity investments and deferred taxes, which are not allocated to specific geographic locations as it is impracticable to do so.16.EARNINGS PER SHAREBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted‑average number of common shares outstanding during the period,plus the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock-based awards, stock options, and shares issuable under the employee stock purchase plan as applicablepursuant to the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:   Year Ended May 31, (in millions, except per share data) 2020  2019  2018 Net income $10,135  $11,083  $3,587 Weighted average common shares outstanding  3,211   3,634   4,121 Dilutive effect of employee stock plans  83   98   117 Dilutive weighted average common shares outstanding  3,294   3,732   4,238 Basic earnings per share $3.16  $3.05  $0.87 Diluted earnings per share $3.08  $2.97  $0.85 Shares subject to anti-dilutive restricted stock-based awards and stock options excluded from calculation(1)  56   71   64  (1)These weighted shares relate to anti-dilutive restricted service based stock‑based awards and stock options as calculated using the treasury stock method and contingently issuable shares under PSOand PSU agreements. Such shares could be dilutive in the future. See Note 13 for information regarding the exercise prices of our outstanding, unexercised stock options.113Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2020 17.LEGAL PROCEEDINGSHewlett-Packard Company LitigationOn June 15, 2011, Hewlett-Packard Company, now Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HP), filed a complaint in the California Superior Court, County of SantaClara against Oracle Corporation alleging numerous causes of action including breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing,defamation, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and violation of the California Unfair Business Practices Act. The complaint allegedthat when Oracle announced on March 22 and 23, 2011 that it would no longer develop future versions of its software to run on HP’s Itanium-based servers, itbreached a settlement agreement signed on September 20, 2010 (the HP Settlement Agreement), resolving litigation between HP and one of Oracle’s formerCEOs who had previously acted as HP’s chief executive officer and chairman of HP’s board of directors. HP sought a judicial declaration of the parties’ rights andobligations under the HP Settlement Agreement and other equitable and monetary relief. Oracle answered the complaint and filed cross-claims.After a bench trial on the meaning of the HP Settlement Agreement, the court found that the HP Settlement Agreement required Oracle to continue to developcertain of its software products for use on HP’s Itanium-based servers at no cost to HP. The case proceeded to a jury trial in May 2016. On June 30, 2016, the juryreturned a verdict in favor of HP on its claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and against Oracle on itscross-claims. The jury awarded HP $3.0 billion in damages. Under the court’s rulings, HP is entitled to post-judgment interest, but not pre-judgment interest, onthis award.After the trial court denied Oracle’s motion for a new trial, Oracle filed a notice of appeal on January 17, 2017. On February 2, 2017, HP filed a notice of appeal ofthe trial court’s denial of pre-judgment interest.Oracle has posted a mandated surety bond with the trial court for the amounts owing. No amounts have been paid or recorded to our results of operations. Wecontinue to believe that we have meritorious defenses against HP’s claims, and we intend to present these defenses to the appellate court. Oracle filed itsopening brief on March 7, 2019. Briefing on the appeal was completed November 1, 2019, and the appellate court has not scheduled a date for oral argument.We cannot currently estimate a reasonably possible range of loss for this action due to the complexities and uncertainty surrounding the appeal process and thenature of the claims. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome of the appeal process related to this action is uncertain. It is possible that theresolution of this action could have a material impact on our future cash flows and results of operations.Derivative Litigation Concerning Oracle’s NetSuite AcquisitionOn May 3 and July 18, 2017, two alleged stockholders filed separate derivative lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, purportedly onOracle’s behalf. Thereafter, the court consolidated the two derivative cases and designated the July 18, 2017 complaint as the operative complaint. Theconsolidated lawsuit was brought against all the then-current members and one former member of our Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant.Plaintiff alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite Inc. (NetSuite) at an excessive price. Plaintiffseeks declaratory relief, unspecified monetary damages (including interest), and attorneys’ fees and costs. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which thecourt denied on March 19, 2018.On May 4, 2018, the Board of Directors established a Special Litigation Committee (the SLC) to investigate the allegations in this derivative action. Three non-employee directors served on the SLC. On August 15, 2019, the SLC filed a letter with the court, stating that the SLC believed that plaintiff should be allowed toproceed with the derivative litigation on behalf of Oracle. After the SLC advised the Board that it had fulfilled its duties and obligations, the Board withdrew theSLC’s authority, except that the SLC maintained certain authority to respond to discovery requests in the litigation.114Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2020 After plaintiff filed its initial complaint, plaintiff filed several amended complaints. Plaintiff filed its most recent amended complaint on February 18, 2020. Thecomplaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty against our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Technology Officer, the estate of Mark Hurd (our former ChiefExecutive Officer who passed away on October 18, 2019), and two other members of our Board of Directors. Oracle is named as a nominal defendant. Thecomplaint also asserts an aiding-and-abetting claim against NetSuite’s former Chief Executive Officer and NetSuite’s former Chief Technology Officer. The twoformer NetSuite officers moved to dismiss the complaint, and the court held a hearing on that motion on March 11, 2020. The court has not yet ruled on thatmotion. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer answered the latest complaint on March 3, 2020, and Oracle filed an answer on the same day.On February 20, 2020, the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss. No hearing has been scheduled for this motion.On April 20, 2020, after our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer indicated that they might challenge plaintiff’s standing to pursue this matter, anadditional plaintiff moved to intervene in this case. On April 29, 2020, the court granted that plaintiff’s motion to intervene. On May 7, 2020, our Chief ExecutiveOfficer and Chief Technology Officer filed a motion for summary judgment, seeking to have the plaintiff that filed the July 18, 2017 complaint dismissed from thecase for lack of standing, arguing that this plaintiff had not continuously owned Oracle stock during the relevant time period. This motion is scheduled for oralargument on July 9, 2020.While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, we do not believe this litigation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.Securities Class Action and Derivative Litigation Concerning Oracle’s Cloud BusinessOn August 10, 2018, a putative class action, brought by an alleged stockholder of Oracle, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Californiaagainst us, our Chief Technology Officer, our then-two Chief Executive Officers, two other Oracle executives, and one former Oracle executive. As noted above,Mr. Hurd, one of our then-two Chief Executive Officers, passed away on October 18, 2019. On March 8, 2019, plaintiff filed an amended complaint. Plaintiffalleges that the defendants made or are responsible for false and misleading statements regarding Oracle’s cloud business. Plaintiff further alleges that theformer Oracle executive engaged in insider trading. Plaintiff seeks a ruling that this case may proceed as a class action, and seeks damages, attorneys’ fees andcosts, and unspecified declaratory/injunctive relief. On April 19, 2019, defendants moved to dismiss plaintiff’s amended complaint. On December 17, 2019, thecourt granted this motion, giving plaintiffs an opportunity to file an amended complaint, which plaintiff filed on February 17, 2020. On April 23, 2020, defendantsfiled a motion to dismiss, which is scheduled for hearing on September 24, 2020. We believe that we have meritorious defenses against this action, and we willcontinue to vigorously defend it.On February 12, 2019, a stockholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The derivative suit is brought bytwo alleged stockholders of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle’s behalf, against all members of our Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant. Plaintiffsclaim that the alleged actions described in the August 10, 2018 class action discussed above caused harm to Oracle, and that Oracle’s Board members violatedtheir fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, reasonable inquiry, and good faith by failing to prevent this alleged harm. Plaintiffs also allege that defendants’ actionsconstitute gross mismanagement, waste, and securities fraud. Plaintiffs seek a ruling that this case may proceed as a derivative action, a finding that defendantsare liable for breaching their fiduciary duties, an order directing defendants to enact corporate reforms, attorneys’ fees and costs, and unspecified equitablerelief. On April 26, 2019, the court approved a stay of this action, which will be lifted if the class action discussed above is dismissed, if the motion to dismiss theclass action is denied, or if either party voluntarily chooses to lift the stay.On May 8, 2019, a second derivative action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The derivative suit is brought by an allegedstockholder of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle’s behalf, against our Chief Technology Officer, our then-two Chief Executive Officers, one former Oracle executive,and Oracle as a nominal defendant. Plaintiff claims that the alleged actions described in the August 10, 2018 class115Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2020 action discussed above caused harm to Oracle, and plaintiff raises further allegations of impropriety relating to Oracle’s stock buybacks and acquisition ofNetSuite. Plaintiff asserts claims for violation of securities laws, violation of fiduciary duties, contribution and indemnification. Plaintiff seeks a ruling that thecase may proceed as a derivative action, and seeks damages, declaratory and other equitable relief, attorneys’ and expert fees and costs. On June 4, 2019, thecourt issued an order finding that this case was related to the derivative case above and staying the case under the court’s prior stay order. On July 8, 2019,plaintiffs in the two derivative actions filed a consolidated complaint. The actions remain stayed.  While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, we do not believe this litigation will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.Other LitigationWe are party to various other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedingsand claims that relate to acquisitions we have completed or to companies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire. While the outcome of these matterscannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that arematerially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any. 116Table of Contents Index to Financial Statements SCHEDULE IIORACLE CORPORATIONVALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS (in millions) BeginningBalance  AdditionsCharged toOperations orOther Accounts  Write-offs  TranslationAdjustmentsand Other  EndingBalance Allowances for Doubtful Trade receivables                    Year Ended:                    May 31, 2018 $319  $146  $(98) $3  $370 May 31, 2019 $370  $190  $(188) $(1) $371 May 31, 2020 $371  $245  $(195) $(12) $409   Item 16.Form 10-K Summary None. 117
