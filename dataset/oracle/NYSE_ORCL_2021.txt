The constant currency increase in our cloud and licensebusiness’ revenues during fiscal 2021 was offset by decreases in our hardware business’ revenues and services business’ revenues. The constant currencyincrease in our cloud and license business’ revenues during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 was attributable to growth in our cloud services and license supportrevenues and growth in our cloud license and on-premise license revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloudand license deployment models and renewed their related cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gain access to the latest versions of ourtechnologies and to receive support services. The constant currency decrease in our hardware business’ revenues during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 wasdue to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our growing cloud-based infrastructure technologies and the de-emphasis of our sales andmarketing efforts for certain of our  non-strategic hardware products and related support services. The constant currency decrease in our services business’revenues during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to a decline in our consulting revenues. All three of our businesses’ revenues wereadversely impacted during fiscal 2021 and 2020 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and some of these effects may continue into fiscal 2022. While weexpect these effects to be temporary, the impacts of COVID-19 for future periods are unknown. In constant currency, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacificregions contributed 54%, 39% and 7%, respectively, to the growth in our total revenues during fiscal 2021.44Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total operating expenses decreased during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lowersales and marketing expenses, lower hardware expenses and lower services expenses, all of which were primarily attributable to lower headcount and areduction in certain variable expenditures as further described below. In addition, we also incurred lower amortization of intangible assets during fiscal 2021.These constant currency expense decreases were partially offset by certain constant currency expense increases during fiscal 2021, primarily: higher cloudservices and license support expenses, which increased primarily due to higher infrastructure investments that were made to support the increase in our cloudand license business’ revenues; higher research and development and general and administrative expenses, each of which increased primarily due to higheremployee related expenses; higher acquisition related and other expenses, which increased primarily due to certain right-of-use assets and other assets thatwere abandoned in connection with plans to improve our cost structure and operations; and higher restructuring expenses, which increased due to actions takenduring fiscal 2021 pursuant to the Fiscal 2019 Oracle restructuring Plan (2019 restructuring Plan). During fiscal 2021 and 2020, we curtailed a number of variableexpenditures across all of our lines of businesses and functions including employee travel expenses and marketing expenses, among others, primarily in responseto COVID-19. We expect certain of these expenses may normalize in future periods provided global economic and health conditions improve.In constant currency, our total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues increased in fiscal 2021 due to higher totalrevenues and lower total operating expenses. In fiscal 2022, we expect to accelerate our investments primarily in our cloud and license business. We expect fiscal2022 total expenses growth to exceed total revenues growth and, as a result, our fiscal 2022 total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues to bemodestly lower relative to fiscal 2021.Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain ChargesTo supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe that the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financialperformance and prospects for the future.Our operating results reported pursuant to GAAP included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions andcertain other expense and income items that affected our GAAP net income:   Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2021  2020 Cloud services and license support deferred revenues(1) $2  $4 Amortization of intangible assets(2)  1,379   1,586 Acquisition related and other(3)  138   56 restructuring(4)  431   250 Stock-based compensation, operating segments(5)  513   436 Stock-based compensation, r&D and G&A(5)  1,324   1,154 Income tax effects(6)  (3,408)  (939)  $379  $2,547 45Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements   (1)In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support contracts assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, wedid not recognize the cloud services and license support revenue amounts as presented in the above table that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entitiesupon delivery of the contractual obligations. To the extent customers for which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the fullcontracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods.(2)represents the amortization of intangible assets, substantially all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions.

Our cloud servicesdeliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspecified updatesand enhancements for, deploy, host, manage and support. revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized over the contractual term, which is generallyone to three years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent feesearned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products withincloud and on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer todownload and use. We continue46Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market certain of ourofferings through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services and license support expenses, and salesand marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud services and license supportofferings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings, and marketing program costs.   Year Ended May 31,       Percent Change    (Dollars in millions) 2021  Actual Constant 2020 Cloud and License Revenues:            Americas(1) $18,783  3% 3% $18,314 EMEA  9,928  10% 4%  9,058 Asia Pacific  5,390  5% 1%  5,151 Total revenues(1)  34,101  5% 3%  32,523 Expenses:            Cloud services and license support(2)  4,133  9% 7%  3,803 Sales and marketing(2)  6,799  -5% -6%  7,159 Total expenses(2)  10,932  0% -2%  10,962 Total Margin $23,169  7% 5% $21,561 Total Margin % 68%      66% % Revenues by Geography:            Americas 55%      56% EMEA 29%      28% Asia Pacific 16%      16% Revenues by Offerings:            Cloud services and license support(1) $28,702  5% 3% $27,396 Cloud license and on-premise license  5,399  5% 2%  5,127 Total revenues(1) $34,101  5% 3% $32,523 Cloud Services and License Support Revenues by Ecosystem:            Applications cloud services and license support(1) $11,713  6% 5% $11,019 Infrastructure cloud services and license support(1)  16,989  4% 2%  16,377 Total cloud services and license support revenues(1) $28,702  5% 3% $27,396 (1)Includes cloud services and license support revenue adjustments related to certain cloud services and license support contracts that would have otherwise been recorded as revenues by the acquiredbusinesses as independent entities but were not recognized in our GAAP-based consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented due to business combination accounting requirements.Such revenue adjustments were included in our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs. See “Presentation of Operating Segment results and Other FinancialInformation” above for additional information.(2)Excludes stock-based compensation and certain expense allocations. Also excludes amortization of intangible assets and certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operatingsegment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segment results and Other Financial Information” above.Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total revenues increased in fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 due togrowth in our cloud services and license support revenues and cloud license and on-premise license revenues as customers purchased our applications andinfrastructure technologies via cloud and license deployment models and renewed their related cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gainaccess to the latest versions of our technologies and to receive support for which we delivered such cloud and support services during fiscal 2021. The growth inour cloud and license business’ revenues were adversely impacted during fiscal 2021 and 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impacts of COVID-19 forfuture periods are unknown. In constant currency, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 57%, 38% and 5%, respectively, of the constantcurrency revenue growth for this business in fiscal 2021.In constant currency, our total cloud and license business’ expenses decreased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to lower sales and marketing expenses,which decreased primarily due to lower employee related expenses and our curtailment of variable expenditures, including lower employee travel expenses andlower47Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements marketing expenses, primarily in response to COVID-19. These constant currency expense decreases were partially offset by higher cloud services and licensesupport expenses during fiscal 2021, which were primarily attributable to higher technology infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud andlicense business’ revenues. Our cloud services and license support expenses have grown in recent periods and, in fiscal 2022, we expect this growth to accelerateas we increase our existing data center capacity and establish data centers in new geographic locations in order to meet current and expected customer demand.Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues increased infiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to the fiscal 2021 increases in total revenues and the decreases in total expenses for this business.Hardware BusinessOur hardware business’ revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, server, storage, and industry-specific hardware offerings. Thehardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as acombined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardwareproduct is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardwaresupport contracts purchased by our customers at their option and that are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services aredelivered over the contractual term, which is generally one year. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independentdistributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with ourhardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internalmanufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact ofinventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide supportservices; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of ourhardware offerings.   Year Ended May 31,       Percent Change    (Dollars in millions) 2021  Actual Constant 2020 Hardware Revenues:            Americas $1,650  -6% -6% $1,758 EMEA  989  -1% -4%  998 Asia Pacific  720  5% 1%  687 Total revenues  3,359  -2% -4%  3,443 Expenses:            Hardware products and support(1)  945  -13% -14%  1,084 Sales and marketing(1)  388  -15% -16%  456 Total expenses(1)  1,333  -13% -14%  1,540 Total Margin $2,026  6% 5% $1,903 Total Margin % 60%      55% % Revenues by Geography:            Americas 49%      51% EMEA 30%      29% Asia Pacific 21%      20% (1)Excludes stock-based compensation and certain expense allocations.

Our services business revenues were also adversely impacted during fiscal 2021 and 2020 by the impacts of COVID-19, including the impactsof consulting project delays due to customer resource constraints and in-person meeting restrictions imposed by certain jurisdictions. In addition, we incurredlower billable travel expenses and lower billable sub-contractor expenses for which we would have been reimbursed by our customers, which reduced theamount of revenues and expenses we reported for our services business during fiscal 2021 and 2020. Geographically, we experienced constant currency revenuedeclines in all regions during fiscal 2021.In constant currency, total services expenses decreased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower employee related costs caused by lowerheadcount in addition to lower travel and sub-contractor expenses as described above.

In addition, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2021 wereunfavorably affected in comparison to the prior year due to a $29 million litigation related benefit that reduced our expenses during fiscal 2020.Amortization of Intangible Assets:   Substantially all of our intangible assets were acquired through our business combinations. We amortize our intangibleassets over, and monitor the appropriateness of, the estimated useful lives of these assets. We also periodically review these intangible assets for potentialimpairment based upon relevant facts and circumstances. Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report hasadditional information regarding our intangible assets and related amortization.   Year Ended May 31,       Percent Change    (Dollars in millions) 2021  Actual Constant 2020 Developed technology $621  -21% -22% $789 Cloud services and license support agreements and related relationships  669  -1% -2%  676 Other  89  -27% -27%  121 Total amortization of intangible assets $1,379  -13% -14% $1,586 50Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements  Amortization of intangible assets decreased in fiscal 2021 due to a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fullyamortized, partially offset by a smaller amount of additional amortization from intangible assets that we acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions.Acquisition Related and Other Expenses:   Acquisition related and other expenses primarily consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain otheremployees, certain business combination adjustments, including adjustments after the measurement period has ended, and certain other operating items, net.   Year Ended May 31,       Percent Change    (Dollars in millions) 2021  Actual Constant 2020 Transitional and other employee related costs $5  -58% -59% $12 Business combination adjustments, net  4  * *  (7)Other, net  129  153% 152%  51 Total acquisition related and other expenses $138  147% 145% $56  *Not meaningful On a constant currency basis, acquisition related and other expenses increased during fiscal 2021 due to higher other expenses, net which primarily related tocertain facilities-related right-of-use assets and certain other assets that were abandoned in connection with plans to improve our cost structure and operationsduring fiscal 2021.Restructuring Expenses: restructuring expenses resulted from the execution of management approved restructuring plans that were generally developed toimprove our cost structure and/or operations, often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies and/or other strategic initiatives. restructuringexpenses consist of employee severance costs and other contract termination costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. For additional informationregarding our restructuring plans, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report.   Year Ended May 31,       Percent Change    (Dollars in millions) 2021  Actual Constant 2020 restructuring expenses $431  73% 66% $250 restructuring expenses in fiscal 2021 and 2020 primarily related to our 2019 restructuring Plan, which is substantially complete. Our management approved,committed to and initiated the 2019 restructuring Plan in order to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations. We may incur additionalrestructuring expenses in future periods due to the initiation of new restructuring plans or from changes in estimated costs associated with existing restructuringplans.The majority of the initiatives undertaken by our 2019 restructuring Plan were effected to implement our continued emphasis in developing, marketing andselling our cloud-based offerings. These initiatives impacted certain of our sales and marketing and research and development operations. Certain of the costsavings realized pursuant to our 2019 restructuring Plan initiatives were offset by investments in resources and geographies that better address thedevelopment, marketing, sale and delivery of our cloud‑based offerings including investments in our second‑generation cloud infrastructure.Interest Expense:   Year Ended May 31,       Percent Change    (Dollars in millions) 2021  Actual Constant 2020 Interest expense $2,496  25% 25% $1,995 51Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements  Interest expense increased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 substantially due to higher average borrowings resulting from our issuance of $15.0 billion ofsenior notes in March 2021 and $20.0 billion of senior notes in March 2020.Non-Operating Income, net: Non-operating income, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange losses, the noncontrolling interestsin the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (primarily Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Corporation Japan) and net other incomeand expenses, including net realized gains and losses related to all of our investments, net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of ourinvestment portfolio related to our deferred compensation plan, net unrealized gains and losses related to equity securities and non-service net periodic pensionincome and losses.   Year Ended May 31,       Percent Change    (Dollars in millions) 2021  Actual Constant 2020 Interest income $101  -81% -81% $527 Foreign currency losses, net  (112) -40% -45%  (185)Noncontrolling interests in income  (180) 10% 10%  (164)Other, net  473  * *  (16)Total non-operating income, net $282  74% 95% $162  *Not meaningful Our non-operating income, net increased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher other income, net that primarily resulted from a $299million unrealized investment gain for certain non-marketable securities due to an observable price change and a $193 million unrealized investment gainassociated with certain marketable equity securities that we held for certain employee benefit plans and classified as trading, and for which an equal andoffsetting amount was recorded to our operating expenses during the same period. These increases in non-operating income, net were partially offset by lowerinterest income that we recognized in fiscal 2021, which was caused by lower average interest rates that were applicable to our cash, cash equivalent andmarketable securities balances.Benefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes: Our effective income tax rates for each of the periods presented were the result of the mix of income earned invarious tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in thisAnnual report for a discussion regarding the differences between the effective income tax rates as presented for the periods below and the U.S. federalstatutory income tax rates that were in effect during these periods. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earningsweighted to jurisdictions with higher tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, by adverse rulings in tax related litigation, or by shortfalls instock-based compensation realized by employees relative to stock-based compensation that was recorded for book purposes, among others.  Year Ended May 31,       Percent Change    (Dollars in millions) 2021  Actual Constant 2020 Benefit from (provision for) income taxes $747  * * $(1,928)Effective tax (benefit) expense rate (5.7%)      16.0%  *Not meaningful52Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements  We recognized a benefit from income taxes in fiscal 2021 in comparison to income tax expense in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the favorable impact of a $2.3billion net tax benefit arising from an increase in a net deferred tax asset associated with a partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted in theintra-group transfer of certain intellectual property rights in fiscal 2021 and, to a lesser extent, a net change in unrecognized tax benefits due to settlements withtax authorities and an increase in excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by an unfavorable jurisdictional mix ofearnings and higher pre-tax income in fiscal 2021.Liquidity and Capital Resources   As of May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2021  Change 2020 Working capital $31,403  -10% $34,940 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $46,554  8% $43,057 Working capital: The decrease in working capital as of May 31, 2021 in comparison to May 31, 2020 was primarily due to cash used for repurchases of ourcommon stock, the reclassification of $8.3 billion of long-term senior notes as current liabilities, cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders and cash used forcapital expenditures during fiscal 2021. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by our issuance of $15.0 billion of long-term senior notes in March 2021(refer to recent Financing Activities below for additional information), the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal2021 and cash proceeds from stock option exercises. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, theamounts and timing of which are variable.Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, Tier-1commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of corporate debt securities and certain othersecurities. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2021 in comparison to May 31, 2020 was primarily due to cash inflowsgenerated by our issuance of $15.0 billion of long-term senior notes in March 2021, cash inflows generated by our operations and cash inflows from stock optionexercises during fiscal 2021. These cash inflows during fiscal 2021 were partially offset by certain cash outflows, primarily $20.9 billion for settled repurchases ofour common stock, payments of cash dividends to our stockholders, the repayment of $2.6 billion related to our borrowings, and cash used for capitalexpenditures.The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash, cash equivalents andmarketable securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as ofthe end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in our consolidatedbalance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual report). As theU.S. Dollar generally weakened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2021, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securitiesthat we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries increased on a net basis as of May 31, 2021 relative to what we would have reported using constantcurrency rates from the May 31, 2020 balance sheet date.  Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2021  Change 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $15,887  21% $13,139 Net cash (used for) provided by investing activities $(13,098) * $9,843 Net cash used for financing activities $(10,378) 69% $(6,132) *Not meaningfulCash flows from operating activities:   Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal oftheir license support agreements. Payments from customers for these license support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’terms, which are generally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the53Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements sales of new licenses, cloud services, hardware offerings and other services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee relatedexpenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes, interest payments and leased facilities.Net cash provided by operating activities increased during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher net income, higher cash collections fromcustomers, a portion of which were previously delayed due to the global economic effects that resulted from COVID-19, and certain other cash favorable workingcapital changes, in each case in fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020.Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales ofour investments in marketable securities, and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth.Net cash used for investing activities was $13.1 billion during fiscal 2021 in comparison to net cash provided by investing activities of $9.8 billion during fiscal2020. Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2021 primarily resulted from an increase in cash used for the purchases of marketable securities andother investments and an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by an increase in cash proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities andother investments, in each case during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2022, we expect our capital expenditures could nearly double relative to fiscal2021, primarily to increase data center capacities and geographic locations to meet current and expected customer demand for our cloud services.Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debtinstruments, stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs.Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2021 increased compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from the issuance of senior notes andhigher stock repurchases, partially offset by lower debt repayments and higher cash proceeds from stock option exercises, in each case during fiscal 2021 incomparison to fiscal 2020.Free cash flow:   To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basisto analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with ourcompetitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of ourperformance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flow as follows:   Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2021  Change 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $15,887  21% $13,139 Capital expenditures  (2,135) 37%  (1,564)Free cash flow $13,752  19% $11,575 Net income $13,746    $10,135 Free cash flow as percent of net income 100%    114% Long-Term Customer Financing: We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire licenses, cloud services, hardware and other services offerings throughseparate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financialinstitutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution. We generally record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions assales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. We financed $941 million in fiscal 2021 and$1.0 billion in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019 of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues.54Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements Recent Financing Activities:Cash Dividends:   In fiscal 2021, we declared and paid cash dividends of $1.04 per share that totaled $3.1 billion. In June 2021, our Board of Directors declared aquarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 29, 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July15, 2021. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board ofDirectors.Senior Notes: In March 2021, we issued $15.0 billion of senior notes comprised of the following: •$2.75 billion of 1.65% senior notes due March 2026; •$2.00 billion of 2.30% senior notes due March 2028; •$3.25 billion of 2.875% senior notes due March 2031; •$2.25 billion of 3.65% senior notes due March 2041; •$3.25 billion of 3.95% senior notes due March 2051; and •$1.50 billion of 4.10% senior notes due March 2061.We issued the senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, repaymentof indebtedness and future acquisitions. Additionally, in fiscal 2021, we repaid $1.0 billion and €1.25 billion of senior notes pursuant to their terms. Additionaldetails regarding our senior notes are included in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report.Common Stock Repurchase Program:   Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On March 10, 2021, weannounced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $20.0 billion. As of May 31, 2021, approximately$15.6 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 329.2 million shares for $21.0 billion, 361.0million shares for $19.2 billion, and 733.8 million shares for $36.0 billion in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does nothave an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitionsand dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchasesmay be effected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated,suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.  Contractual Obligations:   Our largest contractual obligations as of May 31, 2021 consisted of: •principal payments related to our senior notes and other borrowings that are included in our consolidated balance sheet and the related periodicinterest payments; •routine tax payments including those that are payable pursuant to the transition tax under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that are included inour consolidated balance sheet; •operating lease liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet; and •other contractual commitments associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding.In addition, as of May 31, 2021, we had $8.5 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on ourconsolidated balance sheet, the nature of which is uncertain with respect to settlement or release with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it isreasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2022. We are involved in claims and legal proceedings, which areinherently uncertain with respect to outcomes, estimates and assumptions that we make as of each reporting period, are inherently unpredictable, and manyaspects are out of our control. Notes 7, 11, 14 and 17 of55Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report include additional information regarding our contractual obligations andcontingencies.We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital,capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements. In addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments andrepurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additionalborrowings or from the issuance of additional securities.Restricted Stock-Based Awards and Stock OptionsOur stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employeesand align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders.We recognize that restricted stock-based awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awardsgranted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2018 has been aweighted-average annualized rate of 1.0% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stock-based awardsand stock options granted and assumed, net of restricted stock-based awards and stock options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by theweighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stock-based awards vest andstock options are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options at May 31, 2021, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, all have exercise prices lowerthan the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program. However, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors, including theamount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. As of May 31, 2021, themaximum potential dilution from all outstanding restricted stock-based awards and unexercised stock options, regardless of when granted and regardless ofwhether vested or unvested, was 7.7%.During fiscal 2021, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants toselected employees; all stock-based award grants to senior officers; and any individual grant of restricted stock units of 62,500 or greater. Each member of aseparate executive officer committee, referred to as the Plan Committee, was allocated a fiscal 2021 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal yearto grant equity within his or her organization, subject to certain limitations established by the Compensation Committee.56Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements restricted stock-based award and stock option activity from June 1, 2018 through May 31, 2021 is summarized as follows (shares in millions): restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding at May 31, 2018  393 restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted  164 restricted stock-based awards vested and issued and stock options exercised  (267)Forfeitures, cancellations and other, net  (73)restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding at May 31, 2021  217 Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations  31 Weighted-average annualized stock repurchases  (475)Shares outstanding at May 31, 2021  2,814 Basic weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2018 through May 31, 2021  3,263 restricted stock-based awards and stock options outstanding as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2021 7.7% Total restricted stock-based awards and in the money stock options outstanding (based on the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day offiscal 2021) as a percent of shares outstanding at May 31, 2021 7.7% Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and before stockrepurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2018 through May 31, 2021 1.0% Weighted-average annualized restricted stock-based awards and stock options granted and assumed, net of forfeitures and cancellations and after stockrepurchases, as a percent of weighted-average shares outstanding from June 1, 2018 through May 31, 2021 -13.6%  Recent Accounting PronouncementsFor information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, ifany, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate RiskCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $46.6 billion and $43.1 billion as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our bank deposits are generallyheld with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investment-grade credit ratings or financial institutions that meet investment-grade ratingscriteria, which we believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks. In addition, as of May 31, 2021, substantially all of our marketable securities were highquality, fixed-rate debt securities and had maturity dates within one year (a description of the types of marketable securities held as of May 31, 2021 and 2020 isincluded in Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report and “Liquidity and Capital resources” above).The market values of our fixed-rate marketable securities investments are adversely impacted as interest rates increase. Due in part to these factors, we mayrealize losses if we sell securities prior to their scheduled maturities that declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classifysubstantially all of our investments in debt securities as available-for-sale and record changes in their fair values to AOCL on our consolidated balance sheets, nogains or losses are recognized in our earnings due to market changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to their scheduled maturities or thedeclines in fair values are due to expected credit loss. We generally do not use our marketable debt securities investments for trading purposes.Borrowings and Related Fair Value HedgesOur total borrowings were $84.2 billion as of May 31, 2021, consisting of $84.1 billion of fixed-rate borrowings and $113 million of other borrowings, comparedto $71.6 billion as of May 31, 2020, consisting of $71.5 billion of fixed-rate borrowings and $113 million of other borrowings. With the exception of those seniornotes for which we have57Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements corresponding fair value hedges that are recorded at their fair values as of each reporting period and discussed further below, we record all of our fixed-rateborrowings at amortized cost and therefore, any changes in interest rates do not impact the values that we report for these senior notes or our consolidatedfinancial statements.As of May 31, 2021, we held certain interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interestrate obligations associated with certain of our senior notes to variable interest rate obligations based on LIBOr that we have designated as fair value hedges,among certain other effects. Consequently, these swap agreements are recorded at their fair values at each reporting period and incur gains and losses due tochanges in market interest rates but are substantially offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related senior notes for which the swap agreementspertained. By entering into these swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOr. Changes in interest ratesaffected the interest expense that we recognized in our consolidated statements of operations and the values that we report for these instruments as of eachreporting date. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related swap agreements are included in Notes 7 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements included elsewhere in this Annual report. We do not use these swap arrangements for trading purposes.Currency RiskForeign Currency Translation RiskAs described under “Constant Currency Presentation” above, our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significantportion of our consolidated revenues and expenses that we report in U.S. Dollars. As a result, our consolidated revenues and expenses are affected and willcontinue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major foreign currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets,liabilities, earnings and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars for, and as of the end of,each reporting period. In particular, the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar generally will reduce the reported amount of our foreign-denominated cash, cashequivalents, marketable securities, total revenues and total expense that we translate into U.S. Dollars and report in our consolidated financial statements for,and as of the end of, each reporting period.Foreign Currency Transaction RiskWe transact business in various foreign currencies. Our principal currency exposures include the Euro, Japanese Yen, Saudi Arabian riyal, Indian rupee andBritish Pound. Our foreign currency exposures primarily arise from various intercompany transactions. We have established a program that primarily utilizesforeign currency forward contracts to offset the risks that arise from the aforementioned transactions. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreigncurrency forward contracts for major currencies in which we have an exposure so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset bygains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts which mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We maysuspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration and we do not use them for tradingpurposes.We realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts, and we also incurcosts to enter into these foreign currency forward contracts, substantially all of which are included in non-operating income, net in our consolidated financialstatements. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currencytransactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on ourforeign currency forward contracts and other factors. Furthermore, as a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experienceadditional foreign currency volatility in the future, in which the amounts and timing are unknown. refer to Notes 1 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements included elsewhere in this Annual report for additional details about our foreign currency forward contracts.58Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements Sensitivity AnalysisThe following table sets forth the hypothetical potential losses that we consider to be the most material to the fair values of our interest rate and currencyinfluenced holdings, including associated derivatives, or future earnings resulting from hypothetical changes in relevant market rates as of or for the reportingperiods below:      Year Ended May 31, (in millions) Hypothetical Change Impact 2021  2020 Interest rate risk:            Marketable securities 50 basis points increase in interest rates Fair values $(23) $(15)Interest rate swap and cross-currency interest rate swap agreements 100 basis points increase in interest rates Fair values $(37) $(63)Interest rate swap and cross-currency interest rate swap agreements 100 basis points increase in interest rates Earnings $(24) $(24)Foreign currency risk:            Total revenues 10% decrease in foreign exchange rates Earnings $(2,061) $(1,942)Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 10% decrease in foreign exchange rates Fair values $(650) $(491) Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary DataThe response to this item is submitted as a separate section of this Annual report.

for which an equal and offsetting amount was recorded to our operating expenses during the same period.Income TaxesWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences oftemporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes. Werecord a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.A two-step approach is applied pursuant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit,including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50%likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of ourconsolidated statements of operations.A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as a part of a business combination isprovided under “Business Combinations” above.82Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2021 Recent Accounting PronouncementsFinancial Instruments: In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform onFinancial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) and also issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance (collectively, Topic 848). Topic 848 provides optional guidancefor contract modifications and certain hedging relationships associated with the transition from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. We willadopt Topic 848 when our relevant contracts are modified upon transition to alternative reference rates. We do not expect our adoption of Topic 848 will have amaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements.Income Taxes:  In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12), which isintended to simplify various areas related to the accounting for income taxes and improve consistent application of Topic 740. ASU 2019-12 is effective for usbeginning in fiscal 2022, and earlier adoption is permitted. We do not expect our adoption of ASU 2019-12 will have a material impact on our consolidatedfinancial statements.2.ACQUISITIONSFiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 AcquisitionsDuring fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, we acquired certain companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our productsand services offerings. These acquisitions were not significant individually or in the aggregate to our consolidated financial statements. 3.CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIESCash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, money market funds and other securitieswith original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain othersecurities.The amortized principal amounts of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated their fair values at May 31, 2021 and 2020. We use thespecific identification method to determine any realized gains or losses from the sale of our marketable securities classified as available-for-sale. Such realizedgains and losses were insignificant for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019. The following table summarizes the components of our cash equivalents and marketablesecurities held, substantially all of which were classified as available-for-sale:   May 31, (in millions) 2021  2020 Money market funds $12,263  $18,587 Corporate debt securities and other  9,470   6,625 Commercial paper debt securities  11,712   5,640 Total investments $33,445  $30,852 Investments classified as cash equivalents $16,989  $25,034 Investments classified as marketable securities $16,456  $5,818  As of May 31, 2021 and 2020, substantially all of our marketable securities investments mature within one year. Our investment portfolio is subject to marketrisk due to changes in interest rates. As described above, we limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities, which have high creditratings and also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. As stated in our investment policy, we are averse to principal loss and seek to preserve ourinvested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.83Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2021 restricted cash that was included within cash and cash equivalents as presented within our consolidated balance sheets as of May 31, 2021 and 2020 and ourconsolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was nominal.4.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSWe perform fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid totransfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assetsand liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and considerassumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs whenmeasuring fair value. An asset’s or a liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fairvalue measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: •Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; •Level 2: inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets orliabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can becorroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or •Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisOur assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following (Level 1 and Level 2 inputs are defined above):   May 31, 2021  May 31, 2020   Fair Value MeasurementsUsing Input Types      Fair Value MeasurementsUsing Input Types     (in millions) Level 1  Level 2  Total  Level 1  Level 2  Total Assets:                        Money market funds $12,263  $—  $12,263  $18,587  $—  $18,587 Corporate debt securities and other  1,250   8,220   9,470   4,036   2,589   6,625 Commercial paper debt securities  —   11,712   11,712   —   5,640   5,640 Derivative financial instruments  —   73   73   —   29   29 Total assets $13,513  $20,005  $33,518  $22,623  $8,258  $30,881 Liabilities:                        Derivative financial instruments $—  $—  $—  $—  $268  $268  Our marketable securities investments consist of money market funds, Tier 1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain othersecurities. Marketable securities as presented per our consolidated balance sheets included securities with original maturities at the time of purchase greaterthan three months and the remainder of the securities were included in cash and cash equivalents.

We recorded rOU assets of $1.7 billion in exchange for operating lease obligations during the year ended May 31, 2021. Cash paid foramounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $696 million for year ended May 31, 2021. As of May 31, 2021, the weighted averageremaining lease term for operating leases was approximately seven years and the weighted average discount rate used for calculating operating lease obligationswas 2.8%. As of May 31, 2021, we have $653 million of additional operating lease commitments, primarily for data centers, that commence in fiscal 2022 forterms of one to eleven years that were not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2021 or in the maturities table below.93Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2021 Maturities of operating lease liabilities were as follows as of May 31, 2021 (in millions): Fiscal 2022 $694 Fiscal 2023  544 Fiscal 2024  427 Fiscal 2025  367 Fiscal 2026  320 Thereafter  710 Total operating lease payments  3,062 Less: imputed interest  (280)Total operating lease liability $2,782 Unconditional ObligationsIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers, which are agreements that are enforceable andlegally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximatetiming of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies, perform final assemblies and perform testing of our hardwareproducts. We also obtain individual components for our hardware products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Suchpurchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amounts disclosed below. Certain routinearrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in theordinary course of business are not included in the amounts below, as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms andare difficult to quantify in a meaningful way.As of May 31, 2021, our unconditional purchase and certain other obligations were as follows (in millions): Fiscal 2022 $1,484 Fiscal 2023  143 Fiscal 2024  89 Fiscal 2025  61 Fiscal 2026  28 Thereafter  212 Total $2,017  As described in Notes 7 and 10 above, as of May 31, 2021 we have senior notes and other borrowings that mature at various future dates and derivative financialinstruments outstanding that we leverage to manage certain risks and exposures.GuaranteesOur cloud, license and hardware sales agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our products infringe athird party’s intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any materialliabilities related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our sales agreements also include provisions indemnifying customersagainst liabilities in the event we breach confidentiality or service level requirements.

Under the Plans, for eachshare granted as a full value award in the form of a restricted stock unit (rSU) or a performance-based restricted stock award (PSU), an equivalent of 2.5 shares isdeducted from our pool of shares available for grant.As of May 31, 2021, 107 million unvested restricted stock units (rSUs), 36 million performance-based stock options (PSOs), and service-based stock options (SOs)to purchase 69 million shares of common stock, of which 66 million shares were vested, were outstanding under the Plans. Approximately 210 million shares ofcommon stock were available for future awards under the 2020 Plan as of May 31, 2021. To date, we have not issued any stock options under the 2020 Plan orany stock purchase rights or stock appreciation rights under either of the Plans.The vesting schedule for all awards granted under the Plans is established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. rSUs generally requireservice-based vesting of 25% annually over four years. SOs were previously granted under the 2000 Plan at not less than fair market value, become exercisablegenerally 25% annually over four years of service, and generally expire 10 years from the date of grant.PSOs granted under the 2000 Plan to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer in fiscal 2018 consisted of seven numerically equivalent vestingtranches that potentially may vest. One tranche vests solely on the attainment of a market-based metric. The remaining six tranches require the attainment ofboth a performance metric and a market capitalization metric. In each case, the market-based metric, performance metrics and market capitalization metrics forthe PSOs may be achieved at any time during the required performance period, assuming continued employment and service through the date theCompensation Committee of the Board of Directors certifies that performance has been achieved. The PSOs have contractual lives of eight years in comparisonto the typical ten year contractual lives for SOs. For the six tranches of the PSOs with both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensationexpense is to be recognized starting at the time each vesting tranche becomes probable of achievement over the longer of the estimated implicit service periodor derived service period. Stock-based compensation associated with a vesting tranche where vesting is no longer96Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2021 determined to be probable is reversed on a cumulative basis and is no longer prospectively recognized in the period when such a determination is made. Stock-based compensation for the market-based tranche was recognized using the derived service period for the market-based metric achievement, which weestimated to be approximately three years.In connection with certain of our acquisitions, we assumed certain outstanding restricted stock-based awards and stock options under each acquired company’srespective stock plans, or we substituted substantially similar awards under the Plans. These restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed orsubstituted generally retained all of the rights, terms and conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally granted. As of May 31, 2021, stockoptions to purchase approximately 1 million shares of common stock were outstanding under acquired company stock plans that Oracle assumed.In fiscal 1993, the Board adopted the 1993 Directors’ Stock Plan (the Directors’ Plan), which provides for the issuance of rSUs and other stock-based awards,including non-qualified stock options, to non-employee directors. The Directors’ Plan has from time to time been amended and restated. Under the terms of theDirectors’ Plan, 10 million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance (including a fiscal 2013 amendment to increase the number of shares of ourcommon stock reserved for issuance by 2 million shares). In prior years, we granted stock options at not less than fair market value, that vest over four years, andexpire no more than 10 years from the date of grant. Currently, we only grant rSUs that vest fully on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant. The Directors’Plan was most recently amended on April 29, 2016 and permits the Compensation Committee of the Board to determine the amount and form of automaticgrants of stock awards, if any, to each non-employee director upon first becoming a director and thereafter on an annual basis, as well as automatic grants forchairing certain Board committees, subject to certain stockholder approved limitations set forth in the Directors’ Plan. In April 2020, the CompensationCommittee reduced the maximum value of the annual automatic rSU grants to each non-employee director from $400,000 to $350,000 and eliminated all equitygrants for chairing board committees. As of May 31, 2021, approximately 49,000 unvested rSUs and stock options to purchase approximately 1 million shares ofcommon stock (all of which were vested) were outstanding under the Directors’ Plan. As of May 31, 2021, approximately 1 million shares were available forfuture stock awards under this plan.The following table summarizes restricted stock-based award activity granted pursuant to Oracle-based stock plans and stock plans assumed from ouracquisitions for our last three fiscal years ended May 31, 2021:   Restricted Stock-Based Awards Outstanding (in millions, except fair value) Number ofShares  Weighted-AverageGrant Date Fair Value Balance, May 31, 2018  89  $42.93 Granted  53  $42.47 Vested and Issued  (31) $41.85 Canceled  (12) $42.97 Balance, May 31, 2019  99  $43.01 Granted  50  $53.38 Vested and Issued  (34) $42.67 Canceled  (14) $46.81 Balance, May 31, 2020  101  $48.36 Granted  54  $54.95 Vested and Issued  (34) $46.88 Canceled  (11) $50.40 Balance, May 31, 2021  110  $51.87  The total grant date fair values of restricted stock-based awards that were vested and issued in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $1.6 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.3billion, respectively.

Approximately 31 million shares outstanding as of May 31, 2021 were not expected to vest.Stock-Based Compensation Expense and Valuations of Stock AwardsWe estimated the fair values of our restricted stock-based awards that are solely subject to service-based vesting requirements based upon their market valuesas of the grant dates, discounted for the present values of expected dividends.Stock-based compensation expense was included in the following operating expense line items in our consolidated statements of operations:98Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2021    Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2021  2020  2019 Cloud services and license support $134  $110  $99 Hardware  11   11   10 Services  55   54   49 Sales and marketing  313   261   360 research and development  1,188   1,035   963 General and administrative  136   119   172 Total stock-based compensation  1,837   1,590   1,653 Estimated income tax benefit included in provision for income taxes  (413)  (343)  (358)Total stock-based compensation, net of estimated income tax benefit $1,424  $1,247  $1,295  Tax Benefits from Exercises of Stock Options and Vesting of Restricted Stock-Based AwardsTotal cash received as a result of stock option exercises was approximately $1.7 billion, $1.5 billion and $2.0 billion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.The total aggregate intrinsic value of restricted stock-based awards that vested and were issued and stock options that were exercised was $3.7 billion, $2.9billion and $3.1 billion for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In connection with the vesting and issuance of restricted stock-based awards and stockoptions that were exercised, the tax benefits realized by us were $842 million, $638 million and $692 million for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.Employee Stock Purchase PlanWe have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan) that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 95% of the fairmarket value of Oracle stock as of the end of the semi-annual option period. As of May 31, 2021, 42 million shares were reserved for future issuances under thePurchase Plan. We issued 2 million shares in each of fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, under the Purchase Plan.Defined Contribution and Other Postretirement PlansWe offer various defined contribution plans for our U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution plan expense was $380 million, $376 million and$380 million for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.In the U.S., regular employees can participate in the Oracle Corporation 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan (Oracle 401(k) Plan). Participants can generallycontribute up to 40% of their eligible compensation on a per-pay-period basis as defined by the Oracle 401(k) Plan document or by the section 402(g) limit asdefined by the U.S. Internal revenue Service (IrS). We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 50% up to 6% of compensation each pay period,subject to maximum aggregate matching amounts. Our contributions to the Oracle 401(k) Plan, net of forfeitures, were $150 million, $152 million and $154million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.We also offer non-qualified deferred compensation plans to certain employees whereby they may defer a portion of their annual base and/or variablecompensation until retirement or a date specified by the employee in accordance with the plans. Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities were eachapproximately $813 million and approximately $636 million as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and were presented in other non-current assets and othernon-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.99Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2021 We sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans that are offered primarily by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans were assumed throughour acquisitions or are required by local regulatory requirements. We may deposit funds for these plans with insurance companies, third-party trustees, or intogovernment-managed accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as applicable. Our total defined benefit plan pension expenses were $105 million,$97 million and $90 million for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate net liability (funded status) ofour defined benefit plans as of May 31, 2021 were $1.4 billion and $889 million, respectively, and as of May 31, 2020 were $1.3 billion and $884 million,respectively.14.INCOME TAXESOur effective tax rates for each of the periods presented are the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of incometax rates. Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2021 varied from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to a netdeferred tax benefit that totaled $2.3 billion that we recognized as a result of a partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted in the intra-grouptransfer of certain intellectual property (IP) rights, earnings in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with taxauthorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction and the tax effect of GILTI. Our provision for incometaxes for fiscal 2020 varied from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to earnings in foreign operations, state taxes, theU.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the Foreign Derived Intangible Incomededuction and the tax effect of GILTI. Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2019 varied from the 21% U.S. statutory rate imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts andJobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) primarily due to earnings in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with taxauthorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction, GILTI, and a $389 million net reduction to ourtransition tax recorded in connection with the Tax Act pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118.The following is a geographical breakdown of income before benefit from (provision for) income taxes:   Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2021  2020  2019 Domestic $4,375  $3,890  $3,774 Foreign  8,624   8,173   8,494 Income before benefit from (provision for) income taxes $12,999  $12,063  $12,268  100Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2021  The benefit from (provision for) income taxes consisted of the following:   Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2021  2020  2019 Current provision:            Federal $(516) $(1,616) $(979)State  (233)  (19)  (300)Foreign  (929)  (1,144)  (1,097)Total current provision $(1,678) $(2,779) $(2,376)Deferred benefit:            Federal $(8,631) $983  $(483)State  77   (50)  28 Foreign  10,979   (82)  1,646 Total deferred benefit $2,425  $851  $1,191 Total benefit from (provision for) income taxes $747  $(1,928) $(1,185)Effective income tax (benefit) expense rate (5.7%)  16.0%  9.7%  The benefit from (provision for) income taxes differed from the amount computed by applying the federal statutory rate to our income before benefit from(provision for) income taxes as follows (certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation):   Year Ended May 31, (Dollars in millions) 2021  2020  2019 U.S. federal statutory tax rate 21.0%  21.0%  21.0% Tax provision at statutory rate $(2,730) $(2,533) $(2,576)Impact of the Tax Act of 2017:            One-time transition tax  —   —   529 Deferred tax effects  —   —   (140)Foreign earnings at other than United States rates  580   496   1,053 Net impact of intra-entity IP transfer  2,266   —   — State tax expense, net of federal benefit  (206)  (172)  (163)Settlements and releases from judicial decisions and statute expirations, net  582   137   132 Tax contingency interest accrual, net  (55)  (163)  (245)Domestic tax contingency, net  (282)  (58)  (183)Federal research and development credit  169   151   159 Stock-based compensation  300   166   201 Other, net  123   48   48 Total benefit from (provision for) income taxes $747  $(1,928) $(1,185) 101Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2021  The components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:   May 31, (in millions) 2021  2020 Deferred tax assets:        Accruals and allowances $452  $469 Employee compensation and benefits  755   638 Differences in timing of revenue recognition  547   524 Lease liabilities  524   253 Basis of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets  12,161   1,115 Tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards  3,934   3,871 Total deferred tax assets  18,373   6,870 Valuation allowance  (1,526)  (1,359)Total deferred tax assets, net  16,847   5,511 Deferred tax liabilities:        Unrealized gain on stock  (78)  (78)Acquired intangible assets  (266)  (561)GILTI deferred  (9,883)  (1,108)rOU assets  (488)  (241)Withholding taxes on foreign earnings  (195)  (171)Other  (165)  (141)Total deferred tax liabilities  (11,075)  (2,300)Net deferred tax assets $5,772  $3,211 recorded as:        Non-current deferred tax assets $13,636  $3,252 Non-current deferred tax liabilities  (7,864)  (41)Net deferred tax assets $5,772  $3,211  We provide for United States income taxes on the undistributed earnings and the other outside basis temporary differences of foreign subsidiaries unless theyare considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. At May 31, 2021, the amount of temporary differences related to undistributed earnings andother outside basis temporary differences of investments in foreign subsidiaries upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided was approximately $7.9billion. If the undistributed earnings and other outside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction, they would generate foreign tax credits thatwould reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. At May 31, 2021, assuming a full utilization of theforeign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately $1.4 billion.Our net deferred tax assets were $5.8 billion and $3.2 billion as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We believe that it is more likely than not that the netdeferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxableincome in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and taxcredit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable incomechange.The valuation allowance was $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. A majority of the valuation allowances as of May 31, 2021and 2020 related to tax assets established in purchase accounting and other tax credits. Any subsequent reduction of that portion of the valuation allowance andthe recognition of the associated tax benefits associated with our acquisitions will be recorded to our provision for income taxes102Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2021 subsequent to our final determination of the valuation allowance or the conclusion of the measurement period (as defined above), whichever comes first.At May 31, 2021, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $502 million, which are subject to limitation on their utilization.Approximately $447 million of these federal net operating losses expire in various years between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2038. Approximately $55 million of thesefederal net operating losses are not currently subject to expiration dates. We had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.0 billion at May 31,2021, which expire between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2040 and are subject to limitations on their utilization. We had total foreign net operating loss carryforwards ofapproximately $1.8 billion at May 31, 2021, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $1.7 billion of these foreign net operating lossesare not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the foreign net operating losses, approximately $86 million, expire between fiscal 2022 and fiscal2041. At May 31, 2021, we had federal capital loss carryforwards of approximately $501 million, which expire in fiscal 2026. We had state capital losscarryforwards of approximately $661 million, which expire between fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026. We had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1.1 billion atMay 31, 2021, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $765 million of these tax credit carryforwards are not currently subject toexpiration dates. The remainder of the tax credit carryforwards, approximately $378 million, expire in various years between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2041.We classify our unrecognized tax benefits as either current or non-current income taxes payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Theaggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits, including acquisitions, were as follows:   Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2021  2020  2019 Gross unrecognized tax benefits as of June 1 $6,972  $6,348  $5,592 Increases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years  225   624   772 Decreases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years  (836)  (298)  (135)Increases related to tax positions taken during current fiscal year  531   628   540 Settlements with tax authorities  (51)  (177)  (153)Lapses of statutes of limitation  (66)  (116)  (202)Cumulative translation adjustments and other, net  137   (37)  (66)Total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of May 31 $6,912  $6,972  $6,348  As of May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, $4.4 billion, $4.3 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits would affect our effective tax rate ifrecognized. We recognized interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements ofoperations of $166 million, $202 million and $312 million during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of May 31, 2021 and2020 were $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.Domestically, U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal2019. Many issues are at an advanced stage in the examination process, the most significant of which include transfer pricing, domestic production activity,foreign tax credits, research and development credits, state economic nexus, and qualification as a state manufacturer. With all of these domestic audit issuesconsidered in the aggregate, we believe that it was reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2021, the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to these auditscould decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $798 million ($671 million net of offsetting taxbenefits). Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2010 and, with some exceptions, we are no longer subject to auditfor those periods. Our U.S. state income tax returns, with some exceptions, have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2007, and we are no longer subject toaudit for those periods.103Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2021 business’ contractual activities are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and the related cash flows are typically highest in the following quarter (i.e., in thefirst fiscal quarter of the next fiscal year) as we receive payments from these contracts.Our hardware business provides Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware, operating systems, virtualization, management andother hardware-related software to support diverse IT environments.

This table provides areconciliation of our total operating segment revenues to our total revenues as reported in our consolidated statements of operations.Disaggregation of RevenuesWe have considered information that is regularly reviewed by our CODMs in evaluating financial performance, and disclosures presented outside of our financialstatements in our earnings releases and used in investor presentations to disaggregate revenues to depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty ofrevenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The principal category we use to disaggregate revenues is the nature of our products and services aspresented in our consolidated statements of operations, the total of which is reconciled to revenues from our reportable segments as per the preceding tables ofthis footnote.The following table is a summary of our total revenues by geographic region. The relative proportion of our total revenues between each geographic region aspresented in the table below was materially consistent across each of our operating segments’ revenues for each of fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019:  Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2021  2020  2019 Americas $21,828  $21,563  $21,856 EMEA(1)  11,894   11,035   11,270 Asia Pacific  6,757   6,470   6,380 Total revenues $40,479  $39,068  $39,506  (1)Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa  106Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsORACLE CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)May 31, 2021  The following table presents our cloud services and license support revenues by applications and infrastructure ecosystems.  Year Ended May 31, (in millions) 2021  2020  2019 Applications cloud services and license support $11,712  $11,015  $10,553 Infrastructure cloud services and license support  16,988   16,377   16,154 Total cloud services and license support revenues $28,700  $27,392  $26,707  Geographic InformationDisclosed in the table below is geographic information for each country that comprised greater than three percent of our total revenues for any of fiscal 2021,2020 or 2019.   As of and for the Year Ended May 31,   2021  2020  2019 (in millions) Revenues  Long-LivedAssets(1)  Revenues  Long-LivedAssets(1)  Revenues  Long-LivedAssets(1) United States $18,734  $6,826  $18,428  $6,012  $18,596  $5,318 United Kingdom  2,110   685   1,904   472   2,054   423 Japan  1,988   650   1,977   655   1,848   422 Germany  1,744   561   1,510   418   1,583   263 Canada  1,281   199   1,162   169   1,166   87 Other countries  14,622   2,464   14,087   1,977   14,259   1,356 Total $40,479  $11,385  $39,068  $9,703  $39,506  $7,869  (1)Long-lived assets exclude goodwill, intangible assets, equity investments and deferred taxes, which are not allocated to specific geographic locations as it is impracticable to do so.16.EARNINGS PER SHAREBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted‑average number of common shares outstanding during the period,plus the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock-based awards, stock options, and shares issuable under the employee stock purchase plan as applicablepursuant to the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:   Year Ended May 31, (in millions, except per share data) 2021  2020  2019 Net income $13,746  $10,135  $11,083 Weighted average common shares outstanding  2,945   3,211   3,634 Dilutive effect of employee stock plans  77   83   98 Dilutive weighted average common shares outstanding  3,022   3,294   3,732 Basic earnings per share $4.67  $3.16  $3.05 Diluted earnings per share $4.55  $3.08  $2.97 Shares subject to anti-dilutive restricted stock-based awards and stock options excluded from calculation(1)  36   56   71  (1)These weighted shares relate to anti-dilutive restricted stock-based awards and stock options, both of which were service-based, as calculated using the treasury stock method and contingently issuableshares, substantially all of which were related to PSO agreements. Such shares could be dilutive in the future.
