development of our products. We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and
technology. While we believe that our patents have value, no single patent is essential to us or to any of our principal businesses. rapid technological advances in
cloud, software and hardware development, evolving standards in computer hardware and software technology, changing customer needs and frequent new
product introductions, offerings and enhancements characterize the markets in which we compete. We plan to continue to dedicate a significant amount of
resources to research and development efforts to maintain and improve our current products and services offerings.
Human Capital Resources
At Oracle, our success is driven by the quality of our people, who we believe are among the best and brightest in the industry. We strive to create an
environment that supports employee success and a culture where everyone has a voice in driving innovation.
Workforce
As of May 31, 2021, we employed approximately 132,000 full-time employees, of which approximately 45,000 were employed in the U.S. and approximately
87,000 were employed internationally. Our employee counts by lines of business are:
35,000 Sales and marketing 23,000 Services
19,000 Cloud services and license support operations 40,000 research and development
3,000 Hardware 12,000 General and administrative
None of our employees in the U.S. is represented by a labor union; however, in certain foreign subsidiaries, labor unions or workers’ councils represent some of
our employees.
Diversity and Inclusion
We believe that innovation starts with inclusion. We endeavor to hire employees from a broad pool of talent with diverse backgrounds, perspectives and abilities
and we believe Oracle’s diverse leaders serve as role models for our inclusive workforce. We seek to continuously build on our inclusive hiring strategies, tracking
our progress and holding ourselves accountable for greater diversity at Oracle. Our programs are supported by Oracle leaders across the company with strategic
sponsorship from Oracle’s Executive Diversity Council, which is led by Safra Catz, our Chief Executive Officer, and extend through the actions we are taking
globally on Oracle’s five Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Imperatives:
• driving insight and accountability with data;
• recruiting with an intention on diversity;
• embedding inclusion into talent development;
• inspiring an inclusive culture through community; and
• investing in the future diversity of our industry.
In addition to global, regional and local programs, Oracle Human resources partners with business leaders to create and implement D&I plans to embed targeted
strategies into organizations across Oracle. Employee satisfaction on the importance of D&I at Oracle and their manager’s encouragement of diverse ideas and
perspectives ranks high in our employee engagement surveys.
Leaders Who Listen
We believe that an important aspect of creating a culture and environment that supports employee and business success is listening to employee feedback. We
share the results of our annual employee engagement survey with leaders who receive direct observations from employees about areas critical to Oracle’s
strategic priorities, including the employee and customer experience. Nearly 80% of our employees participate in the annual survey.

Stock Repurchase Program
Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On March 10, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors
approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $20.0 billion. As of May 31, 2021, approximately $15.6 billion remained available for
stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program.
Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital
needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic
and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock
repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.
The following table summarizes the stock repurchase activity for the three months ended May 31, 2021 and the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet

Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total revenues increased in fiscal 2021. The constant currency increase in our cloud and license
business’ revenues during fiscal 2021 was offset by decreases in our hardware business’ revenues and services business’ revenues. The constant currency
increase in our cloud and license business’ revenues during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 was attributable to growth in our cloud services and license support
revenues and growth in our cloud license and on-premise license revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud
and license deployment models and renewed their related cloud contracts and license support contracts to continue to gain access to the latest versions of our
technologies and to receive support services. The constant currency decrease in our hardware business’ revenues during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 was
due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our growing cloud-based infrastructure technologies and the de-emphasis of our sales and
marketing efforts for certain of our non-strategic hardware products and related support services. The constant currency decrease in our services business’
revenues during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to a decline in our consulting revenues. All three of our businesses’ revenues were
adversely impacted during fiscal 2021 and 2020 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and some of these effects may continue into fiscal 2022. While we
expect these effects to be temporary, the impacts of COVID-19 for future periods are unknown. In constant currency, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific
regions contributed 54%, 39% and 7%, respectively, to the growth in our total revenues during fiscal 2021.

Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total operating expenses decreased during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower
sales and marketing expenses, lower hardware expenses and lower services expenses, all of which were primarily attributable to lower headcount and a
reduction in certain variable expenditures as further described below. In addition, we also incurred lower amortization of intangible assets during fiscal 2021.
These constant currency expense decreases were partially offset by certain constant currency expense increases during fiscal 2021, primarily: higher cloud
services and license support expenses, which increased primarily due to higher infrastructure investments that were made to support the increase in our cloud
and license business’ revenues; higher research and development and general and administrative expenses, each of which increased primarily due to higher
employee related expenses; higher acquisition related and other expenses, which increased primarily due to certain right-of-use assets and other assets that
were abandoned in connection with plans to improve our cost structure and operations; and higher restructuring expenses, which increased due to actions taken
during fiscal 2021 pursuant to the Fiscal 2019 Oracle restructuring Plan (2019 restructuring Plan). During fiscal 2021 and 2020, we curtailed a number of variable
expenditures across all of our lines of businesses and functions including employee travel expenses and marketing expenses, among others, primarily in response
to COVID-19. We expect certain of these expenses may normalize in future periods provided global economic and health conditions improve.
In constant currency, our total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues increased in fiscal 2021 due to higher total
revenues and lower total operating expenses. In fiscal 2022, we expect to accelerate our investments primarily in our cloud and license business. We expect fiscal
2022 total expenses growth to exceed total revenues growth and, as a result, our fiscal 2022 total operating margin as a percentage of total revenues to be
modestly lower relative to fiscal 2021.
Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges
To supplement our consolidated financial information, we believe that the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial

(1) In connection with our acquisitions, we have estimated the fair values of the cloud services and license support contracts assumed. Due to our application of business combination accounting rules, we
did not recognize the cloud services and license support revenue amounts as presented in the above table that would have otherwise been recorded by the acquired businesses as independent entities
upon delivery of the contractual obligations. To the extent customers for which these contractual obligations pertain renew these contracts with us, we expect to recognize revenues for the full
contracts’ values over the respective contracts’ renewal periods.
(2) represents the amortization of intangible assets, substantially all of which were acquired in connection with our acquisitions. As of May 31, 2021, estimated future amortization related to intangible
assets was as follows (in millions):
Fiscal 2022 $ 1,122

Fiscal 2024 453
Fiscal 2025 123
Fiscal 2026 24

adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net.
(4) restructuring expenses during fiscal 2021 and 2020 primarily related to employee severance in connection with our 2019 restructuring Plan. Additional information regarding certain of our restructuring
plans is provided in management’s discussion below under “restructuring Expenses” and in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report.
(5) Stock-based compensation was included in the following operating expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations (in millions):

(6) For fiscal 2021, the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to our income before provision for income taxes after excluding the tax effects of items within the table above such as for stock-based
compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, and certain other acquisition related items, and after excluding a $2.3 billion tax benefit arising from the increase of a deferred tax asset
associated with a partial realignment of our legal entity structure and any related deferred tax expense (refer to Notes 1 and 14 in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this
Annual report for additional information), resulted in an effective tax rate of 15.9%, instead of (5.7%), which represented our effective tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations.
For fiscal 2020, the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to our income before provision for income taxes after adjusting for the effects of items within the table above, such as for stock-based
compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, and certain other acquisition related items, resulted in an effective tax rate of 18.4%, instead of 16.0%, which represented our effective
tax rate as derived per our consolidated statement of operations.
Cloud and License Business
Our cloud and license business engages in the sale and marketing of our applications and infrastructure technologies that are delivered through various
deployment models and include: Oracle license support offerings; Oracle cloud services offerings; and Oracle cloud license and on-premise license offerings.
License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of license support contracts related to cloud licenses and on-premise licenses; are purchased
by our customers at their option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. Our cloud services
deliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspecified updates
and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage and support. revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized over the contractual term, which is generally
one to three years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees
earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within
cloud and on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to
download and use. We continue

future periods are unknown. In constant currency, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 57%, 38% and 5%, respectively, of the constant
currency revenue growth for this business in fiscal 2021.
In constant currency, our total cloud and license business’ expenses decreased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to lower sales and marketing expenses,
which decreased primarily due to lower employee related expenses and our curtailment of variable expenditures, including lower employee travel expenses and

marketing expenses, primarily in response to COVID-19. These constant currency expense decreases were partially offset by higher cloud services and license
support expenses during fiscal 2021, which were primarily attributable to higher technology infrastructure expenses to support the increase in our cloud and
license business’ revenues. Our cloud services and license support expenses have grown in recent periods and, in fiscal 2022, we expect this growth to accelerate
as we increase our existing data center capacity and establish data centers in new geographic locations in order to meet current and expected customer demand.
Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues increased in
fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to the fiscal 2021 increases in total revenues and the decreases in total expenses for this business.
Hardware Business
Our hardware business’ revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, server, storage, and industry-specific hardware offerings. The
hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a
combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware
product is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware
support contracts purchased by our customers at their option and that are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are
delivered over the contractual term, which is generally one year. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent
distributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our
hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal
manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of
inventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support
services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our
hardware offerings.

emphasis of our sales and marketing efforts for certain of our non-strategic hardware products and related support services, the net impact of which resulted in
reduced sales volumes of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of hardware support contracts sold in recent periods. Our
hardware business’ revenues were also adversely impacted during fiscal 2021 and 2020 by the unfavorable economic effects caused by COVID-19.
Geographically, we experienced constant currency revenue declines in all regions during fiscal 2021, other than Asia Pacific.
Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, total hardware expenses decreased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower hardware

Services Business
We offer services to customers and partners to help maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.
Services revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed. The cost of providing our services consists primarily of personnel related

of consulting project delays due to customer resource constraints and in-person meeting restrictions imposed by certain jurisdictions. In addition, we incurred
lower billable travel expenses and lower billable sub-contractor expenses for which we would have been reimbursed by our customers, which reduced the

Excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, total general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily
due to certain higher employee related expenses including higher variable compensation expenses and higher stock-based compensation expenses. These
increases were partially offset by lower salary expenses due to lower headcount, and by lower travel expenses and certain other variable expense curtailments
that we implemented during fiscal 2021 primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19. In addition, general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2021 were
unfavorably affected in comparison to the prior year due to a $29 million litigation related benefit that reduced our expenses during fiscal 2020.
Amortization of Intangible Assets: Substantially all of our intangible assets were acquired through our business combinations. We amortize our intangible
assets over, and monitor the appropriateness of, the estimated useful lives of these assets. We also periodically review these intangible assets for potential
impairment based upon relevant facts and circumstances. Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report has

Amortization of intangible assets decreased in fiscal 2021 due to a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully
amortized, partially offset by a smaller amount of additional amortization from intangible assets that we acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions.

On a constant currency basis, acquisition related and other expenses increased during fiscal 2021 due to higher other expenses, net which primarily related to
certain facilities-related right-of-use assets and certain other assets that were abandoned in connection with plans to improve our cost structure and operations
during fiscal 2021.
Restructuring Expenses: restructuring expenses resulted from the execution of management approved restructuring plans that were generally developed to
improve our cost structure and/or operations, often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies and/or other strategic initiatives. restructuring
expenses consist of employee severance costs and other contract termination costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. For additional information

committed to and initiated the 2019 restructuring Plan in order to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations. We may incur additional
restructuring expenses in future periods due to the initiation of new restructuring plans or from changes in estimated costs associated with existing restructuring
plans.
The majority of the initiatives undertaken by our 2019 restructuring Plan were effected to implement our continued emphasis in developing, marketing and
selling our cloud-based offerings. These initiatives impacted certain of our sales and marketing and research and development operations. Certain of the cost
savings realized pursuant to our 2019 restructuring Plan initiatives were offset by investments in resources and geographies that better address the
development, marketing, sale and delivery of our cloud based offerings including investments in our second generation cloud infrastructure.

Interest expense increased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 substantially due to higher average borrowings resulting from our issuance of $15.0 billion of
senior notes in March 2021 and $20.0 billion of senior notes in March 2020.
Non-Operating Income, net: Non-operating income, net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange losses, the noncontrolling interests
in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (primarily Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Corporation Japan) and net other income
and expenses, including net realized gains and losses related to all of our investments, net unrealized gains and losses related to the small portion of our

Our non-operating income, net increased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher other income, net that primarily resulted from a $299
million unrealized investment gain for certain non-marketable securities due to an observable price change and a $193 million unrealized investment gain
associated with certain marketable equity securities that we held for certain employee benefit plans and classified as trading, and for which an equal and
offsetting amount was recorded to our operating expenses during the same period. These increases in non-operating income, net were partially offset by lower
interest income that we recognized in fiscal 2021, which was caused by lower average interest rates that were applicable to our cash, cash equivalent and
marketable securities balances.
Benefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes: Our effective income tax rates for each of the periods presented were the result of the mix of income earned in

We recognized a benefit from income taxes in fiscal 2021 in comparison to income tax expense in fiscal 2020 primarily due to the favorable impact of a $2.3
billion net tax benefit arising from an increase in a net deferred tax asset associated with a partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted in the
intra-group transfer of certain intellectual property rights in fiscal 2021 and, to a lesser extent, a net change in unrecognized tax benefits due to settlements with
tax authorities and an increase in excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by an unfavorable jurisdictional mix of
earnings and higher pre-tax income in fiscal 2021.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of May 31,
(Dollars in millions) 2021 Change 2020
Working capital $ 31,403 -10% $ 34,940
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 46,554 8% $ 43,057
Working capital: The decrease in working capital as of May 31, 2021 in comparison to May 31, 2020 was primarily due to cash used for repurchases of our
common stock, the reclassification of $8.3 billion of long-term senior notes as current liabilities, cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders and cash used for
capital expenditures during fiscal 2021. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by our issuance of $15.0 billion of long-term senior notes in March 2021
(refer to recent Financing Activities below for additional information), the favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from our net income during fiscal
2021 and cash proceeds from stock option exercises. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the
amounts and timing of which are variable.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities: Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, money market funds, Tier-1
commercial paper and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of corporate debt securities and certain other
securities. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at May 31, 2021 in comparison to May 31, 2020 was primarily due to cash inflows
generated by our issuance of $15.0 billion of long-term senior notes in March 2021, cash inflows generated by our operations and cash inflows from stock option
exercises during fiscal 2021. These cash inflows during fiscal 2021 were partially offset by certain cash outflows, primarily $20.9 billion for settled repurchases of
our common stock, payments of cash dividends to our stockholders, the repayment of $2.6 billion related to our borrowings, and cash used for capital
expenditures.
The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities balances held by our foreign subsidiaries is subject to translation adjustments caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of
the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in our consolidated
balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income included elsewhere in this Annual report). As the
U.S. Dollar generally weakened against certain major international currencies during fiscal 2021, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
that we reported in U.S. Dollars for these subsidiaries increased on a net basis as of May 31, 2021 relative to what we would have reported using constant
currency rates from the May 31, 2020 balance sheet date.

Cash flows from operating activities: Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of
their license support agreements. Payments from customers for these license support agreements are generally received near the beginning of the contracts’
terms, which are generally one year in length. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also have historically generated cash from the

sales of new licenses, cloud services, hardware offerings and other services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee related
expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes, interest payments and leased facilities.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased during fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to higher net income, higher cash collections from
customers, a portion of which were previously delayed due to the global economic effects that resulted from COVID-19, and certain other cash favorable working
capital changes, in each case in fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020.
Cash flows from investing activities: The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to the timing of our purchases, maturities and sales of
our investments in marketable securities, and investments in capital and other assets, including certain intangible assets, to support our growth.
Net cash used for investing activities was $13.1 billion during fiscal 2021 in comparison to net cash provided by investing activities of $9.8 billion during fiscal
2020. Net cash used for investing activities during fiscal 2021 primarily resulted from an increase in cash used for the purchases of marketable securities and
other investments and an increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by an increase in cash proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and
other investments, in each case during fiscal 2021 relative to fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2022, we expect our capital expenditures could nearly double relative to fiscal
2021, primarily to increase data center capacities and geographic locations to meet current and expected customer demand for our cloud services.
Cash flows from financing activities: The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt
instruments, stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs.
Net cash used for financing activities during fiscal 2021 increased compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from the issuance of senior notes and
higher stock repurchases, partially offset by lower debt repayments and higher cash proceeds from stock option exercises, in each case during fiscal 2021 in
comparison to fiscal 2020.
Free cash flow: To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis
to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with our
competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our
performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flow as follows:
Year Ended May 31,
(Dollars in millions) 2021 Change 2020

Free cash flow $ 13,752 19% $ 11,575
Net income $ 13,746 $ 10,135
Free cash flow as percent of net income 100% 114%
Long-Term Customer Financing: We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire licenses, cloud services, hardware and other services offerings through
separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial
institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution. We generally record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as
sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. We financed $941 million in fiscal 2021 and
$1.0 billion in each of fiscal 2020 and 2019 of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues.

Recent Financing Activities:
Cash Dividends: In fiscal 2021, we declared and paid cash dividends of $1.04 per share that totaled $3.1 billion. In June 2021, our Board of Directors declared a
quarterly cash dividend of $0.32 per share of our outstanding common stock payable on July 29, 2021 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July
15, 2021. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of
Directors.
Senior Notes: In March 2021, we issued $15.0 billion of senior notes comprised of the following:
• $2.75 billion of 1.65% senior notes due March 2026;
• $2.00 billion of 2.30% senior notes due March 2028;
• $3.25 billion of 2.875% senior notes due March 2031;
• $2.25 billion of 3.65% senior notes due March 2041;
• $3.25 billion of 3.95% senior notes due March 2051; and
• $1.50 billion of 4.10% senior notes due March 2061.
We issued the senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock, repayment
of indebtedness and future acquisitions. Additionally, in fiscal 2021, we repaid $1.0 billion and €1.25 billion of senior notes pursuant to their terms. Additional
details regarding our senior notes are included in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report.
Common Stock Repurchase Program: Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. On March 10, 2021, we
announced that our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $20.0 billion. As of May 31, 2021, approximately
$15.6 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased 329.2 million shares for $21.0 billion, 361.0
million shares for $19.2 billion, and 733.8 million shares for $36.0 billion in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our stock repurchase authorization does not
have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions
and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases
may be effected from time to time through open market purchases and pursuant to a rule 10b5-1 plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated,
suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.
Contractual Obligations: Our largest contractual obligations as of May 31, 2021 consisted of:
• principal payments related to our senior notes and other borrowings that are included in our consolidated balance sheet and the related periodic
interest payments;
• routine tax payments including those that are payable pursuant to the transition tax under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that are included in
our consolidated balance sheet;
• operating lease liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet; and
• other contractual commitments associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding.
In addition, as of May 31, 2021, we had $8.5 billion of gross unrecognized income tax benefits, including related interest and penalties, recorded on our
consolidated balance sheet, the nature of which is uncertain with respect to settlement or release with the relevant tax authorities, although we believe it is
reasonably possible that certain of these liabilities could be settled or released during fiscal 2022. We are involved in claims and legal proceedings, which are
inherently uncertain with respect to outcomes, estimates and assumptions that we make as of each reporting period, are inherently unpredictable, and many
aspects are out of our control. Notes 7, 11, 14 and 17 of

Index to Financial Statements
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report include additional information regarding our contractual obligations and
contingencies.
We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital,
capital expenditures and contractual obligation requirements. In addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and
repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional
borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities.
Restricted Stock-Based Awards and Stock Options
Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees
and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders.
We recognize that restricted stock-based awards and stock options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awards
granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2018 has been a
weighted-average annualized rate of 1.0% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new restricted stock-based awards
and stock options granted and assumed, net of restricted stock-based awards and stock options forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the
weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all restricted stock-based awards vest and
stock options are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options at May 31, 2021, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, all have exercise prices lower
than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock-
based compensation program. However, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors, including the
amount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. As of May 31, 2021, the
maximum potential dilution from all outstanding restricted stock-based awards and unexercised stock options, regardless of when granted and regardless of
whether vested or unvested, was 7.7%.
During fiscal 2021, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviewed and approved the annual organization-wide stock-based award grants to
selected employees; all stock-based award grants to senior officers; and any individual grant of restricted stock units of 62,500 or greater. Each member of a
separate executive officer committee, referred to as the Plan Committee, was allocated a fiscal 2021 equity budget that could be used throughout the fiscal year
to grant equity within his or her organization, subject to certain limitations established by the Compensation Committee.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
For information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, if
any, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report.
Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $46.6 billion and $43.1 billion as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our bank deposits are generally
held with large, diverse financial institutions worldwide with high investment-grade credit ratings or financial institutions that meet investment-grade ratings
criteria, which we believe mitigates credit risk and certain other risks. In addition, as of May 31, 2021, substantially all of our marketable securities were high
quality, fixed-rate debt securities and had maturity dates within one year (a description of the types of marketable securities held as of May 31, 2021 and 2020 is
included in Notes 3 and 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report and “Liquidity and Capital resources” above).
The market values of our fixed-rate marketable securities investments are adversely impacted as interest rates increase. Due in part to these factors, we may
realize losses if we sell securities prior to their scheduled maturities that declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because we classify
substantially all of our investments in debt securities as available-for-sale and record changes in their fair values to AOCL on our consolidated balance sheets, no
gains or losses are recognized in our earnings due to market changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to their scheduled maturities or the
declines in fair values are due to expected credit loss. We generally do not use our marketable debt securities investments for trading purposes.
Borrowings and Related Fair Value Hedges
Our total borrowings were $84.2 billion as of May 31, 2021, consisting of $84.1 billion of fixed-rate borrowings and $113 million of other borrowings, compared
to $71.6 billion as of May 31, 2020, consisting of $71.5 billion of fixed-rate borrowings and $113 million of other borrowings. With the exception of those senior
notes for which we have

corresponding fair value hedges that are recorded at their fair values as of each reporting period and discussed further below, we record all of our fixed-rate
borrowings at amortized cost and therefore, any changes in interest rates do not impact the values that we report for these senior notes or our consolidated
financial statements.
As of May 31, 2021, we held certain interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed-interest
rate obligations associated with certain of our senior notes to variable interest rate obligations based on LIBOr that we have designated as fair value hedges,
among certain other effects. Consequently, these swap agreements are recorded at their fair values at each reporting period and incur gains and losses due to
changes in market interest rates but are substantially offset by the corresponding losses and gains on the related senior notes for which the swap agreements
pertained. By entering into these swap arrangements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOr. Changes in interest rates
affected the interest expense that we recognized in our consolidated statements of operations and the values that we report for these instruments as of each
reporting date. Additional details regarding our senior notes and related swap agreements are included in Notes 7 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report. We do not use these swap arrangements for trading purposes.
Currency Risk
Foreign Currency Translation Risk
As described under “Constant Currency Presentation” above, our international operations have provided and are expected to continue to provide a significant
portion of our consolidated revenues and expenses that we report in U.S. Dollars. As a result, our consolidated revenues and expenses are affected and will
continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major foreign currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets,
liabilities, earnings and cash flows that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars for, and as of the end of,
each reporting period. In particular, the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar generally will reduce the reported amount of our foreign-denominated cash, cash
equivalents, marketable securities, total revenues and total expense that we translate into U.S. Dollars and report in our consolidated financial statements for,
and as of the end of, each reporting period.
Foreign Currency Transaction Risk
We transact business in various foreign currencies. Our principal currency exposures include the Euro, Japanese Yen, Saudi Arabian riyal, Indian rupee and
British Pound. Our foreign currency exposures primarily arise from various intercompany transactions. We have established a program that primarily utilizes
foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks that arise from the aforementioned transactions. Under this program, our strategy is to enter into foreign
currency forward contracts for major currencies in which we have an exposure so that increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by
gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts which mitigate the risks and volatility associated with our foreign currency transactions. We may
suspend this program from time to time. Our foreign currency forward contracts are generally short-term in duration and we do not use them for trading
purposes.
We realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures, net of gains or losses from our foreign currency forward contracts, and we also incur
costs to enter into these foreign currency forward contracts, substantially all of which are included in non-operating income, net in our consolidated financial
statements. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency
transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, the net realized gain or loss on our
foreign currency forward contracts and other factors. Furthermore, as a large portion of our consolidated operations are international, we could experience
additional foreign currency volatility in the future, in which the amounts and timing are unknown. refer to Notes 1 and 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included elsewhere in this Annual report for additional details about our foreign currency forward contracts.

Item 8.Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
The response to this item is submitted as a separate section of this Annual report. See Part IV, Item 15.
Item 9.Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A.Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this Annual report on Form 10-K, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our
Disclosure Committee and our management, including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e).
Based on our management’s evaluation (with the participation of our Principal Executive and Financial Officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report,
our Principal Executive and Financial Officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of May 31, 2021 to provide reasonable
assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal
Executive and Financial Officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer, we
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2021 based on the guidelines established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s 2013 framework. Our internal control over
financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2021. We
reviewed the results of management’s assessment with our Finance and Audit Committee.

classified as trading, and for which an equal and offsetting amount was recorded to our operating expenses during the same period.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences of
temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes. We
record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.
A two-step approach is applied pursuant to ASC 740 in the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit,
including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50%
likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our
consolidated statements of operations.
A description of our accounting policies associated with tax related contingencies and valuation allowances assumed as a part of a business combination is
provided under “Business Combinations” above.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Financial Instruments: In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on
Financial Reporting (ASU 2020-04) and also issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance (collectively, Topic 848). Topic 848 provides optional guidance
for contract modifications and certain hedging relationships associated with the transition from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. We will
adopt Topic 848 when our relevant contracts are modified upon transition to alternative reference rates. We do not expect our adoption of Topic 848 will have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes: In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (ASU 2019-12), which is
intended to simplify various areas related to the accounting for income taxes and improve consistent application of Topic 740. ASU 2019-12 is effective for us
beginning in fiscal 2022, and earlier adoption is permitted. We do not expect our adoption of ASU 2019-12 will have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.
2. ACQUISITIONS
Fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 Acquisitions
During fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, we acquired certain companies and purchased certain technology and development assets primarily to expand our products
and services offerings. These acquisitions were not significant individually or in the aggregate to our consolidated financial statements.
3. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES
Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, money market funds and other securities
with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of Tier-1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain other
securities.
The amortized principal amounts of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities approximated their fair values at May 31, 2021 and 2020. We use the
specific identification method to determine any realized gains or losses from the sale of our marketable securities classified as available-for-sale. Such realized
gains and losses were insignificant for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019. The following table summarizes the components of our cash equivalents and marketable
securities held, substantially all of which were classified as available-for-sale:
May 31,
(in millions) 2021 2020
Money market funds $ 12,263 $ 18,587
Corporate debt securities and other 9,470 6,625
Commercial paper debt securities 11,712 5,640
Total investments $ 33,445 $ 30,852
Investments classified as cash equivalents $ 16,989 $ 25,034
Investments classified as marketable securities $ 16,456 $ 5,818
As of May 31, 2021 and 2020, substantially all of our marketable securities investments mature within one year. Our investment portfolio is subject to market
risk due to changes in interest rates. As described above, we limit purchases of marketable debt securities to investment-grade securities, which have high credit
ratings and also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. As stated in our investment policy, we are averse to principal loss and seek to preserve our
invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk.

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
We perform fair value measurements in accordance with ASC 820. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets
and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider
assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.
ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when
measuring fair value. An asset’s or a liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
• Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• Level 2: inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or
liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be
corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or
• Level 3: unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following (Level 1 and Level 2 inputs are defined above):

Our marketable securities investments consist of money market funds, Tier 1 commercial paper debt securities, corporate debt securities and certain other
securities. Marketable securities as presented per our consolidated balance sheets included securities with original maturities at the time of purchase greater
than three months and the remainder of the securities were included in cash and cash equivalents. Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of
our instruments that were classified as Level 1 in the table above were derived from quoted market prices and active markets for these instruments that exist.
Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of Level 2 instruments listed in the table above were derived from the following: non-

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)
May 31, 2021
(1) In July 2013, we issued €2.0 billion of fixed-rate senior notes comprised of €1.25 billion of 2.25% senior notes that were due and were settled in January 2021 (January 2021 Notes) and €750 million of
3.125% senior notes due July 2025 (July 2025 Notes, and together with the January 2021 Notes, the Euro Notes). Principal and unamortized discount/issuance costs for the Euro Notes in the table above
were calculated using foreign currency exchange rates, as applicable, as of May 31, 2021 and May 31, 2020, respectively. The July 2025 Notes are registered and trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
(2) In connection with the issuance of the January 2021 Notes, we entered into certain cross-currency swap agreements, all of which were cash settled upon their maturity during fiscal 2021 (see Note 10
for additional information).
(3) We entered into certain interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effects of modifying the fixed-interest obligations associated with the 2.80% senior notes due July 2021 (July 2021 Notes)
so that the interest payable on these notes effectively became variable based on LIBOr. The effective interest rates after consideration of these fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements were
0.87% and 1.99%, respectively, for the July 2021 Notes as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. refer to Notes 1 and 10 for a description of our accounting for fair value hedges associated with our
July 2021 Notes.
(4) In fiscal 2018 we entered into certain cross-currency interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of converting our fixed-rate, Euro-denominated debt, including annual interest
payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to a variable-rate, U.S. Dollar-denominated debt of $871 million based on LIBOr. The effective interest rates as of May 31, 2021 and 2020 after
consideration of the cross-currency interest rate swap agreements were 3.15% and 4.46%, respectively, for the July 2025 Notes. refer to Notes 1 and 10 for a description of our accounting for fair value
hedges.
(5) In March 2021, we issued $15.0 billion of senior notes for general corporate purposes, which may include stock repurchases, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and repayment of
indebtedness and future acquisitions. The interest is payable semi-annually. We may redeem some or all of the senior notes of each series prior to their maturity, subject to certain restrictions, and the
payment of an applicable make-whole premium in certain instances.
Future principal payments (adjusted for the effects of the cross-currency interest rate swap agreements associated with the July 2025 Notes) for all of our
borrowings at May 31, 2021 were as follows (in millions):
Fiscal 2022 $ 8,250
Fiscal 2023 3,750
Fiscal 2024 3,500
Fiscal 2025 10,000
Fiscal 2026 3,734
Thereafter 55,250
Total $ 84,484
Senior Notes
Interest is payable semi-annually for the senior notes listed in the above table except for the Euro Notes for which interest is payable annually. We may redeem
some or all of the senior notes of each series prior to their maturity, subject to certain restrictions, and the payment of an applicable make-whole premium in
certain instances.
The senior notes rank pari passu with any other notes we may issue in the future pursuant to our commercial paper program (see additional discussion regarding
our commercial paper program below) and all existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness of Oracle Corporation. All existing and future liabilities of the
subsidiaries of Oracle Corporation are or will be effectively senior to the senior notes and any future issuances of commercial paper notes. We were in
compliance with all debt-related covenants at May 31, 2021.

We do not designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to ASC 815. Accordingly, we recorded the fair values of these contracts as of the
end of each reporting period to our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair values recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. The balance
sheet classification for the fair values of these forward contracts is other current assets for forward contracts in an unrealized gain position and other current
liabilities for forward contracts in an unrealized loss position. The statement of operations classification for changes in fair values of these forward contracts is
non-operating income, net for both realized and unrealized gains and losses.
As of May 31, 2021 and 2020, the notional amounts of the forward contracts we held to purchase U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major international
currencies were $4.3 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, and the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. Dollars in exchange for other major
international currencies were $4.5 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. The fair values of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts were nominal at
May 31, 2021 and 2020. The cash flows related to these foreign currency contracts are classified as operating activities.

Leases
We have operating leases that primarily relate to certain of our facilities, data centers and vehicles. As of May 31, 2021, our operating leases substantially have
remaining terms of one year to eleven years, some of which include options to extend and/or terminate the leases.
Operating lease expenses totaled $654 million, net of sublease income of $13 million in fiscal 2021 and $599 million, net of sublease income of $16 million in
fiscal 2020. At May 31, 2021, rOU assets, current lease liabilities and non-current lease liabilities for our operating leases were $2.6 billion, $664 million and $2.1
billion, respectively. We recorded rOU assets of $1.7 billion in exchange for operating lease obligations during the year ended May 31, 2021. Cash paid for
amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $696 million for year ended May 31, 2021. As of May 31, 2021, the weighted average
remaining lease term for operating leases was approximately seven years and the weighted average discount rate used for calculating operating lease obligations
was 2.8%. As of May 31, 2021, we have $653 million of additional operating lease commitments, primarily for data centers, that commence in fiscal 2022 for
terms of one to eleven years that were not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as of May 31, 2021 or in the maturities table below.

Unconditional Obligations
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into certain unconditional purchase obligations with our suppliers, which are agreements that are enforceable and
legally binding and specify terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate
timing of the payment. We utilize several external manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies, perform final assemblies and perform testing of our hardware
products. We also obtain individual components for our hardware products from a variety of individual suppliers based on projected demand information. Such
purchase commitments are based on our forecasted component and manufacturing requirements and typically provide for fulfillment within agreed upon lead-
times and/or commercially standard lead-times for the particular part or product and have been included in the amounts disclosed below. Certain routine
arrangements for other materials and goods that are not related to our external manufacturers and certain other suppliers and that are entered into in the
ordinary course of business are not included in the amounts below, as they are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms and
are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way.
As of May 31, 2021, our unconditional purchase and certain other obligations were as follows (in millions):
Fiscal 2022 $ 1,484

As described in Notes 7 and 10 above, as of May 31, 2021 we have senior notes and other borrowings that mature at various future dates and derivative financial
instruments outstanding that we leverage to manage certain risks and exposures.
Guarantees
Our cloud, license and hardware sales agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our products infringe a
third party’s intellectual property rights. To date, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any material
liabilities related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our sales agreements also include provisions indemnifying customers
against liabilities in the event we breach confidentiality or service level requirements. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these
indemnification agreements due to our

Total accumulated other comprehensive loss $ (1,175) $ (1,716)
13. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Stock-Based Compensation Plans
Stock Plans
In fiscal 2021, we adopted the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2020 Plan) to replace the Amended and restated 2000 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the 2000
Plan and, together with the 2020 Plan, the Plans) which provides for the issuance of long-term performance awards, including restricted stock-based awards,
non-qualified stock options and incentive stock options, as well as stock purchase rights and stock appreciation rights, to our eligible employees, officers and
directors who are also employees or consultants, independent consultants and advisers.
The total number of shares authorized under the 2020 Plan is (i) 90 million shares, plus (ii) the number of shares that remained unissued and were available for
grant under the 2000 Plan as of the date of adoption of the 2020 Plan, plus (iii) the number of shares granted and outstanding as of the date of adoption of the
2020 Plan which would have been available again for issuance under the terms of the 2000 Plan had the 2020 Plan not been adopted. Under the Plans, for each
share granted as a full value award in the form of a restricted stock unit (rSU) or a performance-based restricted stock award (PSU), an equivalent of 2.5 shares is
deducted from our pool of shares available for grant.
As of May 31, 2021, 107 million unvested restricted stock units (rSUs), 36 million performance-based stock options (PSOs), and service-based stock options (SOs)
to purchase 69 million shares of common stock, of which 66 million shares were vested, were outstanding under the Plans. Approximately 210 million shares of
common stock were available for future awards under the 2020 Plan as of May 31, 2021. To date, we have not issued any stock options under the 2020 Plan or
any stock purchase rights or stock appreciation rights under either of the Plans.
The vesting schedule for all awards granted under the Plans is established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. rSUs generally require
service-based vesting of 25% annually over four years. SOs were previously granted under the 2000 Plan at not less than fair market value, become exercisable
generally 25% annually over four years of service, and generally expire 10 years from the date of grant.
PSOs granted under the 2000 Plan to our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer in fiscal 2018 consisted of seven numerically equivalent vesting
tranches that potentially may vest. One tranche vests solely on the attainment of a market-based metric. The remaining six tranches require the attainment of
both a performance metric and a market capitalization metric. In each case, the market-based metric, performance metrics and market capitalization metrics for
the PSOs may be achieved at any time during the required performance period, assuming continued employment and service through the date the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors certifies that performance has been achieved. The PSOs have contractual lives of eight years in comparison
to the typical ten year contractual lives for SOs. For the six tranches of the PSOs with both performance and market conditions, stock-based compensation
expense is to be recognized starting at the time each vesting tranche becomes probable of achievement over the longer of the estimated implicit service period
or derived service period. Stock-based compensation associated with a vesting tranche where vesting is no longer

determined to be probable is reversed on a cumulative basis and is no longer prospectively recognized in the period when such a determination is made. Stock-
based compensation for the market-based tranche was recognized using the derived service period for the market-based metric achievement, which we
estimated to be approximately three years.
In connection with certain of our acquisitions, we assumed certain outstanding restricted stock-based awards and stock options under each acquired company’s
respective stock plans, or we substituted substantially similar awards under the Plans. These restricted stock-based awards and stock options assumed or
substituted generally retained all of the rights, terms and conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally granted. As of May 31, 2021, stock
options to purchase approximately 1 million shares of common stock were outstanding under acquired company stock plans that Oracle assumed.
In fiscal 1993, the Board adopted the 1993 Directors’ Stock Plan (the Directors’ Plan), which provides for the issuance of rSUs and other stock-based awards,
including non-qualified stock options, to non-employee directors. The Directors’ Plan has from time to time been amended and restated. Under the terms of the
Directors’ Plan, 10 million shares of common stock are reserved for issuance (including a fiscal 2013 amendment to increase the number of shares of our
common stock reserved for issuance by 2 million shares). In prior years, we granted stock options at not less than fair market value, that vest over four years, and
expire no more than 10 years from the date of grant. Currently, we only grant rSUs that vest fully on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant. The Directors’
Plan was most recently amended on April 29, 2016 and permits the Compensation Committee of the Board to determine the amount and form of automatic
grants of stock awards, if any, to each non-employee director upon first becoming a director and thereafter on an annual basis, as well as automatic grants for
chairing certain Board committees, subject to certain stockholder approved limitations set forth in the Directors’ Plan. In April 2020, the Compensation
Committee reduced the maximum value of the annual automatic rSU grants to each non-employee director from $400,000 to $350,000 and eliminated all equity
grants for chairing board committees. As of May 31, 2021, approximately 49,000 unvested rSUs and stock options to purchase approximately 1 million shares of
common stock (all of which were vested) were outstanding under the Directors’ Plan. As of May 31, 2021, approximately 1 million shares were available for
future stock awards under this plan.
The following table summarizes restricted stock-based award activity granted pursuant to Oracle-based stock plans and stock plans assumed from our
acquisitions for our last three fiscal years ended May 31, 2021:

Total 76 $ 35.76 2.91 $ 3,266
(1) The aggregate intrinsic value was calculated based on the gross difference between our closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal 2021 of $78.74 and the exercise prices for all “in-the-money”
options outstanding, excluding tax effects.
(2) The unrecognized compensation expense calculated under the fair value method for shares expected to vest (unvested shares net of expected forfeitures) as of May 31, 2021 was approximately $17
million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.44 years. Approximately 31 million shares outstanding as of May 31, 2021 were not expected to vest.
Stock-Based Compensation Expense and Valuations of Stock Awards
We estimated the fair values of our restricted stock-based awards that are solely subject to service-based vesting requirements based upon their market values
as of the grant dates, discounted for the present values of expected dividends.
Stock-based compensation expense was included in the following operating expense line items in our consolidated statements of operations:

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Purchase Plan) that allows employees to purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is 95% of the fair
market value of Oracle stock as of the end of the semi-annual option period. As of May 31, 2021, 42 million shares were reserved for future issuances under the
Purchase Plan. We issued 2 million shares in each of fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, under the Purchase Plan.
Defined Contribution and Other Postretirement Plans
We offer various defined contribution plans for our U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution plan expense was $380 million, $376 million and
$380 million for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
In the U.S., regular employees can participate in the Oracle Corporation 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan (Oracle 401(k) Plan). Participants can generally
contribute up to 40% of their eligible compensation on a per-pay-period basis as defined by the Oracle 401(k) Plan document or by the section 402(g) limit as
defined by the U.S. Internal revenue Service (IrS). We match a portion of employee contributions, currently 50% up to 6% of compensation each pay period,
subject to maximum aggregate matching amounts. Our contributions to the Oracle 401(k) Plan, net of forfeitures, were $150 million, $152 million and $154
million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
We also offer non-qualified deferred compensation plans to certain employees whereby they may defer a portion of their annual base and/or variable
compensation until retirement or a date specified by the employee in accordance with the plans. Deferred compensation plan assets and liabilities were each
approximately $813 million and approximately $636 million as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and were presented in other non-current assets and other
non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

We sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans that are offered primarily by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans were assumed through
our acquisitions or are required by local regulatory requirements. We may deposit funds for these plans with insurance companies, third-party trustees, or into
government-managed accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as applicable. Our total defined benefit plan pension expenses were $105 million,
$97 million and $90 million for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate net liability (funded status) of
our defined benefit plans as of May 31, 2021 were $1.4 billion and $889 million, respectively, and as of May 31, 2020 were $1.3 billion and $884 million,
respectively.
14. INCOME TAXES
Our effective tax rates for each of the periods presented are the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income
tax rates. Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2021 varied from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to a net
deferred tax benefit that totaled $2.3 billion that we recognized as a result of a partial realignment of our legal entity structure that resulted in the intra-group
transfer of certain intellectual property (IP) rights, earnings in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax
authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction and the tax effect of GILTI. Our provision for income
taxes for fiscal 2020 varied from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate primarily due to earnings in foreign operations, state taxes, the
U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the Foreign Derived Intangible Income
deduction and the tax effect of GILTI. Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2019 varied from the 21% U.S. statutory rate imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) primarily due to earnings in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax
authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction, GILTI, and a $389 million net reduction to our
transition tax recorded in connection with the Tax Act pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118.
The following is a geographical breakdown of income before benefit from (provision for) income taxes:

We provide for United States income taxes on the undistributed earnings and the other outside basis temporary differences of foreign subsidiaries unless they
are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. At May 31, 2021, the amount of temporary differences related to undistributed earnings and
other outside basis temporary differences of investments in foreign subsidiaries upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided was approximately $7.9
billion. If the undistributed earnings and other outside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction, they would generate foreign tax credits that
would reduce the federal tax liability associated with the foreign dividend or the otherwise taxable transaction. At May 31, 2021, assuming a full utilization of the
foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these other outside basis temporary differences would be approximately $1.4 billion.
Our net deferred tax assets were $5.8 billion and $3.2 billion as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We believe that it is more likely than not that the net
deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable
income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax
credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income
change.
The valuation allowance was $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. A majority of the valuation allowances as of May 31, 2021
and 2020 related to tax assets established in purchase accounting and other tax credits. Any subsequent reduction of that portion of the valuation allowance and
the recognition of the associated tax benefits associated with our acquisitions will be recorded to our provision for income taxes

subsequent to our final determination of the valuation allowance or the conclusion of the measurement period (as defined above), whichever comes first.
At May 31, 2021, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $502 million, which are subject to limitation on their utilization.
Approximately $447 million of these federal net operating losses expire in various years between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2038. Approximately $55 million of these
federal net operating losses are not currently subject to expiration dates. We had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.0 billion at May 31,
2021, which expire between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2040 and are subject to limitations on their utilization. We had total foreign net operating loss carryforwards of
approximately $1.8 billion at May 31, 2021, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $1.7 billion of these foreign net operating losses
are not currently subject to expiration dates. The remainder of the foreign net operating losses, approximately $86 million, expire between fiscal 2022 and fiscal
2041. At May 31, 2021, we had federal capital loss carryforwards of approximately $501 million, which expire in fiscal 2026. We had state capital loss
carryforwards of approximately $661 million, which expire between fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026. We had tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1.1 billion at
May 31, 2021, which are subject to limitations on their utilization. Approximately $765 million of these tax credit carryforwards are not currently subject to
expiration dates. The remainder of the tax credit carryforwards, approximately $378 million, expire in various years between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2041.
We classify our unrecognized tax benefits as either current or non-current income taxes payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The
aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits, including acquisitions, were as follows:
Year Ended May 31,
(in millions) 2021 2020 2019
Gross unrecognized tax benefits as of June 1 $ 6,972 $ 6,348 $ 5,592
Increases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years 225 624 772
Decreases related to tax positions from prior fiscal years (836) (298) (135)
Increases related to tax positions taken during current fiscal year 531 628 540
Settlements with tax authorities (51) (177) (153)
Lapses of statutes of limitation (66) (116) (202)
Cumulative translation adjustments and other, net 137 (37) (66)
Total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of May 31 $ 6,912 $ 6,972 $ 6,348
As of May 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, $4.4 billion, $4.3 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits would affect our effective tax rate if
recognized. We recognized interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements of
operations of $166 million, $202 million and $312 million during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Interest and penalties accrued as of May 31, 2021 and
2020 were $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.
Domestically, U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal
2019. Many issues are at an advanced stage in the examination process, the most significant of which include transfer pricing, domestic production activity,
foreign tax credits, research and development credits, state economic nexus, and qualification as a state manufacturer. With all of these domestic audit issues
considered in the aggregate, we believe that it was reasonably possible that, as of May 31, 2021, the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to these audits
could decrease (whether by payment, release, or a combination of both) in the next 12 months by as much as $798 million ($671 million net of offsetting tax
benefits). Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2010 and, with some exceptions, we are no longer subject to audit
for those periods. Our U.S. state income tax returns, with some exceptions, have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2007, and we are no longer subject to
audit for those periods.

Disaggregation of Revenues
We have considered information that is regularly reviewed by our CODMs in evaluating financial performance, and disclosures presented outside of our financial
statements in our earnings releases and used in investor presentations to disaggregate revenues to depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of
revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The principal category we use to disaggregate revenues is the nature of our products and services as
presented in our consolidated statements of operations, the total of which is reconciled to revenues from our reportable segments as per the preceding tables of
this footnote.
The following table is a summary of our total revenues by geographic region. The relative proportion of our total revenues between each geographic region as
presented in the table below was materially consistent across each of our operating segments’ revenues for each of fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019:

16. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted‑average number of common shares outstanding during the period,
plus the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock-based awards, stock options, and shares issuable under the employee stock purchase plan as applicable
pursuant to the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:
