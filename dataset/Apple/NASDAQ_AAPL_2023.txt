The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China,Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East andAfrica. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in theCompany’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one ismanaged separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographicregion.Markets and DistributionThe Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells itsproducts and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. TheCompany also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023,the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales.CompetitionThe markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downwardpressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement inproduct price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers andbusinesses. Many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating theCompany’s products and infringing on its intellectual property.®®®SM®®®®®Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services andtechnologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features(including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software andaccessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services.The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as wellas established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines,lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices andlowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. TheCompany’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content andapplications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, orcollaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.Supply of ComponentsAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained fromsingle or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at timessubject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilizecustom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until thesuppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’srequirements.The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend orrenew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.Research and DevelopmentBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s ability to compete successfullydepends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Companycontinues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development(“R&D”), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.Intellectual PropertyThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software andservices. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Althoughthe Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend inpart on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.The Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design andmarketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued andregistered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products andservices. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by thirdparties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company’s products, processes and services. While theCompany has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could beobtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3Business Seasonality and Product IntroductionsThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holidaydemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of productintroductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a productlaunch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumersand distributors anticipate a product introduction.Human CapitalThe Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its teammembers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees.Workplace Practices and PoliciesThe Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.Compensation and BenefitsThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company’s success. TheCompany recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in theirprofessional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools andresources that are designed to support employees’ individual growth and development.Inclusion and DiversityThe Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Companycontinues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for allemployees.EngagementThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative workenvironment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback orconcerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.Health and SafetyThe Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to developmeasures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specificprograms in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its teammembers, visitors and customers through its global security team.Available InformationThe Company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant toSections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are filed with the U.S. Securities and ExchangeCommission (the “SEC”).

Risk FactorsThe Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently knownor unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results ofoperations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected.Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance shouldnot be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements.This section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and theconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.Macroeconomic and Industry RisksThe Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions canmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. In addition, the Company’sglobal supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside theU.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions.Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currencyfluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company’s products and services. Inaddition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility,declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors.In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditionscan have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channelpartners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.Adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterpartiesand other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company’s financialinstruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.The Company’s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public healthissues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.Political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other businessinterruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers,suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 5The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, and the Company believes that itgenerally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partnerslocated primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls onimports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability tooffer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regionswhere the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Companyto take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changingthe Company’s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to theCompany’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverseimpacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictionsbeing imposed on the Company’s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantlymore severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other internationaldisputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’s business.Many of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locationsthat are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, powershortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks,labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climatechange is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intenseeffects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies inthe Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company’s service offerings, and negatively impact consumerspending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significantexpenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of manycritical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company’s suppliers arerequired to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption tothe Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, haveadversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumerproducts; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movementof products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to thesupply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services.While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise.Global markets for the Company’s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may beunable to compete effectively in these markets.The Company’s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downwardpressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement inproduct price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers andbusinesses.The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services andtechnologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system,numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance theseinvestments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents,trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures,and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in everycountry in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or ifcompetitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected.The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition inthese markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digitalcontent supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base ofactive devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors havethe resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes havefrom time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products orcollaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitatethe Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.The Company’s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have establishedservice offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competeswith illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.The Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company’s ability to continually improve its products andservices to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and servicesthat compete effectively.Business RisksTo remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of productsand services.Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce newproducts, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products andservices, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductionsdepends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated withnew technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company’s products, the effective management of purchasecommitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meetanticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company willsuccessfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services.The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which arelocated outside of the U.S.Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan,South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, oftenin single locations. Changes or additions to the Company’s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties.The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reducethe Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on thequality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Althougharrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to theconsumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time.While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and canmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcingpartners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company’s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have anegative impact on the Company’s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to finaldestinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes,armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes.The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments tocertain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, ifthese outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced orterminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted.Future operating results depend upon the Company’s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms.Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Manycomponents, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricingfluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductorindustry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities ofcomponents and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered intoagreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, orat all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particularindustry, further limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global orregional economic conditions on the Company’s suppliers, described in “The Company’s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regionaleconomic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition,”above, can also affect the Company’s ability to obtain components. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and priceincreases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company’s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initialcapacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of thesecomponents at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of commoncomponents instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements. When the Company’s supply of components for a new or existing producthas been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s business,results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company’sbusiness, results of operations and financial condition. The Company’s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affecteddepending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source.The Company’s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affectthe Company’s business and result in harm to the Company’s reputation.The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operatingsystem software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation ofhardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defectscould make the Company’s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as theCompany’s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company’s service offerings can have quality issues and fromtime to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company’s services have not performed as anticipated and maynot meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software andservices it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’s products and services. In addition, theCompany can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment orintangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect theexperience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor marketacceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 8The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellationrisk.The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceedsnet realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviewslong-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicatethe assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which thecarrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets andpurchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other chargesgiven the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes.The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchaseobligations cover the Company’s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company’s marketsare volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess orinsufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments.The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms orat all.The Company’s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. Inaddition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patentcoverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company’s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual propertyrights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties.Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commerciallyreasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain theright to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certainproducts or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company’s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers.The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications andservices. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’sproducts. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company’s products, customers may choose not to buythe Company’s products.The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers’ perception andanalysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’s products compared to competitors’platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms.This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expectedfuture growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services.The Company’s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgradesoftware for the Company’s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with largermarket share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company’s devices can suffer.The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’s productsand operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace ofchange, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result indissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company’s products.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 9The Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenuethey generate on the App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within anapplication. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legaland regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting theApp Store, such as the European Union (“EU”) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024. The Company is also subjectto litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result infurther changes. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the AppStore, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Thiscould reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Companyretains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial conditioncould be materially adversely affected.Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company’s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonableterms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-partycontent, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company’s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content canbe for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Somethird-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult orimpossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company’saccess to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable priceswith acceptable usage rules.The Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content andsubscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company’s customers.Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, theCompany may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or licensesuch solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner.The Company’s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilledemployees, including key personnel, and the Company’s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture.Much of the Company’s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel,including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demandand competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company’s key personnel are located. In addition to intensecompetition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materiallyadversely affect the Company’s culture, reputation and operational flexibility.The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it couldmaterially adversely affect the Company’s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materiallyadversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers.The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distributeproducts and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly toconsumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force.Some carriers providing cellular network service for the Company’s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users’ purchases of thedevice. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 10The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers’ stores with Companyemployees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return orincremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company’s products, or uncertaintyregarding demand for some or all of the Company’s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company’s products.The Company’s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions.The Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failuresor network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses,physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuitymeasures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company’s or its vendors’ business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for alleventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company’s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company’s onlineservices, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company’s products. These events could materially adverselyaffect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significantreputational, financial, legal and operational consequences.The Company’s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company’s customers andemployees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measuresintended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidentialinformation occur and could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company’s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that arealso exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidentialinformation that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company’s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses orunauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect theCompany’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek tocompromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair theCompany’s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company’s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships,and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacksare expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumventcontrols, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company’s ability to identify, investigate and recover fromincidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict.Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across variousindustries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns,manages, stores and processes.The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss ofsensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies,these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, systemerror, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company’s or its vendors’ employees orcustomers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company’s or itsvendors’ systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactorauthentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, canresult in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company’s products and services.While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficientto cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company’s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplatedand materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks anduncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal andregulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible andintangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatoryapprovals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwiselimit the Company’s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. Thefailure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.The Company’s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.The Company’s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company’s business, results ofoperations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include theCompany’s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costsassociated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost.Legal and Regulatory Compliance RisksThe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings orgovernment investigations.The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yetbeen fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisionswhich can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings andgovernment investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generallyincreased over time and may continue to increase.The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in thefuture, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patentsand seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company isvigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actionsfrequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming anddisruptive to the Company’s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigationand resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. Theseagreements can also significantly increase the Company’s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices andlimit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services.Except as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “Legal Proceedings” and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, “Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations” under the heading “Contingencies,” in the opinion ofmanagement, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual,concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnifiedthird party in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s results of operations and financial condition for that reportingperiod could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages,disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in thefuture require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materiallyadversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types ofclaims that may arise.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increasedcosts and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.The Company’s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and datalocalization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownershipand infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, filmand digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreignexchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti–money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety,including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change.Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company’s business byincreasing the Company’s costs, limiting the Company’s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of theCompany’s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company’s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company’s supply chainand its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied.These risks and costs may increase as the Company’s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financialservices. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be noassurance the Company’s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company’s policies and procedures. If theCompany is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations andfinancial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company’s business may be announced with little or no advancenotice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changingregulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfyregulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As aresult, the Company’s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business,reputation, results of operations and financial condition.Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potentialliabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company’s business.Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governanceconsiderations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. Inaddition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, pressstatements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals andinitiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company’s control.The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholdersmay disagree with the Company’s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to itspublic statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and variedstakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company’sbusiness, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposesthe Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legaland regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting theApp Store, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in other jurisdictions. Changeshave included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could alsoaffect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to whatextent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 13The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claimsagainst the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations andfinancial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If suchinvestigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to itsApp Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is alsosubject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company’s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes.Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations andlitigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company’s commercial relationships with those business partnersand materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensingarrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company’s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currentlysubject to government investigations and legal proceedings.There can be no assurance the Company’s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of suchinvestigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company’s business practices to comply with new laws and regulationsor in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company’s products for privacy and security and otherwise adverselyaffect the experience for users of the Company’s products and services, and result in harm to the Company’s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poormarket acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales.The Company’s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection.The Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of varioustypes of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among theCompany and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additionalrestrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging andchanging requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its businesspractices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability.The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, pressstatements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state orinternational privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. Inaddition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability.In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specificobligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financialdata are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regardingthe Company’s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial datais handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company’s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject tolitigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised,the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industrydata security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process paymentcards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results ofoperations and financial condition.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 14Financial RisksThe Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate.The Company’s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on theCompany’s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company’s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressuredue to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take inresponse to such pressures; increased competition; the Company’s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressedproduct life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and deliveringcontent for the Company’s services; the Company’s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, orin the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings;fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products orservices with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and financialcondition.The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holidaydemand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Companygenerates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. TheCompany could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company’s products or services, issues with newproduct or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company’s logistics, components supply,or manufacturing partners.The Company’s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies.The Company’s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non–U.S. dollar–denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expensesworldwide. Gross margins on the Company’s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in thepast been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales andearnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company’s products. In some circumstances, forcompetitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar’s strengthening, which would adversely affectthe U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency–denominated sales.Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company’s foreign currency–denominated sales andearnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit.Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company’s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adverselyaffecting gross margins.The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreignexchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorablemovements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place.The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio.The Company’s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, politicalrisk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketablesecurities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketablesecurities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operationsand financial condition.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supplyagreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen.The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Companyalso sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of theCompany’s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significantportion of the Company’s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company’s exposure to credit andcollectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also hasunsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies orassemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply ofinventory components. As of September 30, 2023, the Company’s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements wereconcentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on itstrade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk andavoid losses.The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities.The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company’s subsidiariesare organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may besubject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizinginternational tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company’s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix ofearnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changesin tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations.The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities andgovernmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of itsprovision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company’s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimatedetermination of the Company’s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company’s business, results of operations andfinancial condition could be materially adversely affected.General RisksThe price of the Company’s stock is subject to volatility.The Company’s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technologyindustry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices inways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchasesits stock in a given period to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of futuregrowth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow,and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company’s Board of Directors, andthe Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related tofuture growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company’s stock may decline significantly, which couldhave a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 1C.    CybersecurityNot applicable.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 16Item 2.    PropertiesThe Company’s headquarters is located in Cupertino, California. As of September 30, 2023, the Company owned or leased facilities and land for corporatefunctions, R&D, data centers, retail and other purposes at locations throughout the U.S. and in various places outside the U.S. The Company believes itsexisting facilities and equipment, which are used by all reportable segments, are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of its business.Item 3.    Legal ProceedingsEpic GamesEpic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “District Court”) against the Company allegingviolations of federal and state antitrust laws and California’s unfair competition law based upon the Company’s operation of its App Store. On September 10,2021, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic’s claim. The District Court found that certainprovisions of the Company’s App Store Review Guidelines violate California’s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company fromprohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. Theinjunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the “CircuitCourt”) affirmed the District Court’s ruling. On June 7, 2023, the Company and Epic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision.On June 30, 2023, the Circuit Court denied both petitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple’s motion to stay enforcement of the injunctionpending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

%13.3 %Statutory federal income tax rate21 %21 %21 %The Company’s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreignearnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes.The Company’s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S.foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesThe Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023,along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital returnprogram over the next 12 months and beyond.The Company’s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations:DebtAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectivelythe “Notes”), with $9.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12months.The Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months.LeasesThe Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As ofSeptember 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months.Manufacturing Purchase ObligationsThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company’s products and to perform final assembly and testing offinished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, theCompany had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months.

The program does not obligate the Company toacquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company’s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends toincrease its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Company’sdiscussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates thataffect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of thisForm 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Managementbases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which formthe basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.Uncertain Tax PositionsThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company’s uncertain tax positions involvessignificant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to theallocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company’s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be giventhat the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company’s reserves. Reserves are adjusted consideringchanging facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’sexpectations could have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.Legal and Other ContingenciesThe Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain.The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requiressignificant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on the Company’sfinancial condition and operating results.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 25Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks;however, they may still impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.Interest Rate RiskThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases ininterest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company’s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company’s term debt. To protectagainst interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate–sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investmentand term debt portfolios.The following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company’s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, thatwould result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (dollars in millions):Interest RateSensitive InstrumentHypothetical InterestRate IncreasePotential Impact20232022Investment portfolio100 basis points, all tenorsDecline in fair value$3,089 $4,022 Term debt100 basis points, all tenorsIncrease in annual interest expense$194 $201 Foreign Exchange Rate RiskThe Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes inexchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S.dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company’s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange raterisk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company maychoose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost.The Company applied a value-at-risk (“VAR”) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates.The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company’s foreigncurrency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximumone-day loss in fair value of $669 million and $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively.

The preparation of these consolidated financialstatements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the use of management estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidatedfinancial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarterevery five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscalyear 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters,months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.RevenueThe Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities.Share-Based CompensationThe Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest.Cash EquivalentsAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are treated as cash equivalents.Marketable SecuritiesThe cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method.InventoriesInventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.Property, Plant and EquipmentDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis.Derivative InstrumentsThe Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.Income TaxesThe Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the Act.LeasesThe Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate, data center and retail facilities.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 33Note 2 – RevenueThe Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers.Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products orservices are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’sServices net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period followingtransfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on theCompany’s expectations and historical experience.For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to alldistinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determineSSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performanceobligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considersmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, pricescharged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost toprovide the performance obligation.The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain otherproducts. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software deliveredat the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and Maps.The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundledwith each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because theCompany lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenueallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the productis shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-linebasis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, theCompany does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value ofthe undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenuebased on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products,including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of theproduct. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer.Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application–related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.®®Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 34Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (in millions):202320222021iPhone $200,583 $205,489 $191,973 Mac 29,357 40,177 35,190 iPad 28,300 29,292 31,862 Wearables, Home and Accessories 39,845 41,241 38,367 Services 85,200 78,129 68,425 Total net sales$383,285 $394,328 $365,817 (1)Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respectiveproduct.(2)Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.Total net sales include $8.2 billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, $7.5 billion of revenuerecognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021, and $6.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2021 that was included indeferred revenue as of September 26, 2020.The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 13, “SegmentInformation and Geographic Data” for 2023, 2022 and 2021, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of netsales.As of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had total deferred revenue of $12.1 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively. As of September 30,2023, the Company expects 67% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 25% within one-to-two years, 7% within two-to-three years and 1%in greater than three years.Note 3 – Earnings Per ShareThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):202320222021Numerator:Net income$96,995 $99,803 $94,680 Denominator:Weighted-average basic shares outstanding15,744,231 16,215,963 16,701,272 Effect of dilutive share-based awards68,316 109,856 163,647 Weighted-average diluted shares15,812,547 16,325,819 16,864,919 Basic earnings per share$6.16 $6.15 $5.67 Diluted earnings per share$6.13 $6.11 $5.61 Approximately 24 million restricted stock units (“RSUs”) were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2023 because their effect wouldhave been antidilutive.(1)(1)(1)(1)(2)Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 35Note 4 – Financial InstrumentsCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable SecuritiesThe following tables show the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by significant investment category as of September 30, 2023 andSeptember 24, 2022 (in millions):2023AdjustedCostUnrealizedGainsUnrealizedLossesFairValueCash andCashEquivalentsCurrentMarketableSecuritiesNon-CurrentMarketableSecuritiesCash$28,359 $— $— $28,359 $28,359 $— $— Level 1:Money market funds481 — — 481 481 — — Mutual funds and equity securities442 12 (26)428 — 428 — Subtotal923 12 (26)909 481 428 — Level 2 :U.S. Treasury securities19,406 — (1,292)18,114 35 5,468 12,611 U.S. agency securities5,736 — (600)5,136 36 271 4,829 Non-U.S. government securities17,533 6 (1,048)16,491 — 11,332 5,159 Certificates of deposit and time deposits1,354 — — 1,354 1,034 320 — Commercial paper608 — — 608 — 608 — Corporate debt securities76,840 6 (5,956)70,890 20 12,627 58,243 Municipal securities628 — (26)602 — 192 410 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities22,365 6 (2,735)19,636 — 344 19,292 Subtotal144,470 18 (11,657)132,831 1,125 31,162 100,544 Total $173,752 $30 $(11,683)$162,099 $29,965 $31,590 $100,544 2022AdjustedCostUnrealizedGainsUnrealizedLossesFairValueCash andCashEquivalentsCurrentMarketableSecuritiesNon-CurrentMarketableSecuritiesCash$18,546 $— $— $18,546 $18,546 $— $— Level 1:Money market funds2,929 — — 2,929 2,929 — — Mutual funds274 — (47)227 — 227 — Subtotal3,203 — (47)3,156 2,929 227 — Level 2 :U.S. Treasury securities25,134 — (1,725)23,409 338 5,091 17,980 U.S. agency securities5,823 — (655)5,168 — 240 4,928 Non-U.S. government securities16,948 2 (1,201)15,749 — 8,806 6,943 Certificates of deposit and time deposits2,067 — — 2,067 1,805 262 — Commercial paper718 — — 718 28 690 — Corporate debt securities87,148 9 (7,707)79,450 — 9,023 70,427 Municipal securities921 — (35)886 — 266 620 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities22,553 — (2,593)19,960 — 53 19,907 Subtotal161,312 11 (13,916)147,407 2,171 24,431 120,805 Total $183,061 $11 $(13,963)$169,109 $23,646 $24,658 $120,805 (1)The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company’s Level 2 financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high creditratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.(2)As of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, total marketable securities included $13.8 billion and $12.7 billion, respectively, that were restricted fromgeneral use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 7, “Income Taxes”) and other agreements.(1)(2)(1)(2)Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 36The following table shows the fair value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual maturity, as of September 30, 2023 (in millions):Due after 1 year through 5 years$74,427 Due after 5 years through 10 years9,964 Due after 10 years16,153 Total fair value$100,544 The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies marketable debtsecurities as either current or non-current based solely on each instrument’s underlying contractual maturity date.Derivative Instruments and HedgingThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company maychoose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particularexposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange orinterest rates.The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items beinghedged, which are generally classified as operating activities.Foreign Exchange Rate RiskTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate theseinstruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventorypurchases, typically for up to 12 months.To protect the Company’s foreign currency–denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may useforwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 30,2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt–related foreign currencytransactions is 19 years.The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreignexchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilitiesdenominated in non-functional currencies.Interest Rate RiskTo protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or otherinstruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges.The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):20232022Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges:Foreign exchange contracts$74,730 $102,670 Interest rate contracts$19,375 $20,125 Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges:Foreign exchange contracts$104,777 $185,381 Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 37The gross fair values of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):2022Fair Value ofDerivatives Designatedas Accounting HedgesFair Value ofDerivatives Not Designatedas Accounting HedgesTotalFair ValueDerivative assets :Foreign exchange contracts$4,317 $2,819 $7,136 Derivative liabilities :Foreign exchange contracts$2,205 $2,547 $4,752 Interest rate contracts$1,367 $— $1,367 (1)Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the ConsolidatedBalance Sheet.(2)Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the ConsolidatedBalance Sheet.The derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generallyuses collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate fromcontractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally uses master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties tothe Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As ofSeptember 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, wouldbe a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $412 million.The carrying amounts of the Company’s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions):20232022Hedged assets/(liabilities):Current and non-current marketable securities$14,433 $13,378 Current and non-current term debt$(18,247)$(18,739)Accounts ReceivableTrade ReceivablesAs of September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10%. The Company’sthird-party cellular network carriers accounted for 41% and 44% of total trade receivables as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. TheCompany requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk.Vendor Non-Trade ReceivablesThe Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacturesubassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflectthe sale of these components in products net sales.

The State Aid Decision orderedIreland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as ofJanuary 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). OnJuly 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court’s decision tothe European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024. The Companybelieves it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State AidDecision.On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to othercountries. As of September 30, 2023, the adjusted recovery amount was €12.7 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is fundedinto escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings.

Theoutcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred amaterial loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and ProductAlthough most components essential to the Company’s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained fromsingle or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers,tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at timessubject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilizecustom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until thesuppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all,may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’srequirements.Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, SouthKorea, Taiwan and Vietnam.Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 46Note 13 – Segment Information and Geographic DataThe Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis.

A company’s internal control overfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparationof financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being madeonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timelydetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaNovember 2, 2023Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 51Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial DisclosureNone.Item 9A.    Controls and ProceduresEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s principal executive officer and principalfinancial officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Actwere effective as of September 30, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files orsubmits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and(ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allowtimely decisions regarding required disclosure.Inherent Limitations over Internal ControlsThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes thosepolicies and procedures that: (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’sassets;(ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance withGAAP, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s managementand directors; and(iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assetsthat could have a material effect on the financial statements.Management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s internal controls will prevent ordetect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that theobjectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits ofcontrols must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provideabsolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in futureperiods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliancewith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)under the Exchange Act).
