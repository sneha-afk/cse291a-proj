PART I
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
As our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders' letter, "Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become
one." That unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history — inspiring us to do things like tackling deep computer science
problems, such as our investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing.
Alphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. Our
Other Bets include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business. We take a long term view and manage the
portfolio of Other Bets with the discipline and rigor needed to deliver long-term returns. Each of our businesses are designed to prosper through
strong leaders and independence.
Access and technology for everyone
The Internet is one of the world’s most powerful equalizers, capable of propelling new ideas and people forward. Today, our mission to
organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then,
we’ve evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that helps you get things done. We’re focused on building an even
more helpful Google for everyone. We aspire to give everyone the tools they need to increase their knowledge, health, happiness, and success.
Across Google, we're focused on continually innovating in areas where technology can have an impact on people’s lives. Our work in AI is
helping to produce earlier and more precise flood warnings. We’re also working hard to make sure that our products are accessible to the more than
one billion individuals around the world with a disability. For example, Android 10 has automatic Live Captions for videos, podcasts and voicemails to
make it easier to consume information on the phone.
Our Other Bets are also pursuing initiatives with similar goals. For instance, as a part of our efforts in the Metro Phoenix area, Waymo is
working toward our goal of making transportation safer and easier for everyone while Verily is developing tools and platforms to improve health
outcomes.
Moonshots
Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to
irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we
acquired YouTube and Android and when we launched Chrome, but those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile
devices and a safer, popular browser. We continue to look toward the future and continue to invest for the long-term. As we said in the original
founders' letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success.
The power of machine learning
Across the company, machine learning and AI are increasingly driving many of our latest innovations. Within Google, our investments in
machine learning over a decade have enabled us to build products that are smarter and more helpful. For example, our investments in AI are
enabling doctors to detect cancer earlier. Machine learning powers the Google Assistant and many of our newer technologies.
Google
Serving our users
We have always been a company committed to building products that have the potential to improve the lives of millions of people. Our product
innovations have made our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. Google's core products and platforms,
such as Android, Chrome, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube each have over one billion monthly active users.
As the majority of Alphabet’s big bets continue to reside within Google, an important benefit of the shift to Alphabet has been the tremendous focus
that we’re able to have on Google’s many extraordinary opportunities.
Our products have come a long way since the company was founded more than two decades ago. Instead of just showing ten blue links in our
search results, we are increasingly able to provide direct answers — even if you're speaking your question using Voice Search — which makes it
quicker, easier and more natural to find what you're looking for. With Google Lens, you can use your phone’s camera to identify an unfamiliar
landmark or find a trailer

from a movie poster. Over time, we have also added other services that let you access information quickly and easily — like Google Maps, which
helps you navigate to a store while showing you current traffic conditions, or Google Photos, which helps you store and organize your photos.
This drive to make information more accessible and helpful has led us over the years to improve the discovery and creation of digital content,
on the web and through platforms like Google Play and YouTube. And with the migration to mobile, people are consuming more digital content by
watching more videos, playing more games, listening to more music, reading more books, and using more apps than ever before. Working with
content creators and partners, we continue to build new ways for people around the world to find great digital content.
Fueling all of these great digital experiences are powerful platforms and hardware. That’s why we continue to invest in platforms like our
Android mobile operating system, Chrome browser, Chrome operating system, and Daydream virtual reality platform, as well as growing our family
of great hardware devices. We see tremendous potential for devices to be helpful, make your life easier, and get better over time, by combining the
best of Google's AI, software, and hardware. This is reflected in our latest generation of hardware products like Pixel 4 phones and the Google Nest
Hub smart display. Creating beautiful products that people rely on every day is a journey that we are investing in for the long run.
Key to building helpful products for users is our commitment to keeping their data safe online. As the Internet evolves, we continue to invest in
our industry-leading security technologies and privacy tools, such as the addition of auto-delete controls to enable users to automatically delete
activity after 3 or 18 months and incognito mode in YouTube and Maps.
Google was a company built in the cloud. We continue to invest in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and AI. We see
significant opportunity in helping businesses enhance these strengths with features like data migration, modern development environments and
machine learning tools to provide enterprise-ready cloud services, including Google Cloud Platform and G Suite. Google Cloud Platform enables
developers to build, test, and deploy applications on Google’s highly scalable and reliable infrastructure. Our G Suite productivity tools — which
include apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, and more — are designed with real-time collaboration and machine intelligence to help people work
smarter. Because more and more of today’s great digital experiences are being built in the cloud, our Google Cloud products help businesses of all
sizes take advantage of the latest technology advances to operate more efficiently.
How we make money
The goal of our advertising products is to deliver relevant ads at just the right time and to give people useful commercial information, regardless
of the device they’re using. We also provide advertisers with tools that help them better attribute and measure their advertising campaigns. Our
advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses, and we offer a wide range of products across devices and formats. We
generate revenues primarily by delivering both performance advertising and brand advertising.
• Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click on, leading to direct engagement with advertisers. Most of
our performance advertisers pay us when a user engages in their ads. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while
driving measurable results. Our ads tools allow performance advertisers to create simple text-based ads that appear on Google properties
and the properties of Google Network Members. In addition, Google Network Members use our platforms to display relevant ads on their
properties, generating revenues when site visitors view or click on the ads. We continue to invest in our advertising programs and make
significant upgrades.
• Brand advertising helps enhance users' awareness of and affinity with advertisers' products and services, through videos, text, images,
and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific
audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns.
We have built a world-class ad technology platform for advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital marketing businesses. We
aim to ensure great user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies. We also
seek to improve the measurability of advertising so advertisers know when their campaigns are effective.
We have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. We focus on creating the best
advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, ranging from filtering out invalid traffic, removing billions of bad ads from our
systems every year to closely monitoring the sites, apps, and videos where ads appear and blacklisting them when necessary to ensure that ads do
not fund bad content.

We continue to look to the future and are making long-term investments that will grow revenues beyond advertising, including Google Cloud,
Google Play, hardware, and YouTube. We are also investing in research efforts in AI and quantum computing to foster innovation across our
businesses and create new opportunities.
Other Bets
Throughout Alphabet, we are also using technology to try and solve big problems across many industries. Alphabet’s investment in our portfolio
of Other Bets include emerging businesses at various stages of development, ranging from those in the research and development phase to those
that are in the beginning stages of commercialization, and our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses in the medium to long
term. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making
important strides in their industries. Revenues are primarily generated from internet and TV services, as well as licensing and R&D services.
Other Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors. We
are investing in our portfolio of Other Bets and being very deliberate about the focus, scale, and pace of investments.
Competition
Our business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable competition in every aspect of
our business, particularly from companies that seek to connect people with online information and provide them with relevant advertising. We face
competition from:
• General purpose search engines and information services, such as Baidu, Microsoft's Bing, Naver, Seznam, Verizon's Yahoo, and Yandex.
• Vertical search engines and e-commerce websites, such as Amazon and eBay (e-commerce), Booking's Kayak (travel queries), Microsoft's
LinkedIn (job queries), and WebMD (health queries). Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go
through Google.
• Social networks, such as Facebook, Snapchat, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service referrals,
rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.
• Other forms of advertising, such as billboards, magazines, newspapers, radio, and television. Our advertisers typically advertise in multiple
media, both online and offline.
• Other online advertising platforms and networks, including Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Facebook, that compete for advertisers that use
Google Ads, our primary auction-based advertising platform.
• Providers of digital video services, such as Amazon, Apple, AT&T, Disney, Facebook, Hulu, Netflix and TikTok.
In businesses that are further afield from our advertising business, we compete with companies that have longer operating histories and more
established relationships with customers and users. We face competition from:
• Other digital content and application platform providers, such as Amazon and Apple.
• Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary
platforms.
• Providers of enterprise cloud services, including Alibaba, Amazon, and Microsoft.
• Digital assistant providers, such as Amazon and Apple.
Competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to deliver and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across
our businesses. Specifically, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:
• Users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as
the general usefulness, security and availability of our products and services.
• Advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an
efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels.
• Content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from
advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.
Intellectual Property
7

--- Page 9 ---

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
We rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our
brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights. We
have also filed patent applications in the U.S. and foreign countries covering certain of our technology, and acquired patent assets to supplement our
portfolio. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our rights to other parties.
Culture and Employees
We take great pride in our culture. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and encourage the iteration of ideas to address complex technical
challenges. Transparency and open dialogue are central to how we work, and we aim to ensure that company news reaches our employees first
through internal channels.
Despite our rapid growth, we still cherish our roots as a startup and wherever possible empower employees to act on great ideas regardless of
their role or function within the company. We strive to hire great employees, with backgrounds and perspectives as diverse as those of our global
users. We work to provide an environment where these talented people can have fulfilling careers addressing some of the biggest challenges in
technology and society.
Our employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue investing in hiring talented
employees and to provide competitive compensation programs to our employees. As of December 31, 2019, we had 118,899 full-time employees.
Although we have work councils and statutory employee representation obligations in certain countries, our U.S. employees are not represented by
a labor union. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other
technical staff.
Ongoing Commitment to Sustainability
We strive to build sustainability into everything we do from designing and operating efficient data centers, advancing carbon-free energy,
creating sustainable workplaces, building better devices and services, empowering users with technology, and enabling a responsible supply chain.
Google has been carbon neutral since 2007 and we are the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world. In 2018, for the second
consecutive year, we matched 100% of our electricity consumption with renewable energy purchases, as reported in our 2019 Environmental
Report.
Some other 2019 highlights and achievements include:
• We made our largest corporate purchase of renewable energy: 18 new energy deals totaling 1,600 megawatts, which is anticipated to spur
the construction of more than $2 billion in new energy infrastructure.
• 100% of Nest products launched in 2019 include recycled plastic content and we launched carbon neutral shipping for Google’s direct
customers who buy a product on Google Shopping or purchase Made by Google hardware.
• The Environmental Insights Explorer is enabling municipalities — which represent more than 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions
according to the 2016 United Nations Habitat World Cities Report — to estimate emissions and develop climate action plans. In 2019, we
expanded this tool to more than 100 cities worldwide.
We believe that climate change is one of the most significant global challenges of our time. In 2017, we developed a climate resilience strategy,
which included conducting a climate scenario analysis. We have been on CDP’s (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project) Climate Change A list for
five consecutive years. We believe our CDP report reflects the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures
(TCFD).
More information on Google's approach to sustainability can be found in our annual sustainability reports. The content of our sustainability
reports are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described below, which
could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
Risks Specific to our Company
We generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising, and reduced spending by advertisers, a loss of partners, or new
and existing technologies that block ads online and/or affect our ability to customize ads could harm our business.
We generated over 83% of total revenues from the display of ads online in 2019. Many of our advertisers, companies that distribute our
products and services, digital publishers, and content providers can terminate their contracts with us at any time. These partners may not continue to
do business with us if we do not create more value (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand
awareness, or more effective monetization) than their available alternatives. Changes to our advertising policies and data privacy practices, as well
as changes to other companies’ advertising policies or practices may affect the advertising that we are able to provide, which could harm our
business. In addition, technologies have been developed that make customized ads more difficult or that block the display of ads altogether and
some providers of online services have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third-party digital
advertising. Failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisements effectively and competitively could harm our reputation, financial condition,
and operating results.
In addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Adverse
macroeconomic conditions can also have a material negative effect on the demand for advertising and cause our advertisers to reduce the amounts
they spend on advertising, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.
We face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, we may
not remain competitive, which could harm our business and operating results.
Our business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive. Our businesses face changing technologies, shifting user needs, and
frequent introductions of rival products and services. To compete successfully, we must accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver
innovative, relevant and useful products, services, and technologies in a timely manner. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to
innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services. We must continue to invest significant resources in research and development,
including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our technology and new and existing products and services.
We have many competitors in different industries. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and
established companies to emerging start-ups. Some competitors have longer operating histories in various sectors. They can use their experience
and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions, continuing to invest heavily in research and
development and in talent, aggressively initiating intellectual property claims (whether or not meritorious), and continuing to compete aggressively for
users, advertisers, customers, and content providers. Our competitors may be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we
can or may foresee the need for products and services before us. For example, we are investing significantly in subscription-based products and
services such as YouTube, which face intense competition from large experienced companies with well established relationships with users.
Our operating results may also suffer if our products and services are not responsive to the needs of our users, advertisers, publishers,
customers, and content providers. As technologies continue to develop, our competitors may be able to offer experiences that are, or that are seen
to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. This may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain
competitive. If our competitors
9

--- Page 11 ---

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, publishers, customers, and
content providers, our operating results could be harmed.
Our ongoing investment in new businesses, products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could disrupt our current
operations and harm our financial condition and operating results.
We have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. The investments that we are
making across Google and Other Bets reflect our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, advertisers,
publishers, customers, and content providers. Our investments in Google and Other Bets span a wide range of industries beyond online advertising.
Such investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and, in pursuing new strategies, we
may incur unanticipated liabilities. These endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including diversion of management resources
and, with respect to Other Bets, the use of alternative investment, governance, or compensation structures that may fail to adequately align
incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.
Within Google, we continue to invest heavily in hardware, including our smartphones and home devices, which is a highly competitive
market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, short product life
cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, and price and feature sensitivity on the
part of consumers and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively.
We are also devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our enterprise-ready cloud services, including Google Cloud Platform and
G Suite. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services and hire talent, particularly to support and
scale the Cloud salesforce. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery
models are competitive and evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives.
Within Other Bets, we are investing significantly in the areas of health, life sciences, and transportation, among others. These investment
areas face intense competition from large experienced and well-funded competitors and our offerings may not be able to compete effectively or to
operate at sufficient levels of profitability.
In addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use artificial intelligence and machine learning, raise ethical,
technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services. Because
all of these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not harm our
reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
Our revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future.
Our revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition and the continued
expansion of our business into a variety of new fields. Changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix,
and property mix and an increasing competition for advertising may also affect our advertising revenue growth rate. We may also experience a
decline in our revenue growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, if there is a decrease in the rate of adoption of our products, services,
and technologies, or due to deceleration or decline in demand for devices used to access our services, among other factors.
In addition to a decline in our revenue growth rate, we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a
variety of factors, such as the continued expansion of our business into new fields, including products and services such as hardware, Google
Cloud, Google Play, gaming, and subscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than
those we generate from advertising. We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing competition and
increased costs for many aspects of our business, including within advertising where changes such as device mix, property mix, and partner
agreements can affect margin. The margin we earn on revenues generated from our Google Network Members could also decrease in the future if
we pay a larger percentage of advertising fees to them. We may also pay increased TAC to our distribution partners as well as increased content
acquisition costs to content providers. We may also face an increase in infrastructure costs, supporting businesses such as Search, Google Cloud,
and YouTube. Additionally, our spend to promote new products and services or distribute certain products and services or increased investment in
our innovation efforts across Google and our Other Bets businesses may affect our operating margins.
Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be
indicative of our future performance.
10

Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services and
brand as well as affect our ability to compete.
Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of
our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual
property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet.
Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for
our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have adequate patent or copyright
protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of
the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.
We also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy of such trade secrets and other sensitive information could
be compromised, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets. We also face risks associated with our
trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word “Google” could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word
“search.” Some courts have ruled that "Google" is a protectable trademark, but it is possible that other courts, particularly those outside of the United
States, may reach a different determination. If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the
word “Google” to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.
Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual
property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do
business and harm our operating results.
Our business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base
of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.
Our strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands within Google and
Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products that better serve the needs of our users,
advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners. Our brands may be negatively affected by a number of factors, including, among
others, reputational issues, third-party content shared on our platforms, data privacy and security issues and developments, and product or technical
performance failures. For example, if we fail to appropriately respond to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our services or
objectionable practices by advertisers, or to otherwise adequately address user concerns, our users may lose confidence in our brands. Our brands
may also be negatively affected by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be false or misleading.
Furthermore, failure to maintain and enhance equity in our brands may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Our
success will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality, innovative products and services that
are truly useful and play a valuable role in a range of settings.
We face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could harm our financial condition,
operating results, and prospects.
We face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management, which could affect our ability to supply both our products
and our internet-based services.
We rely on other companies to manufacture many of our assemblies and finished products, to design certain of our components and parts, and
to participate in the distribution of our products and services. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these
companies with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to
financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them.
We may experience supply shortages and price increases driven by raw material availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry
allocations, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, natural disasters, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires,
and increased storm severity), and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers. We may experience shortages or other
supply chain disruptions that could negatively affect our operations. In addition, some of the components we use in our technical infrastructure and
products are available only from a single source or limited sources, and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms in the
event of a supply chain disruption. In addition, a significant hardware supply interruption could delay critical data center upgrades or expansions.
11

--- Page 13 ---

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
We may enter into long term contracts for materials and products that commit us to significant terms and conditions. We may be liable for
materials and products that are not consumed due to market acceptance, technological change, obsolescences, quality, product recalls, and
warranty issues. For instance, because many of our hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if
the volume of our hardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or
other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and negatively affect our financial results. Furthermore,
certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with
competitive advantages and may affect our supply.
Our products and services may have quality issues resulting from design, manufacturing, or operations. Sometimes, these issues may be
caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. If the quality of our products and services does not meet expectations or
our products or services are defective, it could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
We require our suppliers and business partners to comply with laws and, where applicable, our company policies, such as the Google Supplier
Code of Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing, but
we do not control them or their practices. Violations of law or unethical business practices could result in supply chain disruptions, canceled orders,
harm to key relationships, and damage to our reputation. Their failure to procure necessary license rights to intellectual property, could affect our
ability to sell our products or services and expose us to litigation or financial claims.
Interruption, interference with, or failure of our information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to
effectively provide our products and services, which could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. In addition,
complications with the design or implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system could harm our business
and operations.
The availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing operation of our information
technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage, interference, or interruption from terrorist attacks, natural
disasters, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires, and increased storm severity), power loss,
telecommunications failures, computer viruses, ransomware attacks, computer denial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to
harm or access our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes or other natural disasters. Our
data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and, in some cases, to potential disruptions resulting from
problems experienced by facility operators. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and disaster recovery planning cannot account for all
eventualities.
The occurrence of a natural disaster, closure of a facility, or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in lengthy
interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities, which
could result in interruptions in or failure of our services or systems.
In addition, we rely extensively on information systems and technology to manage our business and summarize operating results. We are in
the process of a multi-year implementation of a new ERP system, which will replace much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is
designed to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management, and provide timely
information to our management team. We may not be able to successfully implement the ERP system without experiencing delays, increased costs,
and other difficulties. Failure to successfully design and implement the new ERP system as planned could harm our business, financial condition,
and operating results. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or the ERP system does not operate as intended,
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be negatively affected.
Our international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, our financial condition, and operating
results.
Our international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue to grow internationally. International
revenues accounted for approximately 54% of our consolidated revenues in 2019. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our
international operations expose us to other risks, including the following:
• Restrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash
earned in countries outside the U.S.
12

--- Page 14 ---

• Import and export requirements, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, and customs classifications that may prevent us from offering products
or providing services to a particular market, or that could limit our ability to source assemblies and finished products from a particular
market, and may increase our operating costs.
• Longer payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud.
• Evolving foreign events, including Brexit, the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union (EU). Brexit may adversely affect our
revenues and could subject us to new regulatory costs and challenges (including the transfer of personal data between the EU and the
United Kingdom), in addition to other adverse effects that we are unable to effectively anticipate.
• Anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain payments to government
officials, violations of which could result in civil and criminal penalties.
• Uncertainty regarding liability for services and content, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent.
• Different employee/employer relationships, existence of works councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused by distance,
language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions.
Because we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in
exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Hedging programs are also
inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could harm our financial condition and operating results.
Risks Related to our Industry
People access the Internet through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to evolve with the advancement of technology
and user preferences. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our products and services developed for these new
interfaces, our business could be harmed.
People access the Internet through a growing variety of devices such as desktop computers, mobile phones, smartphones, laptops and tablets,
video game consoles, voice-activated speakers, wearables, automobiles, and television-streaming devices. Our products and services may be less
popular on these new interfaces. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and
services may not be available on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices. In
addition, search queries are increasingly being undertaken via voice-activated speakers, apps, social media or other platforms, which could harm
our business. It is hard to predict the challenges we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products
and services. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to creating and supporting products and services across multiple platforms and
devices. Failing to attract and retain a substantial number of new device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and users, or failing to
develop products and technologies that work well on new devices and platforms, could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results
and ability to capture future business opportunities.
Data privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could damage our reputation, cause us to incur
significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services. Software bugs or defects,
security breaches, and attacks on our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our
users and customers’ ability to use our products and services, harming our business operations and reputation.
Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other data-privacy-related
matters, even if unfounded, could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our policies and practices may change over time as
expectations regarding privacy and data change.
Our products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information, and bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in
our products and services, and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of this information, improper use and disclosure of such information,
litigation, and other potential liability. Systems and control failures, security breaches, failure to comply with our privacy policies, and/or inadvertent
disclosure of user data could result in government and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business, and
impair our ability to attract and retain users or customers. We expect to continue to expend significant resources to maintain security protections that
shield against bugs, theft, misuse, or security vulnerabilities or breaches.
We experience cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems on a regular basis. We may experience future
security issues, whether due to employee error or malfeasance or system errors or
13

--- Page 15 ---

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
vulnerabilities in our or other parties’ systems, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure. Government inquiries and enforcement
actions, litigation, and adverse press coverage could harm our business. We may be unable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or
implement adequate preventative measures. Attacks and security issues could also compromise trade secrets and other sensitive information,
harming our business.
While we have dedicated significant resources to privacy and security incident response capabilities, including dedicated worldwide incident
response teams, our response process may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not respond quickly
enough, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident. As a result, we may suffer significant legal, reputational, or financial exposure, which could
harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.
Our ongoing investments in safety, security, and content review will likely continue to identify abuse of our platforms and misuse of
user data.
In addition to our efforts to mitigate cyber attacks, we are making significant investments in safety, security, and content review efforts to
combat misuse of our services and unauthorized access to user data by third parties, including investigations and review of platform applications
that could access the information of users of our services. As a result of these efforts, we could discover incidents of unnecessary access to or
misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties. We may not discover all such incidents or activity, whether as a result of our data
limitations, including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services, the scale of activity on our platform, or other factors, and we may be notified of
such incidents or activity via third parties. Such incidents and activities may include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent
with our terms, contracts or policies, the existence of false or undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper ad purchases, activities that
threaten people’s safety on- or offline, or instances of spamming, scraping, or spreading disinformation. We may also be unsuccessful in our efforts
to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate any such incidents. Any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and
engagement, harm our reputation and brands, require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and adversely
affect our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could
result in monetary penalties and damages, divert management’s time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.
Problematic content, including low-quality user-generated content, web spam, content farms, and other violations of our guidelines
could affect the quality of our services, which could damage our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our
products and services.
We, like others in the industry, face violations of our content guidelines, including sophisticated attempts by bad actors to manipulate our
hosting and advertising systems to fraudulently generate revenues, or to otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest or
intent. While we invest significantly in efforts to promote high-quality and relevant results and to detect and prevent low-quality content and invalid
traffic, we may be unable to adequately detect and prevent such abuses.
Many websites violate or attempt to violate our guidelines, including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search results than our search
engine's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Such efforts (known as “web spam”) may affect the quality of content on our
platforms and lead them to display false, misleading or undesirable content.
Although English-language web spam in our search results has been reduced, and web spam in most other languages is limited, we expect
web spammers will continue to seek inappropriate ways to improve their rankings. We continuously combat web spam in our search results,
including through indexing technology that makes it harder for spam-like, less useful web content to rank highly. We also continue to invest in and
deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam from abusing our platforms.
We also face other challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including content farms, which are websites that generate large
quantities of low-quality content to help them improve their search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes focused on low-
quality websites.
If we fail to detect and prevent an increase in problematic content, it could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce use
of our platforms, harming our financial condition or operating results. It may also subject us to litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could result in
monetary penalties and damages, divert management’s time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.

Our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be
able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and
the loss of users and advertisers.
Our products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to
work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access
marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service
providers. Some of these providers have taken, or have stated that they may take measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user
access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, or by charging
increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms of discrimination by
internet access providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists in the United States and elsewhere regarding such protections. For example, in
2018 the United States Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules, which could lead internet access providers to restrict,
block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services. In addition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been
subject to government-initiated restrictions or blockages. Such interference could result in a loss of existing users, customers and advertisers,
goodwill, and increased costs, and could impair our ability to attract new users, customers and advertisers, thereby harming our business.
Risks Related to Laws and Regulations
We are subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny as well as changes in public policies governing a wide range of topics that may
negatively affect our business.
We and other companies in the technology industry are experiencing increased regulatory scrutiny. For instance, various regulatory agencies,
including competition, consumer protection, and privacy authorities, are reviewing aspects of our products and services. We continue to cooperate
with these investigations. Prior, existing, and new investigations have in the past and may in the future result in substantial fines and penalties,
changes to our products and services, alterations to our business operations, and civil litigation, all of which could harm our business, reputation,
financial condition, and operating results.
Changes in international and local social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of
topics may increase our cost of doing business, limit our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services, and cause us
to change our business practices. Further, our investment in a variety of new fields, including the health industry and payment services, also raises a
number of new regulatory issues. These factors could harm our business and operating results in material ways.
A variety of new and existing laws and/or interpretations could harm our business.
We are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. New laws and regulations (or
new interpretations or applications of existing laws and regulations in a manner inconsistent with our practices) may make our products and services
less useful, limit our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products and services, require us to incur substantial costs, expose us
to unanticipated civil or criminal liability, or cause us to change our business practices. These laws and regulations are evolving and involve matters
central to our business, including, among others:
• Competition laws and regulations around the world.
• Privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 that came into effect in January of 2020, which gives new data privacy
rights to California residents, and SB-327 in California, which regulates the security of data in connection with internet connected devices.
• Data protection laws passed by many states within the U.S. and by certain countries regarding notification to data subjects and/or regulators
when there is a security breach of personal data.
• Copyright laws, such as the EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market (EUCD) of April 17, 2019, which increases the liability of
content-sharing services with respect to content uploaded by their users. It has also created a new property right in news publications that
will limit the ability of some online services to interact with or present such content. Each EU Member State must implement the EUCD by
June 7, 2021. In addition, there are new constraining licensing regimes that limit our ability to operate with respect to copyright protected
works.
• Data localization laws, which generally mandate that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored and/or processed within
that country.
15

--- Page 17 ---

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
• Various U.S. and international laws that govern the distribution of certain materials to children and regulate the ability of online services to
collect information from minors.
• Various laws with regard to content removal and disclosure obligations, such as the Network Enforcement Act in Germany, which may affect
our businesses and operations and may subject us to significant fines if such laws are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with
our practices or when we may not proactively discover such content due to the scale of third-party content and the limitations of existing
technologies. Other countries, including Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom, have implemented or are considering similar
legislation imposing penalties for failure to remove certain types of content.
In addition, the applicability and scope of these laws, as interpreted by the courts, remain uncertain and could harm our business. For example:
• We rely on statutory safe harbors, as set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the United States and the E-Commerce Directive in
Europe, against copyright liability for various linking, caching, and hosting activities. Any legislation or court rulings affecting these safe
harbors may adversely affect us.
• Court decisions such as the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on May 13, 2014 on the ‘right to be forgotten,’
which allows individuals to demand that Google remove search results about them in certain instances, may limit the content we can show
to our users and impose significant operational burdens.
• Court decisions that require Google to remove links not just in the jurisdiction of the issuing court, but for all versions of the search engine
worldwide, including in locations where the content at issue is lawful, may limit the content we can show to our users and impose significant
operational burdens. The Supreme Court of Canada issued such a decision against Google in June 2017, and others could treat its decision
as persuasive. With respect to the ‘right to be forgotten,’ a follow-up case of the CJEU on September 24, 2019 ruled that a search engine
operator is not required to remove links from all versions of the search engine worldwide, but the court also noted in some cases, removal of
links from all versions of the search engine available from the EU (including non-EU specific versions) may be required.
The introduction of new businesses, products, services, and technologies, our activities in certain jurisdictions, or other actions we take may
subject us to additional laws and regulations. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the
future. Any failure on our part to comply with laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and
may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties.
We are subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings that may harm our business, financial condition,
and operating results.
We are subject to claims, suits, and government investigations involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, consumer
protection, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or
publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Due to our manufacturing and sale of an expanded suite of products, including hardware as well
as Google Cloud offerings, we may also be subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims
related to product defects, among other litigation. We may also be subject to claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other
environmental impacts, or service disruptions or failures.
Any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources,
negative publicity and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant
judgment. The resolution of one or more such proceedings has resulted in, and may in the future result in, additional substantial fines, penalties,
injunctions, and other sanctions that could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.
We may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content.
Our products and services let users exchange information, advertise products and services, conduct business, and engage in various online
activities. We also place advertisements displayed on other companies’ websites, and we offer third-party products, services, and/or content. The
law relating to the liability of online service providers for others’ activities on their services is still somewhat unsettled both within the U.S. and
internationally. Claims have been brought against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright and trademark infringement, unfair
competition, unlawful activity, torts, fraud, or other legal theories based on the nature and content of information available on or via our services.
16

We may be subject to claims by virtue of our involvement in hosting, transmitting, marketing, branding, or providing access to content created
by third parties. Defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources, may
result in monetary liabilities or penalties, and may require us to change our business in an adverse manner.
Privacy and data protection regulations are complex and rapidly evolving areas. Adverse interpretations of these laws could harm
our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
Authorities around the world have adopted and are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection
and limits on encryption of user data. Adverse legal rulings, legislation, or regulation could result in fines and orders requiring that we change our
data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to provide services, harming our business operations. Complying with these
evolving laws could result in substantial costs and harm the quality of our products and services, negatively affecting our business.
Recent legal developments in Europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding transfers of personal data from Europe to the United
States. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or
related to products and services that we offer to EU users or customers, or the monitoring of their behavior in the EU. The GDPR creates a range of
new compliance obligations.
Ensuring compliance with the GDPR is an ongoing commitment that involves substantial costs, and despite our efforts, governmental
authorities or others have asserted and may continue to assert that our business practices fail to comply with its requirements. If our operations are
found to violate GDPR requirements, we may incur substantial fines, have to change our business practices, and face reputational harm, any of
which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In particular, serious breaches of the GDPR can result in administrative fines of up to
4% of annual worldwide revenues. Fines of up to 2% of annual worldwide revenues can be levied for other specified violations.
The EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks allow U.S. companies that self-certify to the U.S. Department of Commerce and
publicly commit to comply with specified requirements to import personal data from the EU and Switzerland. However, these frameworks face a
number of legal challenges and their validity remains subject to legal, regulatory, and political developments in both Europe and the U.S. The
potential invalidation of data transfer mechanisms could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data
outside of the EEA.
These developments create some uncertainty, and compliance obligations could cause us to incur costs or harm the operations of our products
and services in ways that harm our business.
We face, and may continue to face intellectual property and other claims that could be costly to defend, result in significant damage
awards or other costs (including indemnification awards), and limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.
We, like other internet, technology and media companies, hold large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and are
frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent-holding
companies may frequently seek to generate income from patents they have obtained by bringing claims against us. As we have grown, the number
of intellectual property claims against us has increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products, services, and technologies.
We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products,
services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Other parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing
claims in U.S. and international courts and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease-and-desist orders, which could
limit our ability to sell our products or services in the U.S. or elsewhere if our products or services or those of our customers or suppliers are found to
infringe the intellectual property subject to the claims. Adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of monetary damages, costly
royalty or licensing agreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or
services. They may also cause us to change our business practices and require development of non-infringing products, services, or technologies,
which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business.
Many of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to defend against certain intellectual property
infringement claims and in some cases indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which could result in
increased costs for defending such claims or significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners
may also discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of
revenues and adversely affect our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers, when obtainable, may not
cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers arising from intellectual property
17

--- Page 19 ---

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
infringement claims. Furthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for
certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual property claims.
Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. To the extent such claims
are successful, they may harm our business, including our product and service offerings, financial condition, or operating results.
Risks Related to Ownership of our Stock
We cannot guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that any share repurchase program will
enhance long-term stockholder value, and share repurchases could increase the volatility of the price of our stock and could diminish our
cash reserves.
In January 2018, January 2019, and July 2019, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $8.6 billion,
$12.5 billion, and $25.0 billion of its Class C capital stock, respectively. Share repurchases pursuant to the January 2018 and January 2019
authorizations were completed in 2019. As of December 31, 2019, $20.8 billion remains available for repurchase. Our repurchase program does not
have an expiration date and does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. Our
share repurchase program could affect the price of our stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may
result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock.
The concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters.
Our Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A common stock has one vote per share, and our Class C capital stock has no
voting rights. As of December 31, 2019, Larry Page and Sergey Brin beneficially owned approximately 84.3% of our outstanding Class B common
stock, which represented approximately 51.2% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. Through their stock ownership, Larry and
Sergey have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate
transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C capital stock
carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C capital stock, including in future stock-based acquisition
transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could continue Larry and Sergey’s current relative voting power and their ability to
elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. This concentrated control limits or
severely restricts other stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and we may take actions that some of our stockholders do not view as
beneficial, which could reduce the market price of our Class A common stock and our Class C capital stock.
Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.
Provisions in Alphabet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in
our management. These provisions include the following:
• Our certificate of incorporation provides for a tri-class capital stock structure. As a result of this structure, Larry and Sergey have significant
influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a
merger or other sale of our company or our assets. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger,
takeover, or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial. As noted above, the issuance of the Class C
capital stock could have the effect of continuing the influence of Larry and Sergey.
• Our board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation,
death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors.
• Our stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be
able to take certain actions without holding a stockholders' meeting.
• Our certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect
director candidates.
• Stockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be
acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of
proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.
18

--- Page 20 ---

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
• Our board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock. The ability to issue undesignated
preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could
impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.
As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not
engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years
or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an
acquisition of us.
General Risks
Our operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of
expectations.
Our operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results
on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our
quarterly, year-to-date, and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may differ significantly from our historical rates. Our operating results
in future quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events could cause our stock price to fall. Each of the risk factors listed in this section in
addition to the following factors may affect our operating results:
• Our ability to continue to attract and retain users and customers to our products and services.
• Our ability to attract user and/or customer adoption of, and generate significant revenues from, new products, services, and technologies in
which we have invested considerable time and resources.
• Our ability to monetize traffic on Google properties and our Google Network Members' properties across various devices.
• Revenue fluctuations caused by changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, and property
mix.
• The amount of revenues and expenses generated and incurred in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and our ability to manage the resulting
risk through our foreign exchange risk management program.
• The amount and timing of operating costs and expenses and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and expansion of our
businesses, operations, and infrastructure.
• Our focus on long-term goals over short-term results.
• The results of our acquisitions, divestitures, and our investments in risky projects, including new businesses, products, services, and
technologies.
• Our ability to keep our products and services operational at a reasonable cost and without service interruptions.
• The seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising spending, and underlying business trends such as traditional retail seasonality. Our
rapid growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our business. As our growth rate has slowed, the cyclicality and
seasonality in our business has become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuate.
• Geopolitical events, including trade disputes.
• Changes in global business or macroeconomic conditions.
Because our businesses are changing and evolving, our historical operating results may not be useful to you in predicting our future operating
results.
Acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences
that may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.
Acquisitions, joint ventures, investments and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, and these
transactions could be material to our financial condition and operating results. We expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions
regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions, which could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. Some of the areas
where we face risks include:
• Diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic transactions.
• Failure to successfully integrate and further develop the acquired business or technology.
19

--- Page 21 ---

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
• Implementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company.
• Integration of the acquired company’s accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and coordination of product,
engineering, and sales and marketing functions.
• Transition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms.
• Failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions placed upon approval that could,
among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or
strategic goals of a transaction.
• In the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular
economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.
• Cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of employees
from the businesses we acquire.
• Liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, data privacy and
security issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities.
• Litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former
stockholders, or other third parties.
Our failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and other strategic
transactions could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.
Our acquisitions and other strategic transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt,
contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of
which could harm our financial condition or operating results. Also, the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic
transactions may not materialize. In connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for
certain potential liabilities, which may harm our financial condition or operating results.
If we were to lose the services of key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.
Our future success depends in large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. For instance, Sundar
Pichai is critical to the overall management of Alphabet and its subsidiaries and plays an important role in the development of our technology. He
also plays a key role in maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will
employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of key personnel could seriously harm our business.
We rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain
our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively.
Our performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to
identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified
employees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our
equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Our
continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.
In addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization grows, and we are required
to implement more complex organizational management structures, particularly in light of our holding company structure, adverse changes to our
corporate culture could harm our business operations.
In preparing our financial statements, we incorporate valuation methodologies that are subjective in nature and valuations may
fluctuate over time.
We measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt investments, certain other instruments including stock-based compensation awards
settled in the stock of certain Other Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
The determination of fair value involves use of appropriate valuation methods and certain unobservable inputs, require management judgment and
estimation, and may change over time.
20

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
As it relates to our non-marketable investments, the market values can be negatively affected by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses,
performance and financial results of the underlying companies, foreign exchange rates, changes in interest rates, including changes that may result
from the implementation of new benchmark rates that replace LIBOR, the effect of new or changing regulations, the stock market in general, or other
factors.
Since January 2018, we adjust the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments to fair value for observable transactions of identical
or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairments. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are
recognized in other income (expense), which increases the volatility of our other income (expense).
As a result of these factors, the value or liquidity of our cash equivalents, as well as our marketable and non-marketable securities could
decline and result in a material impairment, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
We could be subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax
liabilities.
Our future income taxes could be negatively affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates
and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain
hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, changes in the valuation of
our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles (including changes in the interpretation of existing
laws), as well as certain discrete items.
In addition, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have received, and may in
the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions, including in Europe, on various tax-related assertions, such as transfer-pricing adjustments
or permanent-establishment claims. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and
financial condition and could require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. It may also subject us to additional
litigation and regulatory inquiries, resulting in the diversion of management’s time and attention. In addition, the determination of our worldwide
provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations for which the
ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts
recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.
Furthermore, due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws, or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant
changes in ways that impair our financial results. In particular, France, Italy, and other countries have enacted or are considering digital services
taxes, which could lead to inconsistent and potentially overlapping international tax regimes. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development recently released a proposal relating to its initiative for modernizing international tax rules, with the goal of having different countries
enact legislation to implement a modernized and aligned international tax framework, but there can be no guarantee that this will occur.
The trading price for our Class A common stock and non-voting Class C capital stock may continue to be volatile.
The trading price of our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile. For example, from January 1,
2019 through December 31, 2019, the closing price of our Class A common stock ranged from $1,025.47 per share to $1,362.47 per share, and the
closing price of our Class C capital stock ranged from $1,016.06 to $1,361.17 per share.
In addition to the factors discussed in this report, the trading price of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock may fluctuate widely
in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, among others:
• Quarterly variations in our operating results or those of our competitors.
• Announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, new products, significant contracts, commercial
relationships, or capital commitments.
• Recommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates.
• Announcements about our earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations, the risk of which is enhanced because it is our policy not
to give guidance on earnings.
• Announcements by our competitors of their earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations.

• Commentary by industry and market professionals about our products, strategies, and other matters affecting our business and results,
regardless of its accuracy.
• The volume of shares of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock available for public sale.
• Sales of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock by us or by our stockholders (including sales by our directors, executive officers,
and other employees).
• Short sales, hedging, and other derivative transactions on shares of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock.
• The perceived values of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock relative to one another.
• Any share repurchase program.
In addition, the stock market in general, which can be affected by various factors, including overall economic and political conditions, and the
market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or
disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.
These broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our Class A common stock and our Class C capital stock, regardless of
our actual operating performance.
ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
Not applicable.
ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
Our headquarters are located in Mountain View, California. We also own and lease office and building space in the surrounding areas near our
headquarters, which we believe is sufficient to accommodate anticipated future growth. In addition, we own and lease office/building space and
research and development sites around the world, primarily in North America, Europe, South America, and Asia. We own and operate data centers
in the U.S., Europe, South America, and Asia. We believe our existing facilities, both owned and leased, are in good condition and suitable for the
conduct of our business.
ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

PART II
ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF
EQUITY SECURITIES
As of October 2, 2015, Alphabet Inc. became the successor issuer of Google Inc. pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act. Our
Class A common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GOOG” since August 19, 2004 and under the symbol
"GOOGL" since April 3, 2014. Prior to August 19, 2004, there was no public market for our stock. Our Class B common stock is neither listed nor
traded. Our Class C capital stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GOOG” since April 3, 2014.
Holders of Record
As of December 31, 2019, there were approximately 2,455 and 2,030 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock and Class C capital
stock, respectively. Because many of our shares of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock are held by brokers and other institutions on
behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders. As of December 31, 2019,
there were approximately 66 stockholders of record of our Class B common stock.
Dividend Policy
We have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common or capital stock. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the
long term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace and form of capital return to
stockholders.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial
statements and related notes included under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We have omitted discussion of 2017 results where it would be redundant to the discussion previously included in Part II, Item 7 of our 2018
Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended.
Trends in Our Business
The following trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future
results:
• Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.
The continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business since inception, contributing to revenue
growth, and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our business.
• Users are increasingly using diverse devices and modalities to access our products and services, and our advertising revenues
are increasingly coming from new formats.
Our users are accessing the Internet via diverse devices and modalities, such as smartphones, wearables and smart home devices, and want
to feel connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We seek to expand our products and services to stay in front of these trends in
order to maintain and grow our business.
We generate our advertising revenues increasingly from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising formats, and the margins
from the advertising revenues from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search.
Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures our revenues may be affected. For example, growth in the global
smartphone market has slowed due to various factors, including increased market saturation in developed countries, which can affect our mobile
advertising revenue growth rates.
We expect TAC paid to our distribution partners to increase as our revenues grow and to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic
mix; partner mix; partner agreement terms; and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points.
We expect these trends to continue to put pressure on our overall margins and affect our revenue growth rates.
• As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings which may affect our monetization.
As interactions between users and advertisers change and as online user behavior evolves, we continue to expand and evolve our product
offerings to serve their changing needs. Over time, we expect our monetization trends to fluctuate. For example, we have seen an increase in
YouTube engagement ads, which monetize at a lower rate than traditional search ads.
• As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets continue to increase and
movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues.
The shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., including in emerging markets,
and we continue to develop localized versions of our products and relevant advertising programs useful to our users in these markets. This has led
to a trend of increased revenues from international markets over time and we expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance
in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could impact our margins as developing markets initially
monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.
Our international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this
program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.
27

--- Page 29 ---

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
• The portion of our revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing and may affect margins.
Non-advertising revenues have grown over time. We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings to our users through
products and services like Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware products, and YouTube subscriptions. Across these initiatives, we currently derive
non-advertising revenues primarily from sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees,
including fees received for Google Cloud offerings and subscription and other services. The margins on these revenues vary significantly and may
be lower than the margins on our advertising revenues. A number of our Other Bets initiatives are in their initial development stages, and as such,
the sources of revenues from these businesses could change over time and the revenues could be volatile.
• As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures.
We continue to make significant R&D investments in areas of strategic focus such as advertising, cloud, machine learning, and search, as well
as in new products and services. In addition, our capital expenditures have grown over the last several years. We expect this trend to continue in the
long term as we invest heavily in land and buildings for data centers and offices, and information technology infrastructure, which includes servers
and network equipment.
In addition, acquisitions remain an important part of our strategy and use of capital, and we expect to continue to spend cash on acquisitions
and other investments. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings, as well as expand our expertise in engineering
and other functional areas.
• Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.
Our employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees around
the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs to our employees.
Executive Overview of Results
Below are our key financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (consolidated unless otherwise noted):
• Revenues of $161.9 billion and revenue growth of 18% year over year, constant currency revenue growth of 20% year over year.
• Google segment revenues of $160.7 billion with revenue growth of 18% year over year and Other Bets revenues of $659 million with
revenue growth of 11% year over year.
• Revenues from the United States, EMEA, APAC, and Other Americas were $74.8 billion, $50.6 billion, $26.9 billion, and $9.0 billion,
respectively.
• Cost of revenues was $71.9 billion, consisting of TAC of $30.1 billion and other cost of revenues of $41.8 billion. Our TAC as a percentage
of advertising revenues (TAC rate) was 22.3%.
• Operating expenses (excluding cost of revenues) were $55.7 billion.
• Income from operations was $34.2 billion.
• Other income (expense), net, was $5.4 billion.
• Effective tax rate was 13%.
• Net income was $34.3 billion with diluted net income per share of $49.16.
• Operating cash flow was $54.5 billion.
• Capital expenditures were $23.5 billion.
• Number of employees was 118,899 as of December 31, 2019. The majority of new hires during the year were engineers and product
managers. By product area, the largest headcount additions were in Google Cloud and Search.
Information about Segments
We operate our business in multiple operating segments. Google is our only reportable segment. None of our other segments meet the
quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, the other operating segments are combined and disclosed as Other Bets.
28

--- Page 30 ---

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
Our reported segments are:
• Google – Google includes our main products such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Play, Search,
and YouTube. Our technical infrastructure is also included in Google. Google generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps,
in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings
and subscription-based products.
• Other Bets – Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Other Bets includes Access,
Calico, CapitalG, GV, Verily, Waymo, and X, among others. Revenues from the Other Bets are derived primarily through the sales of
internet and TV services through Access as well as licensing and R&D services through Verily.

reclassified to conform with current period presentation.

Google advertising revenues
Our advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google properties and the change in impressions
and cost-per-impression on Google Network Members' properties and the correlation between these items, have been affected and may continue to
be affected by various factors, including:
• advertiser competition for keywords;
• changes in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;
• changes in device mix;
• changes in foreign currency exchange rates;
• fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;
• general economic conditions;
• seasonality; and
• traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels.
Our advertising revenue growth rate has been affected over time as a result of a number of factors, including challenges in maintaining our
growth rate as revenues increase to higher levels; changes in our product mix; changes in advertising quality or formats and delivery; the evolution
of the online advertising market; increasing competition; our investments in new business strategies; query growth rates; and shifts in the geographic
mix of our revenues. We also expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving user preferences, the acceptance by users
of our products and services as they are delivered on diverse devices and modalities, our ability to create a seamless experience for both users and
advertisers, and movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

(1) YouTube non-advertising revenues are included in Google other revenues.
Google advertising revenues are generated on our Google properties (including Google Search & other properties and YouTube) and Google
Network Members’ properties. Google advertising revenues consist primarily of the following:
• Google Search & other consists of revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search
distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.) and other Google owned and operated
properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;
• YouTube ads consists of revenues generated primarily on YouTube properties; and
• Google Network Members' properties consist of revenues generated primarily on Google Network Members' properties participating in
AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.
Google Search & other
Our Google Search & other revenues increased $12,819 million from 2018 to 2019. The growth was primarily driven by interrelated factors
including increases in search queries resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, continued growth in
advertiser activity, and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery. Revenue growth was partially offset by the general strengthening of
the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.
Our Google Search & other revenues increased $15,485 million from 2017 to 2018. The growth was primarily driven by increases in mobile
search resulting from ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, as well as continued growth in advertiser activity. Growth was also driven by
improvements in ad formats and delivery, primarily on desktop. Additionally, revenue growth was favorably affected by the general weakening of the
U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.
YouTube ads
YouTube ads revenues increased $3,994 million from 2018 to 2019 and increased $3,005 million from 2017 to 2018. The largest contributors to
the growth during both periods were our direct response and brand advertising products, both of which benefited from improvements to ad formats
and delivery and increased advertiser spending.
Google Network Members' properties
Our Google Network Members' properties revenues increased $1,537 million from 2018 to 2019. The growth was primarily driven by strength in
both AdManager (included in what was previously referred to as programmatic advertising buying) and AdMob, partially offset by the general
strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.
Our Google Network Members' properties revenues increased $2,394 million from 2017 to 2018, primarily driven by strength in both AdMob
and AdManager, offset by a decline in our traditional AdSense businesses. Additionally, the growth was favorably affected by the general weakening
of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.
Use of Monetization Metrics
Paid clicks for our Google properties represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users related to searches on
Google.com and other owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play; and viewed YouTube engagement ads
(certain YouTube ad formats are not included in our click or impression based metrics). Impressions for our Google Network Members' properties
include impressions displayed to users served on Google Network Members' properties participating primarily in AdMob, AdSense and Google Ad
Manager.
Cost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average amount we charge
advertisers for each engagement by users.

Cost-per-impression is defined as impression-based and click-based revenues divided by our total number of impressions and represents the
average amount we charge advertisers for each impression displayed to users.
As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of
paid clicks on our Google properties and the number of impressions on Google Network Members’ properties and for identifying the revenues
generated by click activity on our Google properties and the revenues generated by impression activity on Google Network Members’ properties.
Google properties
The following table presents changes in our paid clicks and cost-per-click (expressed as a percentage):
Year Ended December 31,
2018 2019
Paid clicks change 62 % 23 %
Cost-per-click change (25)% (7)%
The number of paid clicks through our advertising programs on Google properties increased from 2018 to 2019 due to growth in views of
YouTube engagement ads; increase in clicks due to interrelated factors, including an increase in search queries resulting from ongoing growth in
user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices; continued growth in advertiser activity; and improvements we have made in ad formats and
delivery. The positive effect on our revenues from an increase in paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our
advertisers. The decrease in cost-per-click was primarily driven by continued growth in YouTube engagement ads where cost-per-click remains
lower than on our other advertising platforms. Cost-per-click was also affected by changes in device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product changes,
product mix, property mix, and fluctuations of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.

The following table presents changes in our impressions and cost-per-impression (expressed as a percentage):
Year Ended December 31,
2018 2019
Impressions change 2% 9%
Cost-per-impression change 12% 1%
Impressions increased from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to growth in AdManager. The cost-per-impression was relatively unchanged due to a
combination of factors including ongoing product and policy changes and improvements we have made in ad formats and delivery, changes in
device mix, geographic mix, product mix, property mix, and fluctuations of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.
Google Cloud
The following table presents our Google Cloud revenues (in millions):

Google Cloud $ 4,056 $ 5,838 $ 8,918
Google Cloud revenues as a percentage of Google segment revenues 3.7% 4.3% 5.5%
Google Cloud revenues consist primarily of revenues from Cloud offerings, including
• Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which includes infrastructure, data and analytics, and other services
• G Suite productivity tools; and
• other enterprise cloud services.
Our Google Cloud revenues increased $3,080 million from 2018 to 2019 and increased $1,782 million from 2017 to 2018. The growth during
both periods was primarily driven by continued strength in our GCP and G Suite offerings. Our infrastructure and our data and analytics platform
products have been the largest drivers of growth in GCP.

Use of Constant Currency Revenues and Constant Currency Revenue Growth
The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons. Our international
revenues are favorably affected as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably affected as the U.S. dollar
strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. Our revenues are also favorably affected by net hedging gains and unfavorably affected by net
hedging losses.
We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues and constant currency revenue growth for financial and operational decision-making and as
a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to U.S. Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) results helps improve

the ability to understand our performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating
results.
Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define
constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to
determine the constant currency revenue growth on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period
revenues using prior period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.
Constant currency revenue growth (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by determining the increase in current period revenues over prior
period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded
from revenues of both periods.
These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant
currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of
performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

Costs and Expenses
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues consists of TAC which are paid to Google Network Members primarily for ads displayed on their properties and amounts paid
to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile
carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers.
The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network Members' properties are significantly higher
than the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google properties because most of the advertiser revenues
from ads served on Google Network Members’ properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network Members.
Additionally, other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding TAC) includes the following:
• Content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution
on YouTube advertising and subscription services and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated
or a flat fee);
• Expenses associated with our data centers and other operations (including bandwidth, compensation expenses (including stock-based
compensation (SBC)), depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs); and
• Inventory related costs for hardware we sell.
The following tables present our cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2018 2019
TAC $ 26,726 $ 30,089
Other cost of revenues 32,823 41,807
Total cost of revenues $ 59,549 $ 71,896
Total cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues 43.5% 44.4%
Cost of revenues increased $12,347 million from 2018 to 2019. The increase was due to increases in other cost of revenues and TAC of
$8,984 million and $3,363 million, respectively.
The increase in other cost of revenues from 2018 to 2019 was due to an increase in data center and other operations costs. Additionally, there
was an increase in content acquisition costs for YouTube consistent with the growth in YouTube revenues.
The increase in TAC from 2018 to 2019 was due to increases in TAC paid to distribution partners and to Google Network Members, primarily
driven by growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate decreased from 22.9% to 22.3%, primarily due to the favorable revenue mix shift from
Google Network Members' properties to Google properties. The TAC rate on Google properties revenues increased primarily due to the ongoing
shift to mobile, which carries higher TAC because more mobile searches are channeled through paid access points. The TAC rate on Google
Network revenues decreased primarily due to changes in product mix to products that carry a lower TAC rate.
Over time, cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues may be affected by a number of factors, including the following:
• The amount of TAC paid to Google Network Members, which is affected by a combination of factors such as geographic mix, product mix,
revenue share terms, and fluctuations of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies;
• The amount of TAC paid to distribution partners, which is affected by changes in device mix, geographic mix, partner mix, partner
agreement terms such as revenue share arrangements, and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points;
• Relative revenue growth rates of Google properties and Google Network Members' properties;
• Costs associated with our data centers and other operations to support ads, Google Cloud, Search, YouTube and other products;
• Content acquisition costs, which are primarily affected by the relative growth rates in our YouTube advertising and subscription revenues;
• Costs related to hardware sales; and
• Increased proportion of non-advertising revenues, which generally have higher costs of revenues, relative to our advertising revenues.

• Professional services fees primarily related to audit, information technology consulting, outside legal, and outsourcing services.
General and administrative expenses increased $2,628 million from 2018 to 2019. The increase was primarily due to an increase in legal-
related expenses of $1,157 million, including a charge of $554 million from a legal settlement in 2019 and the effect of a legal settlement gain
recorded in 2018. Additionally, there was an increase in compensation expenses (including SBC) and facilities-related costs of $687 million, largely
resulting from a 19% increase in headcount.
Performance fees of $1,203 million have been reclassified from general and administrative expenses to other income (expense), net, for 2018
to conform with current period presentation. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for further details.
Over time, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues may be affected by discrete items such as legal settlements.
European Commission Fines
In July 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google's Android-related distribution agreements infringed European
competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018) fine, which was accrued in the second quarter of 2018.
In March 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google had with AdSense for Search
partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) fine, which was accrued in
the first quarter of 2019.
Please refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for

Other Income (Expense), Net
The following table presents other income (expense), net, (in millions):

2018 2019
Other income (expense), net $ 7,389 $ 5,394
Other income (expense), net, as a percentage of revenues 5.4% 3.3%
Other income (expense), net, decreased $1,995 million from 2018 to 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in gains on
equity securities, which were $2,649 million in 2019 as compared to $5,460 million in 2018. The majority of the gains in both periods were
unrealized. The effect of the decrease in gains on equity securities was partially offset by a decrease in performance fees. The decrease in other
income (expense) was also driven by a decrease in gains on debt securities primarily due to an unrealized gain recognized in 2018 resulting from
the modification of the terms of a non-marketable debt security.
Performance fees of $1,203 million have been reclassified from general and administrative expenses to other income (expense), net, for 2018
to conform with current period presentation. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for further details.
Over time, other income (expense), net, as a percentage of revenues may be affected by market dynamics and other factors. Equity values
generally change daily for marketable equity securities and upon the occurrence of observable price changes or upon impairment of non-marketable
equity securities. In addition, volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets could result in a significant change in the value of our
equity securities. Fluctuations in the value of these investments has, and we expect will continue to, contribute to volatility of OI&E in future periods.
For additional information about equity investments, see Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II,

Provision for income taxes $ 4,177 $ 5,282
Effective tax rate 12.0% 13.3%
Our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate increased from 2018 to 2019, due to discrete events in 2018 and 2019. In 2018, we
released our deferred tax asset valuation allowance related to gains on equity securities and recognized the benefits of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act ("Tax Act"). In 2019, we recognized an increase in discrete benefits related to the resolution of multi-year audits, partially offset by the reversal of
Altera tax benefit as a result of the U.S. Court of Appeals decision. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part
II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
As of December 31, 2019, we have simplified our corporate legal entity structure and now license intellectual property from the U.S. that was
previously licensed from Bermuda. This will affect our geographic mix of earnings.
We expect our future effective tax rate to be affected by the geographic mix of earnings in countries with different statutory rates. Additionally,
our future effective tax rate may be affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations,
or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.

In November 2019, we entered into an agreement to acquire Fitbit, a leading wearables brand, for $7.35 per share, representing a total
purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion as of the date of the agreement. The acquisition of Fitbit is expected to be completed in 2020, subject to
customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals.
Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our
operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the long term growth of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital
structure, including the size, pace and form of capital return to stockholders.
We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program
are used for general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2019. We have $4.0 billion of revolving
credit facilities expiring in July 2023 with no amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2019. The interest rate for the credit facilities is determined
based on a formula using certain market rates. We believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash
requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, potential acquisitions and other liquidity requirements through at least the
next 12 months.
As of December 31, 2019, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding due in 2021, 2024, and 2026 with a total carrying value of $4.0 billion.
As of December 31, 2019, we had remaining authorization of $20.8 billion for repurchase of Class C capital stock. The repurchases are being
executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases
or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. Please refer to
Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information
related to share repurchases.
We continue to make significant investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology infrastructure
through purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our business. During the year ended
December 31, 2019, we spent $23.5 billion on capital expenditures and recognized total operating lease assets of $4.4 billion. As of December 31,
2019, the amount of total future lease payments under operating leases, which had a weighted average remaining lease term of 10 years, was $13.9
billion. Finance leases were not material for the year ended December 31, 2019. Please refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the leases.
The following table presents our cash flows (in millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2018 2019
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 47,971 $ 54,520
Net cash used in investing activities $ (28,504) $ (29,491)
Net cash used in financing activities $ (13,179) $ (23,209)
Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Our largest source of cash provided by our operations are advertising revenues generated by Google properties and Google Network
Members' properties. Additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps, in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing
and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings and subscription-based products.
Our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments to our Google Network Members and distribution partners, and
payments for content acquisition costs. In addition, uses of cash from operating activities include compensation and related costs, hardware
inventory costs, other general corporate expenditures, and income taxes.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to increases in cash received from revenues, offset by
increases in cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses.
Cash Used in Investing Activities
Cash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of our investments in marketable and non-marketable securities.
Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of property and

equipment, which primarily includes our investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology infrastructure to
provide capacity for the growth of our businesses; purchases of marketable and non-marketable securities; and payments for acquisitions.
Net cash used in investing activities increased from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to a net increase in purchases of securities and an increase in
payments for acquisitions, partially offset by a decrease in payments for purchases of property and equipment. The decrease in purchases of
property and equipment was driven by decreases in purchases of servers as well as land and buildings for offices, partially offset by an increase in
data center construction.
Cash Used in Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from sale of interest in consolidated
entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of net payments related to stock-based award activities, repurchases of capital stock, and
repayments of debt.
Net cash used in financing activities increased from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to an increase in cash payments for repurchases of capital
stock and a decrease in proceeds from sale of interest in consolidated entities.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that
affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, gains and losses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. In some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting
estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent
that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We
base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these
estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further
below. We have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.
Please see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of
significant accounting policies and the effect on our financial statements.
Revenues
For the sale of third-party goods and services, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenues on a gross basis, or an agent,
and report revenues on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are
transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in
establishing price.
Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions
and determining our provision for income taxes.
Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of
these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the
refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will
affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.
The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the
related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue
Services (IRS) and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting
from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
Loss Contingencies
We are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust, intellectual
property, privacy, consumer protection, non-income taxes, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and
services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for
substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the
amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose
the possible loss in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued,
and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate. Significant
judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. Until the final
resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of
our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Long-lived Assets
Long-lived assets, including property and equipment, long-term prepayments, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation is
performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated
undiscounted future cash flows generated
42

--- Page 44 ---

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
from the assets are less than their carrying amount. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of
the asset group over its fair value.
Fair Value Measurements
We measure certain of our non-marketable equity and debt investments, certain other instruments including stock-based compensation awards
settled in the stock of certain Other Bets, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
The determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate valuation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models. The fair value hierarchy
prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value whereby it gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. We maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs. Our use of unobservable inputs reflects the assumptions that market participants would use and may include our own data
adjusted based on reasonably available information. We apply judgment in assessing the relevance of observable market data to determine the
priority of inputs under the fair value hierarchy, particularly in situations where there is very little or no market activity.
In determining the fair values of our non-marketable equity and debt investments, as well as assets acquired (especially with respect to
intangible assets) and liabilities assumed in business combinations, we make significant estimates and assumptions, some of which include the use
of unobservable inputs.
Certain stock-based compensation awards may be settled in the stock of certain of our Other Bets or in cash. These awards are based on the
equity values of the respective Other Bet, which requires use of unobservable inputs.
We also have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized investment returns, i.e. performance fees. We recognize
compensation expense based on the estimated payouts, which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized, and may
require the use of unobservable inputs.
Non-marketable Equity Securities
Our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are carried either at fair value or under the measurement
alternative. Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from
observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Determining whether an observed
transaction is similar to a security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the rights and obligations of the securities. Recording upward and
downward adjustments to the carrying value of our equity securities as a result of observable price changes requires quantitative assessments of the
fair value of our securities using various valuation methodologies and involves the use of estimates.
Non-marketable equity securities are also subject to periodic impairment reviews. Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative
and quantitative factors that may have a significant effect on the investment's fair value. Qualitative factors considered include industry and market
conditions, financial performance, business prospects, and other relevant events and factors. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare
quantitative assessments of the fair value of our equity investments using both the market and income approaches which require judgment and the
use of estimates, including discount rates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among
others. When our assessment indicates that an impairment exists, we measure our non-marketable securities at fair value.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity investment risks.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
We transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenues, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign
currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. Principal currencies hedged included the
Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro and Japanese yen. For the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, we
considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in
exchange rates of 10% could be experienced in the near term.
We use foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other
than the local currency of the subsidiary. These forward contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate
movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign
43

--- Page 45 ---

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, which are offset by the gains and losses on the
forward contracts.
If an adverse 10% foreign currency exchange rate change was applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other
than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates, it would have resulted in an adverse effect on income before income taxes of approximately $1
million and $8 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. The adverse effect as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 is after consideration
of the offsetting effect of approximately $374 million and $662 million, respectively, from foreign exchange contracts in place for the years ended
December 31, 2018 and 2019.
We use foreign currency forwards and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and
written options) to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. When the U.S. dollar
strengthens, gains from foreign currency options and forwards reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings. When the U.S. dollar
weakens, losses from foreign currency collars and forwards offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings. These hedging contracts
reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for
accounting purposes. We reflect the gains or losses of foreign currency spot rate changes as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify
them into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur.
If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange
contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $772 million and $1.1 billion lower as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. The
change in the value recorded in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when
recognized.
We use foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment
in foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve to offset the foreign currency translation risk from our foreign operations.
If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI related to our net investment
hedge would have been approximately $635 million and $936 million lower as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. The change in value
recorded in CTA would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiaries.
Interest Rate Risk
Our Corporate Treasury investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity. We invest
primarily in debt securities including those of the U.S. government and its agencies, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, money
market and other funds, municipal securities, time deposits, asset backed securities, and debt instruments issued by foreign governments. By policy,
we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a
degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate
securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Unrealized gains or losses on our marketable debt securities are primarily
due to interest rate fluctuations as a result of higher market interest rates compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. We account for both
fixed and variable rate securities at fair value with gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold.
We use value-at-risk (VaR) analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuations in interest rates on the value of our marketable debt
security portfolio. The VaR is the expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, for our investment portfolio due to adverse movements
in interest rates. We use a variance/covariance VaR model with 95% confidence interval. The estimated one-day loss in fair value of our marketable
debt securities as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 are shown below (in millions):
12-Month Average
As of December 31, As of December 31,
2018 2019 2018 2019
Risk Category - Interest Rate $ 58 $ 104 $ 66 $ 90
Actual future gains and losses associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses
performed as of December 31, 2018 and 2019 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the timing and amount of changes in interest
rates and our actual exposures and positions. VaR analysis is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation.

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
Equity Investment Risk
Our marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could substantially reduce or
increase the fair value of our holdings.
Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds and our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held
companies, some of which are in the startup or development stages.
We record our marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable market
values, of which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject to market price volatility, and represent $3.3 billion of our investments as of
December 31, 2019. A hypothetical adverse price change of 10%, which could be experienced in the near term, would decrease the fair value of our
marketable equity securities by $330 million.
Our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for
identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement alternative). The fair value is measured at the time
of the observable transaction, which is not necessarily an indication of the current fair value as of the balance sheet date. These investments,
especially those that are in the early stages, are inherently risky because the technologies or products these companies have under development
are typically in the early phases and may never materialize and they may experience a decline in financial condition, which could result in a loss of a
substantial part of our investment in these companies. The success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on the
likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of our investments through liquidity events such as public offerings, acquisitions, private
sales or other favorable market events. As of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted
for under the measurement alternative, was $11.4 billion. Valuations of our equity investments in private companies are inherently more complex
due to the lack of readily available market data. Volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets could result in a significant impairment
charge on our non-marketable equity securities.
The carrying values of our equity method investments generally do not fluctuate based on market price changes, however these investments
could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.
For further information about our equity investments, please refer to Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Alphabet Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, the
related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the
“financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at
December 31, 2018 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the
Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 3,
2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Adoption of New Accounting Standard
As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company changed its method for accounting for the recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure of certain equity securities in the year ended December 31, 2018.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s
financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with
respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits
included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was
communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter
does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter
below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Loss Contingencies
Description of the The Company is regularly subject to claims, suits, and government investigations involving competition, intellectual
Matter property, privacy, consumer protection, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by its users,
goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using their platforms, and other matters. As described in Note 10 to
the financial statements “Commitments and Contingencies” such claims could result in adverse consequences.
Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood, and the estimated amount, of a loss related to such
matters. Auditing management’s accounting for and disclosure of loss contingencies from these matters involved
challenging and subjective auditor judgement in assessing the Company’s evaluation of the probability of a loss, and the
estimated amount or range of loss.
How We Addressed We tested relevant controls over the identified risks associated with management’s accounting for and disclosure of these
the Matter in Our Audit matters. This included controls over management’s assessment of the probability of incurrence of a loss and whether the
loss or range of loss was reasonably estimable and the development of related disclosures.
Our audit procedures included gaining an understanding of previous rulings issued by regulators and the status of ongoing
lawsuits, reviewing letters addressing the matters from internal and external legal counsel, meeting with internal legal
counsel to discuss the allegations, and obtaining a representation letter from management on these matters. We also
evaluated the Company’s disclosures in relation to these matters.

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Alphabet Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Operations
Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015, we
implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. (Alphabet) became the successor issuer to Google.
We generate revenues primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated under the variable interest and
voting models. Noncontrolling interests are not presented separately as the amounts are not material. All intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
Preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP)
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the bad
debt allowance, sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property
and equipment, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking,
that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenues when we transfer control of promised goods or services to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.
See Note 2 for further discussion on Revenues.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.
TAC represents the amounts paid to Google Network Members primarily for ads displayed on their properties and amounts paid to our
distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers,
original equipment manufacturers, and software developers.
Other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding TAC) includes the following:
• Content acquisition costs primarily related to payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution
on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee);
• Expenses associated with our data centers and other operations (including bandwidth, compensation expense (including SBC),
depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs); and
• Inventory related costs for hardware we sell.
Stock-based Compensation
Stock-based compensation primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity classified and measured at the fair
market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite
service period and account for forfeitures as they occur.
For RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory tax withholding to be paid by us on behalf of our employees.
As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding and the tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in
capital.
Additionally, stock-based compensation includes stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) and awards that may be
settled in cash or the stock of certain of our Other Bets. PSUs are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period.
Awards that are liability classified are remeasured at fair value through
55

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
settlement or maturity (six months and one day after vesting). The fair value of such awards is based on the equity valuation of the respective Other
Bet.
Performance Fees
We have compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized investment returns. We recognize compensation expense based on the
estimated payouts, which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized. Performance fees, which are primarily related to
gains on equity securities, are recorded as a component of other income (expense), net.
Certain Risks and Concentrations
Our revenues are primarily derived from online advertising, the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing. In addition, our
revenues are generated from a multitude of markets in countries around the world. Significant changes in this industry or changes in customer
buying or advertiser spending behavior could adversely affect our operating results.
No individual customer or groups of affiliated customers represented more than 10% of our revenues in 2017, 2018, or 2019. In 2017, 2018,
and 2019, we generated approximately 47%, 46%, and 46% of our revenues, respectively, from customers based in the U.S.
We are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally from cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign exchange contracts,
and accounts receivable. We manage our credit risk exposure through timely assessment of our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits and use
of collateral management.
Cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of time deposits, money market and other funds, highly liquid debt instruments of
the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, debt instruments issued by municipalities in the U.S.,
corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various
financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers
located around the world. We perform ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend. We generally
do not require collateral from our customers. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have generally been within our
expectations.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Our financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash equivalents, marketable securities,
derivative contracts, and non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable
equity securities, which are adjusted to fair value when observable price changes are identified or when the non-marketable equity securities are
impaired (referred to as the measurement alternative). Other financial assets and liabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.
Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair
value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:
Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
Level 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in
markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be
derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present
value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.
The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when
measuring fair value.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities
We invest all excess cash primarily in government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, time
deposits, and money market funds.

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
We classify all marketable investments that have stated maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents and
those with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities.
We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such
designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After
consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their stated
maturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond 12
months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and
report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders’ equity, except for unrealized losses determined to be other-
than-temporary, which we record within other income (expense), net. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable debt
securities on a specific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of other income (expense), net.
Non-Marketable Investments
We account for non-marketable equity investments through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee
under the equity method. Our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are primarily accounted for under the
measurement alternative in accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01, which we adopted on January 1, 2018. Under the
measurement alternative, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments is adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for
identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the
transaction date.
We account for our non-marketable investments that meet the definition of a debt security as available-for-sale securities.
We classify our non-marketable investments that do not have stated contractual maturity dates, as non-current assets on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.
Impairment of Investments
We periodically review our debt and equity investments for impairment. For debt securities we consider the duration, severity and the reason
for the decline in security value; whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost
basis; or if the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will
write down the security to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as other income (expense), net. For equity securities we consider
impairment indicators such as negative changes in industry and market conditions, financial performance, business prospects, and other relevant
events and factors. If indicators exist and the fair value of the security is below the carrying amount, we write down the security to fair value.
Variable Interest Entities
We determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in which we have other
variable interests in is considered a variable interest entity (VIE). We consolidate VIEs when we are the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary
of a VIE is the party that meets both of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic
performance of the VIE; and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant
to the VIE. Periodically, we assess whether any changes in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is
still a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary. If we are not the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other
variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.
Accounts Receivable
We record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible
receivables. We review the accounts receivable by amounts due from customers that are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes
or collectability issues. In determining the amount of the reserve, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on
ongoing credit evaluations.
Our payment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when
payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, we require payment before the products or services are
delivered to the customer.
57

Leases
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Payments
under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine
fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the
amount of our lease assets and liabilities.
Certain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets and liabilities.
These amounts include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments contingent on wind or solar production for power purchase
arrangements, and payments for maintenance and utilities.
Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest
rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our
leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar
terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or
terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base, non-cancelable, lease term when
determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives.
Operating lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet beginning January 1, 2019. The current portion of our
operating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and the long term portion is included in operating lease
liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other
current liabilities or long-term debt.
Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets, construction in progress,
leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices, data centers and related building improvements.
Information technology assets include servers and network equipment. We account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated
depreciation. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We depreciate buildings over
periods of seven to 25 years. We depreciate information technology assets generally over periods of three to five years (specifically, three years for
servers and three to five years for network equipment).
We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Construction in
progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for our intended use. Depreciation
for equipment, buildings, and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated.
Inventory
Inventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is computed using the first-in,
first-out method.
Software Development Costs
We expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be sold,
leased, or marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. Technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the
release of such products and as a result, development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.
Software development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud based applications used
to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it
is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such
software applications were not material for the periods presented.
Business Combinations
We include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of the
acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair
58

--- Page 61 ---

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related
expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.
Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets
We review property and equipment, long-term prepayments and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when events or changes
in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying
amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If the carrying value of the assets are
not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Impairments
were not material for the periods presented.
We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units when
changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for
impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill
impairments were not material for the periods presented.
Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We amortize intangible assets on a straight-line basis with
definite lives generally over periods ranging from one to twelve years.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the
current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements
or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the realization of our
deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not
that they will not be realized.
We recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on technical merits, the position will be
sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial statements are then measured based on the largest amount
of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties
related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.
Foreign Currency
Generally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these
subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-
end exchange rates for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI)
as a component of stockholders’ equity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the
transaction currency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in other income (expense), net.
Advertising and Promotional Expenses
We expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and
2019, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $5.1 billion, $6.4 billion, and $6.8 billion, respectively.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 (ASU 2016-13) "Financial
Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments", which requires the measurement and recognition
of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an
expected loss model which requires the use of forward-looking information to calculate credit loss estimates. It also eliminates the concept of other-
than-temporary impairment and requires credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit
losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. These changes will result in earlier recognition of credit losses. We will
adopt ASU 2016-13 effective January 1, 2020 with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings. The effect on
our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures is not expected to be material.

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 (Topic 842) "Leases." Topic 842 supersedes the lease
requirements in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 840, "Leases." Under Topic 842, lessees are required to recognize assets and liabilities on
the balance sheet for most leases and provide enhanced disclosures. Leases continue to be classified as either finance or operating. We adopted
Topic 842 effective January 1, 2019. The most significant effects of Topic 842 were the recognition of $8.0 billion of operating lease assets and $8.4
billion of operating lease liabilities and the de-recognition of $1.5 billion of build-to-suit assets and liabilities upon adoption. We applied Topic 842 to
all leases as of January 1, 2019 with comparative periods continuing to be reported under Topic 840. In the adoption of Topic 842, we carried
forward the assessment from Topic 840 of whether our contracts contain or are leases, the classification of our leases, and remaining lease terms.
Our accounting for finance leases remains substantially unchanged. The standard did not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of
operations or cash flows. See Note 4 for further details.
Prior Period Reclassifications
Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation. Hedging gains (losses), which were
previously included in Google revenues, are now reported separately as a component of total revenues for all periods presented. See Note 2 for
further details.
Additionally, performance fees have been reclassified for all periods from general and administrative expenses to other income (expense), net
to align with the presentation of the investment gains and losses on which the performance fees are based. See Note 7 for further details.
Note 2. Revenues
Revenue Recognition
Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that we expect in
exchange for those goods or services. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from revenues.
The following table presents our revenues disaggregated by type (in millions). Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to
conform with current period presentation.

Advertising Revenues
We generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on Google properties, including Google.com, the Google Search app,
YouTube, Google Play, Gmail and Google Maps; and Google Network Members’ properties.
Our customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager as part of the Authorized Buyers
marketplace, and Google Marketing Platform, among others.
We offer advertising on a click, impression or view basis. We recognize revenue each time a user clicks on the ad, when the ad is displayed or
a user views the ad.
For ads placed on Google Network Members’ properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or
agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network Members’ properties on a
gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts paid to Google Network Members are recorded as
cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced
by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers, and is further supported by us being primarily
responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.
Google Cloud Revenues
Google Cloud revenues consist primarily of revenues from Google Cloud Platform (which includes infrastructure and data and analytics
platform products, and other services), G Suite productivity tools and other enterprise cloud services. Our cloud revenues are provided on either a
consumption or subscription basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis is recognized when the customer utilizes the
services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over
the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services.
Other Revenues
Google other revenues and Other Bets revenues consist primarily of revenues from:
• Google Play, which includes revenues from sale of apps and in-app purchases (which we recognize net of payout to developers) and digital
content sold in the Google Play store;
• hardware, including Google Nest home products, Pixelbooks, Pixel phones and other devices;
• YouTube non-advertising including, YouTube premium and YouTube TV subscriptions and other services; and
• other products and services.
As it relates to Google other revenues, the most significant judgment is determining whether we are the principal or agent for app sales and in-
app purchases through the Google Play store. We report revenues from these transactions on a net basis because our performance obligation is to
facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users, for which we earn a commission. Consequently, the portion of the gross amount
billed to end users that is remitted to app developers is not reflected as revenues.
Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations
Our contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenues to each
performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged
to customers or using expected cost plus margin.

Customer Incentives and Credits
Certain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts
based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our
estimates of variable consideration.
Deferred Revenues
We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are
refundable. The increase in the deferred revenue balance for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily driven by cash payments received or
due in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, offset by $1.7 billion of revenues recognized that were included in the deferred revenue
balance as of December 31, 2018.
Additionally, we have performance obligations associated with commitments in customer contracts, primarily related to Google Cloud, for future
services that have not yet been recognized in revenue. This includes related deferred revenue currently recorded and amounts that will be invoiced
in future periods. As of December 31, 2019, the amount not yet recognized in revenue from these commitments is $11.4 billion, which reflects our
assessment of relevant contract terms. This amount excludes contracts (i) with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for
which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed. We expect to recognize approximately two
thirds over the next 24 months with the remaining thereafter. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer
utilization, which could impact our estimate of the remaining amount of commitments and when we expect to recognize such revenues.
Sales Commissions
We generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are
recorded within sales and marketing expenses.
Note 3. Financial Instruments
Debt Securities
We classify our marketable debt securities within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted market prices to the extent
available or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value.

During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, we did not recognize any significant other-than-temporary impairment losses.
Equity Investments
The following discusses our marketable equity securities, non-marketable equity securities, gains and losses on marketable and non-
marketable equity securities, as well as our equity securities accounted for under the equity method.
Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds measured at fair value and classified within Level 1 and 2 in the fair value
hierarchy because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in
active markets. All gains and losses on marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net.
Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. The carrying
value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same
issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement alternative). All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized,
are recognized in other income (expense), net. Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period are classified within
Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based on valuation methods using the observable transaction price at
the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.
Gains and losses on marketable and non-marketable equity securities
Gains and losses reflected in other income (expense), net, for our marketable and non-marketable equity securities are summarized below (in
millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2018 2019
Net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period $ 1,458 $ (301)

respectively.
In the table above, net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying
value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later.
Cumulative net gains on equity securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following table (in millions), represents the total net
gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity security. While these net gains may have been reflected in periods prior to the
period of sale, we believe they are important supplemental information as they reflect the economic realized gain on the securities sold during the
period. Cumulative net gains is calculated as the difference between the sale price and the initial purchase price for the equity security sold during
the period.

Equity securities accounted for under the Equity Method
Equity securities accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of approximately $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2019.
Our share of gains and losses including impairment are included as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of
Income. See Note 7 for further details on other income (expense), net.
Derivative Financial Instruments
We classify our foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation inputs
are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments.
We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. We record changes in the
fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of the derivatives in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other income (expense), net, or revenues, or in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets in AOCI, as discussed below. Any components excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are
recognized in the same income statement line as the hedged item.
We enter into foreign currency contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign
subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also use interest rate derivative contracts to hedge interest
rate exposures on our fixed income securities and debt issuances. Our program is not used for trading or speculative purposes.
We enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To
further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements under which the counterparty is required to provide collateral when the net
fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. We can take possession of the collateral in the event
of counterparty default. As of December 31, 2018 and 2019, we received cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under our collateral
security arrangements of $327 million and $252 million, respectively, which was included in other current assets.
Cash Flow Hedges
We use foreign currency forwards and option contracts, including collars (an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and
written options), designated as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S.
dollar. The notional principal of these contracts was approximately $11.8 billion and $13.2 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
These contracts have maturities of 24 months or less.
For forwards and option contracts, we exclude the change in the forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness.
The initial value of the excluded component is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging instrument and recognized in revenues.
The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. We reflect the
gains or losses of a cash flow hedge included in our hedge effective assessment as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify these gains
and losses to revenues when the hedged transactions are recorded. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding
amounts in AOCI are immediately reclassified to other income (expense), net.
As of December 31, 2019, the net accumulated loss on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $82 million, of which $82
million is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months.
Fair Value Hedges
We use forward contracts designated as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated in currencies other
than the U.S. dollar. We exclude changes in forward points for the forward contracts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We recognize
changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net. The notional principal of these contracts was $2.0 billion and $455 million as of
December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains and losses of the
related hedged items.
Net Investment Hedges
We use forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our investment in foreign
subsidiaries. We exclude changes in forward points for the forward contracts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. We recognize changes in
the excluded component in other income (expense),

net. The notional principal of these contracts was $6.7 billion and $9.3 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
Gains and losses on these forward contracts are recognized in AOCI as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment.
Other Derivatives
Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we use to hedge intercompany
transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a subsidiary. We recognize gains and
losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs in other income (expense), net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary
assets and liabilities. The notional principal of the outstanding foreign exchange contracts was $20.1 billion and $43.5 billion as of December 31,
2018 and 2019, respectively.

Note 5. Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)
Consolidated VIEs
We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary because we have the
power to direct activities that most significantly affect their economic performance and have the obligation to absorb the majority of their losses or
benefits. The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.
For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2018 and
2019, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $2.4 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, and the liabilities for which
creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $909 million and $1.2 billion, respectively.

Calico
Calico is a life science company with a mission to harness advanced technologies to increase our understanding of the biology that controls
lifespan.
In September 2014, AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie) and Calico entered into a research and development collaboration agreement intended to help both
companies discover, develop, and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. In
the second quarter of 2018, AbbVie and Calico amended the collaboration agreement resulting in an increase in total commitments. As of
December 31, 2019, AbbVie has contributed $1,250 million to fund the collaboration pursuant to the agreement. As of December 31, 2019, Calico
has contributed $500 million and has committed up to an additional $750 million.
Calico has used its scientific expertise to establish a world-class research and development facility, with a focus on drug discovery and early
drug development; and AbbVie provides scientific and clinical development support and its commercial expertise to bring new discoveries to market.
Both companies share costs and profits for projects covered under this agreement equally. AbbVie's contribution has been recorded as a liability on
Calico's financial statements, which is reduced and reflected as a reduction to research and development expense as eligible research and
development costs are incurred by Calico.
As of December 31, 2019, we have contributed $480 million to Calico in exchange for Calico convertible preferred units and are committed to
fund up to an additional $750 million on an as-needed basis and subject to certain conditions.
Verily
Verily is a life science and healthcare company with a mission to make the world's health data useful so that people enjoy healthier lives. In
December 2018, Verily received $900 million in cash from a $1.0 billion investment round. The remaining $100 million was received in the first
quarter of 2019. As of December 31, 2019, Verily has received an aggregate amount of $1.8 billion from sales of equity securities to external
investors. These transactions were accounted for as equity transactions and no gain or loss was recognized.
In the fourth quarter of 2019, Verily obtained a controlling financial interest in Onduo, an existing equity method investment. The transaction
resulted in a $357 million gain from the revaluation of the previously held economic interest, which was recognized in other income (expense), net.
Unconsolidated VIEs
Certain of our non-marketable investments, including certain renewable energy investments accounted for under the equity method and certain
other investments in private companies, are VIEs. The renewable energy entities' activities involve power generation using renewable sources.
Private companies that we invest in are primarily early stage companies.
We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their
economic performance. Therefore, we do not consolidate these VIEs in our consolidated financial statements.
The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future
funding commitments. We have determined that the single source of our exposure to these VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying
value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs were not material as of December 31, 2018 and 2019.
Note 6. Debt
Short-Term Debt
We have a debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for
general corporate purposes. We had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2018 and 2019.
Long-Term Debt
Google issued $3.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in three tranches (collectively, 2011 Notes) in May 2011, due in 2014, 2016, and 2021, as
well as $1.0 billion of senior unsecured notes (2014 Notes) in February 2014 due in 2024.
In April 2016, we completed an exchange offer with eligible holders of Google’s 2011 Notes due 2021 and 2014 Notes due 2024 (collectively,
the Google Notes). An aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.7 billion of the Google Notes was exchanged for approximately $1.7 billion of
Alphabet notes with identical interest rate and maturity.

--- Page 75 ---

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
Because the exchange was between a parent and the subsidiary company and for substantially identical notes, the change was treated as a debt
modification for accounting purposes with no gain or loss recognized.
In August 2016, Alphabet issued $2.0 billion of senior unsecured notes (2016 Notes) due 2026. The net proceeds from the issuance of the
2016 Notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper. The Alphabet notes due in 2021,
2024, and 2026 rank equally with each other and are structurally subordinate to the outstanding Google Notes.

The effective interest yields based on proceeds received from the outstanding notes due in 2021, 2024, and 2026 were 3.734%, 3.377%, and
2.231%, respectively, with interest payable semi-annually. We may redeem these notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption
prices. The total estimated fair value of all outstanding notes was approximately $3.9 billion and $4.1 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2019,
respectively. The fair value was determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized
accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Note 8. Acquisitions
2019 Acquisitions
Looker
In December 2019, we obtained all regulatory clearances necessary to close the acquisition of Looker, a unified platform for business
intelligence, data applications and embedded analytics for $2.4 billion, with integration pending approval from a UK regulatory review. The addition
of Looker to Google Cloud is expected to help customers accelerate how they analyze data, deliver business intelligence, and build data-driven
applications.
The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded based on a preliminary valuation and our estimates and assumptions
are subject to change within the measurement period. The $2.4 billion purchase price includes our previously held equity interest and excludes post
acquisition compensation arrangements. In aggregate, $91 million was cash acquired, $290 million was attributed to intangible assets, $1.9 billion to
goodwill and $48 million to net assets acquired. Goodwill was recorded in the Google segment and primarily attributable to synergies expected to
arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Other Acquisitions
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we completed other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for total consideration of
approximately $1.0 billion. In aggregate, $28 million was cash acquired, $282 million was attributed to intangible assets, $904 million to goodwill and
$185 million to net liabilities assumed. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings and expand our expertise in
engineering and other functional areas.
Pro forma results of operations for these acquisitions, including Looker, have not been presented because they are not material to the
consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the aggregate.
For all intangible assets acquired and purchased during the year ended December 31, 2019, patents and developed technology have a
weighted-average useful life of 3.5 years, customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 6.3 years, and trade names and other have
a weighted-average useful life of 4.5 years.
Pending Acquisition of Fitbit
In November 2019, we entered into an agreement to acquire Fitbit, a leading wearables brand, for $7.35 per share, representing a total
purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion as of the date of the agreement. The acquisition

Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies
Purchase Obligations
As of December 31, 2019, we had $5.7 billion of other non-cancelable contractual obligations, primarily related to data center operations and
build-outs, digital media content licensing, and purchases of inventory.
Indemnifications
In the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions in our services and products, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers,
Google Network Members, customers of Google Cloud offerings, and lessors with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties
harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made
against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In
addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations
to our agents.
It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique
facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the
payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial
position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.
As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible.
Legal Matters
Antitrust Investigations
On November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints against
us.
On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping search
results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September
11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with
the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017.
On July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related distribution agreements infringed
European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct
at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision. On October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution
practices. We recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2018.
On March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google had with AdSense for Search
partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions
related to AdSense for Search agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision. We
recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.

Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
While each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.
From time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition authorities in the United States, Europe, and
other jurisdictions. For example, in August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice requesting
information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain of our business practices. Attorneys general from 51 U.S. states
and territories have also opened antitrust investigations into certain of our business practices. We continue to cooperate with federal and state
regulators in the United States, and other regulators around the world.
Patent and Intellectual Property Claims
We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products,
services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary
damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a
result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues
for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to
litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the
U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from
importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.
Furthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against certain intellectual property
infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there
were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and
technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.
In 2010, Oracle America, Inc. (Oracle) brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of California, alleging that Google's
Android operating system infringes Oracle's copyrights related to certain Java application programming interfaces. After trial, final judgment was
entered by the district court in favor of Google on June 8, 2016, and the court decided post-trial motions in favor of Google. Oracle appealed and on
March 27, 2018, the appeals court reversed and remanded the case for a trial on damages. On May 29, 2018, we filed a petition for a rehearing at
the Federal Circuit, and on August 28, 2018, the Federal Circuit denied the petition. On January 24, 2019, we filed a petition to the Supreme Court of
the United States to review this case. On April 29, 2019, the Supreme Court requested the views of the Solicitor General regarding our petition. On
September 27, 2019, the Solicitor General recommended denying our petition, and we provided our response on October 16, 2019. On November
15, 2019, the Supreme Court granted our petition and made a decision to review the case. If the Supreme Court does not rule in our favor, the case
will be remanded to the district court for further determination of the remaining issues in the case, including damages, if any. We believe this lawsuit
is without merit and are defending ourselves vigorously. Given the nature of this case, we are unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or
range of loss, if any, arising from this matter.
Other
We are also regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition,
intellectual property, privacy, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and
services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Such claims, suits,
regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other adverse consequences.
Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. We record a liability when we believe
that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and
the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could
affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make
adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related
to such matters.
With respect to our outstanding matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will
not, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business,

consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to
significant uncertainties.
We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.
Non-Income Taxes
We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income
tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and
the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements
with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range
of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We believe these matters are without merit and we are defending ourselves
vigorously. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be
materially different from our expectations.
For information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 14.
Note 11. Stockholders' Equity
Convertible Preferred Stock
Our board of directors has authorized 100 million shares of convertible preferred stock, $0.001 par value, issuable in series. As of December
31, 2018 and 2019, no shares were issued or outstanding.
Class A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock
Our board of directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C capital stock. The rights of the
holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to
one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as
required by applicable law. Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically
convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.
Share Repurchases
In January 2018, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $8.6 billion of its Class C capital stock. In
January and July 2019, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $12.5 billion and $25.0 billion of
its Class C capital stock, respectively. Share repurchases pursuant to the January 2018 and January 2019 authorizations were completed in 2019.
The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities,
through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have
an expiration date.
During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, we repurchased and subsequently retired 8.2 million shares of Alphabet Class C capital
stock for an aggregate amount of $9.1 billion and 15.3 million shares of Alphabet Class C capital stock for an aggregate amount of $18.4 billion,
respectively.
Note 12. Net Income Per Share
We compute net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock using the two-class method. Basic net
income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is
computed using the weighted-average number of shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially
dilutive securities consist of restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock units and
other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the
diluted net income per share of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted net income per share of
Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.
The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock are
identical, except with respect to voting. Furthermore, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware
law, which preclude our board of directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock and
Class C capital stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of
adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely
80

affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a
stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our board of directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are
allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shares and Class C capital stock as if the earnings for the
year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis.
In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, the net income per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class B common
stock and Class C capital stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation in
accordance with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc.
The following tables set forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock and Class C
capital stock (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and per share amounts):

Note 13. Compensation Plans
Stock Plans
Under our 2012 Stock Plan, RSUs or stock options may be granted. An RSU award is an agreement to issue shares of our publicly traded
stock at the time the award vests. Incentive and non-qualified stock options, or rights to purchase common stock, are generally granted for a term of
10 years. RSUs granted to participants under the 2012 Stock Plan generally vest over four years contingent upon employment or service with us on
the vesting date.
As of December 31, 2019, there were 37,982,435 shares of stock reserved for future issuance under our Stock Plan.
Additionally, we have stock-based awards that may be settled in the stock of certain of our Other Bets.
Stock-Based Compensation
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, total stock-based compensation expense was $7.9 billion, $10.0 billion and $11.7
billion, including amounts associated with awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock of $7.7 billion, $9.4 billion, and $10.8 billion, respectively.
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, we recognized tax benefits on total stock-based compensation expense, which are
reflected in the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income, of $1.6 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.8 billion, respectively.
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, tax benefit realized related to awards vested or exercised during the period was $2.7
billion, $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. These amounts do not include the indirect effects of stock-based awards, which primarily relate to
the research and development tax credit.
Stock-Based Award Activities
The following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs in Alphabet stock for the year ended December 31, 2019:
Unvested Restricted Stock Units
Weighted-
Average
Number of Grant-Date
Shares Fair Value
Unvested as of December 31, 2018 18,467,678 $ 936.96
Granted 13,934,041 $ 1,092.36
Vested (11,576,766) $ 919.28
Forfeited/canceled (1,430,717) $ 990.56
Unvested as of December 31, 2019 19,394,236 $ 1,055.22
The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, was $845.06 and
$1,095.89, respectively. Total fair value of RSUs, as of their respective vesting dates, during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018, and 2019
were $11.3 billion, $14.1 billion, and $15.2 billion, respectively.
As of December 31, 2019, there was $19.1 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested employee RSUs. This amount is
expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years.
401(k) Plans
We have two 401(k) Savings Plans that qualify as deferred salary arrangements under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under
these 401(k) Plans, matching contributions are based upon the amount of the employees’ contributions subject to certain limitations. We recognized
expense of approximately $448 million, $691 million, and $724 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively.

Note 14. Income Taxes
Income from continuing operations before income taxes consists of the following (in millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2017 2018 2019
Domestic operations $ 10,680 $ 15,779 $ 16,426
Foreign operations 16,513 19,134 23,199

Year Ended December 31,
2017 2018 2019
Current:
Federal and state $ 12,608 $ 2,153 $ 2,424

Total 177 773 145
Provision for income taxes $ 14,531 $ 4,177 $ 5,282
The Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017 introduced significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective 2018, the Tax Act reduced the
U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and created new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain related-party payments.
Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the Tax Act, we made reasonable estimates of the
effects and recorded provisional amounts in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017. As we collected and prepared
necessary data, and interpreted the additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, we
made adjustments, over the course of 2018, to the provisional amounts including refinements to deferred taxes. The accounting for the tax effects of
the Tax Act was completed as of December 31, 2018.
Transition tax
The Tax Act required us to pay U.S. income taxes on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a
rate of 15.5% to the extent of foreign cash and certain other net current assets and 8% on the remaining earnings. We recorded a provisional
amount for our transitional tax liability and income tax expense of $10.2 billion as of December 31, 2017. Subsequent adjustments in 2018 and 2019
were not material.
Deferred tax effects
Due to the change in the statutory tax rate from the Tax Act, we remeasured our deferred taxes as of December 31, 2017 to reflect the reduced
rate that will apply in future periods when these deferred taxes are settled or realized. We recognized a deferred tax benefit of $376 million to reflect
the reduced U.S. tax rate and other effects of the Tax Act as of December 31, 2017.

The reconciliation of federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate is as follows:
Year Ended December 31,
2017 2018 2019
U.S. federal statutory tax rate 35.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %
Foreign income taxed at different rates (14.2) (4.9) (5.6)
Effect of the Tax Act
Transition tax 37.6 (0.1) (0.6)
Deferred tax effects (1.4) (1.2) 0.0
Federal research credit (1.8) (2.4) (2.5)
Stock-based compensation expense (4.5) (2.2) (0.7)
European Commission fines 3.5 3.1 1.0
Deferred tax asset valuation allowance 0.9 (2.0) 0.0
State and local income taxes 0.1 (0.4) 1.1
Other adjustments (1.8) 1.1 (0.4)
Effective tax rate 53.4 % 12.0 % 13.3 %
Our effective tax rate for each of the years presented was affected by earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower
than the federal statutory tax rate. Substantially all of the income from foreign operations was earned by an Irish subsidiary. Beginning in 2018,
earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions are subject to U.S. tax in accordance with the Tax Act.
On July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court, in an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, invalidated the portion of the Treasury
regulations issued under IRC Section 482 requiring related-party participants in a cost sharing arrangement to share stock-based compensation
costs. The U.S. Tax Court issued the final decision on December 28, 2015. As a result of that decision, we recorded a tax benefit related to the
anticipated reimbursement of cost share payment for previously shared stock-based compensation costs.
On June 7, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned the 2015 Tax Court decision in Altera Corp. v.
Commissioner, and upheld the portion of the Treasury regulations issued under IRC Section 482 requiring related-party participants in a cost sharing
arrangement to share stock-based compensation costs. As a result of the Ninth Circuit court decision, our cumulative net tax benefit of $418 million
related to previously shared stock-based compensation costs was reversed in the year ended December 31, 2019.

Deferred Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows
(in millions):
As of December 31,
2018 2019
Deferred tax assets:
Stock-based compensation expense $ 291 $ 421
Accrued employee benefits 387 463
Accruals and reserves not currently deductible 902 1,047
Tax credits 1,979 3,264
Basis difference in investment in Arris 657 0
Prepaid cost sharing 597 0
Net operating losses 557 771
Operating leases 160 1,876
Other 21 390
Total deferred tax assets 5,551 8,232
Valuation allowance (2,817) (3,502)
Total deferred tax assets net of valuation allowance 2,734 4,730
Deferred tax liabilities:
Property and equipment, net (1,382) (1,798)
Renewable energy investments (500) (466)
Foreign Earnings (111) (373)
Net investment gains (1,143) (1,074)
Operating leases 0 (1,619)
Other (125) (380)
Total deferred tax liabilities (3,261) (5,710)
Net deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ (527) $ (980)
As of December 31, 2019, our federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $1.8
billion, $3.1 billion, and $1.9 billion respectively. If not utilized, the federal and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2021
and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2020. It is more likely than not that certain net operating loss carryforwards will
not be realized; therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance against them. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual
limitations under the tax laws of the different jurisdictions.
As of December 31, 2019, our California research and development credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $3.0
billion that can be carried over indefinitely. We believe the state tax credit is not likely to be realized.
As of December 31, 2019, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to California deferred tax assets, certain federal net operating
losses, certain state tax credits and certain foreign net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized. Due to gains from equity
securities recognized, we released the valuation allowance in 2018 against the deferred tax asset for the book-to-tax basis difference in our
investments in Arris shares received from the sale of the Motorola Home business to Arris in 2013. We continue to reassess the remaining valuation
allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.

Uncertain Tax Positions
The following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):
Year Ended December 31,
2017 2018 2019
Beginning gross unrecognized tax benefits $ 5,393 $ 4,696 $ 4,652
Increases related to prior year tax positions 685 321 938
Decreases related to prior year tax positions (257) (623) (143)
Decreases related to settlement with tax authorities (1,875) (191) (2,886)
Increases related to current year tax positions 750 449 816
Ending gross unrecognized tax benefits $ 4,696 $ 4,652 $ 3,377
The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $4.7 billion, $4.7 billion, and $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2017, 2018, and 2019,
respectively, of which, $3.0 billion, $2.9 billion, and $2.3 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, respectively. The decrease in gross
unrecognized tax benefits in 2017 and 2019 was primarily as a result of the resolution of multi-year audits.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2019, we had accrued $490 million and $130 million in interest and penalties in provision for income taxes,
respectively.
We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions, our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S.
federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS completed
its examination through our 2015 tax years; all issues have been concluded and the IRS will commence its examination of our 2016 through 2018
tax returns. We have also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent
establishment. We continue to defend any and all such claims as presented.
The tax years 2011 through 2018 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are
other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.
We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for
income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the
statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.
We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax
audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's
expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution,
settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will materially change
in the next 12 months.
Note 15. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
We operate our business in multiple operating segments. Google is our only reportable segment. None of our other segments meet the
quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, the other operating segments are combined and disclosed as Other Bets.
Our reported segments are:
• Google – Google includes our main products such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Play, Search,
and YouTube. Our technical infrastructure is also included in Google. Google generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps,
in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings
and subscription-based products.
• Other Bets – Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Other Bets includes Access,
Calico, CapitalG, GV, Verily, Waymo, and X, among others. Revenues from the Other Bets are derived primarily through the sales of
internet and TV services through Access as well as licensing and R&D services through Verily.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, our disclosure controls
and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to
disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We rely extensively on information systems to manage our business and summarize and report operating results. In 2019, we began a multi-
year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system, which will replace much of our existing core financial systems.
The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain the Company’s financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data
management and provide timely information to the Company’s management team. The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next
several years, with initial changes to our general ledger and consolidated financial reporting to take place in 2020. There have been no changes in
our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. However, as the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we will
change our processes and procedures which, in turn, could result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting. As such changes occur,
we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
of the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the
framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013
framework). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,
2019. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is
included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure
controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating
the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
